1709257864.0,"SO Sick Of Hearing About The ""Patriarchy""","I'm sure I'm far from the only one here who's sick and tired to death of seeing or hearing this stupid term thrown around and being blamed for everything wrong in the world and even men's problems being blamed on it. Earlier at work today when looking for a book for a customer in the business section, I kid you not, there was a book that had a blurb on it about ""the patriarchy's BS"" and I damn near had a swearing fit. I'm beyond fed up with this ridiculous term and idealogy about this completely imaginary boogeyman that supposedly isn't only what's the bane of women's existence but also is responsible for men's issues, when the BS ""patriarchy hurts men too"" argument is thrown around. I don't for one second believe it's a real and tangible thing, and I'm sure the vast majority of people on here don't, either. It's nothing but an imaginary boogeyman to blame one's failures and shortcomings in life on rather than either taking accounability or as a means of deflecting from actual problems. I think the instant it's ever mentioned or evoked, the person doing so ceases to be someone with credability or integrity, and isn't worth listening to.

I'm also reminded earlier how I was at work and also having to look for a book in a section that triggers me a lot with social sciences, and caught a glimpse of a book called ""Men Who Hate Women."" Now, just imagine the backlash that would ensue from a book called ""Women Who Hate Men"" (and there certainly are just as many, and you need to look no further than the likes of subs like GenderCritical and FDS on here). Under this supposed patriarchy, a book with such a blatantly misandrist title wouldn't be allowed to be published or released. Books that promote such a ridiculous idealogy where this patriarchy is made the source of everything wrong in the world and society and is blamed for it all, would not be allowable under a patriarchy if it truly existed. It's a belief with holes big enough to drive multiple mack trucks through.

Just something I needed to get off my chest. I'm so fed up with this nonsense and I'm sure I'm very far from the only one here who feels this way. Nonsense like the patriarchy delusion and books with titles like ""Men Who Hate Women"" are nothing but a means of dividing both men and women, and stirring animosity between them. The fact misandrists are allowed to spread their garbage like this is one of *many* things that disproves the ""patriarchy"" being something that truly exists.

Do you also feel the patriarchy doesn't exist? I find the existence of the Easter Bunny to be far more believable and credible. Unbelievable to me how some people never outgrow such a childish mindset and victimhood mentality.",MensRights
1709262471.0,"Defamed on ""Are We Dating the Same Guy"" Group - Need help","Fellas, I need advice. My situation is not unique, but I'm feeling a little helpless and don't know where to go for advice.

Some of you will be aware of these groups - but I suppose for the benefit of the masses I'll explain. There exist these private, secretive Facebook groups, that permit only women. In these groups, women share pictures of men and generally ask ""if there's any gossip about this guy"". The general idea, I guess, is to protect women from potentially dangerous men (which, by the way, I'm all for).

I've had the misfortune of having two bad relationships in my late twenties. I wrote about one here on Reddit, and the story kinda went viral on Reddit and TikTok, incidentally. The story goes I dated this girl with whom I was woefully in love, we were living together, and she cheated on me with two guys. Many months after initially suspecting this, I caved in to my gut feeling, and read her phone messages / diary. It was kinda horrifying. Just two hours before, she'd asked me where we'd be raising kids together, and now I was being confronted with texts from some DJ from Miami saying he's going to ""finger her until she squirts on the wall, and then cum on her face"". And that was one of two.

Next relationship lasted two years. Found out after-the-fact that she had fucked another dude the night of the first date, after I dropped her back at her place, and had begged him to come meet her in the bathroom of where we were at whilst on the date. 3 months into our relationship, she cheated on me with him whilst on vacation. I dated her for two more years blissfully unaware.

I did my best to move on, but both exes seemed to have done their utmost to tarnish my name amongst their friends. I guess the sudden breakups didn't make sense to their friends, who asked why I'd ended things with them. ""Oh he's an asshole, he's emotionally abusive, etc. etc."".

It seems now I'm a regular fixture in one of these ""Are We Dating the Same Guy"" groups. I don't really know why. The first time was actually really positive, it was when I'd met a girl on a plane - and she was trying to find out who I was. She and I are on good terms - but never had the chance to develop a connection given we live in different cities. All the comments from women I'd never met were suggesting I was cheating on my wife, given the nature of the trip I was on. I'm 29 and have absolutely never been married. I laughed - it seemed to just be women gossiping, who cares.

Some of the time, the posts get no comments. That's okay too I guess.

The problem, however, friends (well, specifically one friend) of my first ex have recently started an absolute smear campaign about me. They make some valid points: I read her messages - that's true -  but then go on to say I'm controlling, or a psycho, for doing so. I did so after four months of grappling with a deep deep gut feeling, that proved to be right, so in context I'm not sure I was so bad. I regret it, but I would have regretted getting 10 years down the line with that girl, getting married and having kids: God knows I would have.

The part that worries me most though, is that adjacent to these ""okay"" points, they make absolutely extraordinary claims: that I *stalked her* after we broke up, that I was *physically threatening*, and that she's afraid to see me in the street ever again, and that I *hacked her phone*. I have never stalked an ex, and have never laid hands on a woman in my life, and don't have the technical know how to hack a phone. I was raised by a single mother, in a family of only women. It just simply isn't me. After that break up, I checked myself into therapy with a *female therapist*, and just wished never to see her again.

The reason I mention the second ex, is this: She's never really let ""us"" go. She always said, if she ever found out I was dating another girl after we broke up - that would be the thing to **break** her. After appearing four or five times on this group, I deactivated my dating app profile. This was ±6 weeks ago. And yet STILL I KEEP GETTING POSTED. So now, I'm wondering **how or why do** I keep getting posted? I'm not actively dating anymore?

Originally I developed the theory that my most recent ex was posting me - because the app I was using forbids screenshots anyway, if you screenshot other profiles, you will have your account banned, but I figured maybe they had some app or another to screenshot without getting detected. I'm still not sure though.

Fellas, I'm at a loss for what to do. I can meet people easily enough without dating apps, that's alright. I guess I'm an okay looking guy, in good shape, with hobbies and a good career etc. My concern here is more like, maybe I'm interviewing for a big position at a job, and the recruiter for the position is on this group, and she goes hang on a minute: I know this guy, he beats women! I'm concerned it might impact my living situation too (I'm on a skilled work visa where I live), if it affects my work. It's getting to the point where I'm legitimately concerned for the real world ramifications it could have on my life, beyond just dating. It's been 4-6 months of constantly having friends who are on the group messaging me, being like ""u/torakfirenze, this is crazy - look at what this girl is saying about you!"". I've felt so disheartened seeing the gossip, and moreover so absolutely helpless, sometimes I've considered finding a tall building and throwing myself off it.

I've messaged the girl who's saying all the stuff asking her to please stop, I've moved past all that drama and I'd hoped she could too. I'm worried that's just exacerbated the problem.

Where do I go from here?

1709263747.0,Australian judges call-out NSW Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for bringing baseless rape prosecutions before the courts,"A NSW District Court judge has launched a scathing critique of the NSW Office of Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) for bringing a series of baseless rape accusations before the courts, urging fellow judges to speak-out about rape and sexual assault cases run by the NSW ODPP, despite there being no reasonable prospects of a conviction. In doing so, the judge ordered that the ODPP pay the legal costs of the accused man

This judgement reflects the increasing concern amongst NSW District Court judges about the impact of the “MeToo” movement on ODPP assessment of rape case prosecutions, and the “believe all women” approach to rape accusations, and was the fifth NSW District Court judgement in less than a year, to openly criticise the NSW ODPP conduct. This judgement specifically noted that these prosecutions were often at the expense of the stress and disruption of the accused, as well as the anxiety, stress, humiliation and distress of the complainant.

Reporting of this issue, and the increasing concerns of the NSW District Court judges, has been sparse, and almost entirely published in right-of-centre news outlets (The Australian newspaper, Friday 1 March 2024). Left-of-centre news outlets, including the publicly funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC News) have not reported the concerns of the judges, but have praised the lead ODPP (not named here) for her progressive work for female victims in the NSW criminal justice system, and her push for trauma based awareness in sexual crimes prosecutions.",MensRights

1709246940.0,Stop the lies about female only oppression What is oppression? Let's investigate.,"
Oppression is malicious or unjust treatment of, or exercise of power over, a group of individuals, often in the form of governmental authority or cultural opprobrium. It is related to regimentation, class, society, and punishment. Oppression may be overt or covert, depending on how it is practiced. Oppression refers to discrimination when the injustice does not target and may not directly afflict everyone in society, but instead targets or disproportionately impacts specific groups of people.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression

I have been thinking about this word because it has been thrown around by feminists.  The truth is both sexes can be oppressed.  Not feminists in the way it has been misused.

Unless the have really have  experienced it.  They should shut up!  I am tired of the misinformation and the lies that I have heard.

As a female yes I have had shitty treatments by males.  But I wasn't completely oppressed by a group of men.  If that were true I wouldn't come out here.  I don't blame all men for my rapes or bullying.  I have also experienced bullying by women and womym feminists.

My ex-bf lived under oppression in Romania before it's fall.  If he didn't comply with his government they would throw him against a wall then shoot him.  I wanted to explain this because I am so tired of hearing it being just women only.

Even when men go to war they are held hostage and can be mistreated by another male army.  I just think it should be explained and understood the exact definition rather then to have people thinking that a person who is not suffering oppression.

Some times I think these womyan can cause other women to suffer.  I really do think if you aren't apart of their club yeah they treat you like shit.  I have experienced discrimination from womyan.   If you are one of them they aren't as nice as you may think.  Maybe I am oppressed by feminists because I love men and I think men should have rights.

I care about men not being misused or abused.  If we don't see what we are doing to each other we will never have peace.  No gender should be treated unfairly.  Even by the same gender.  

This man and his wife oppressed the whole country of Romania.  I know from my ex-bf who experienced real true oppression.  I felt a deep sadness for him being imprisoned in a country that was not fair to the people who lived there.  They know what real oppression is like.

Long story short: came up from abuse (home and school), dealt with a lot of lies, a lot of heartbreak and ostracism. Now, for once in my life I feel I am doing pretty okay. Finally managed to get an entry position as a Software Developer. A big achievement mind you given that I worked in Psychology before and I did a one year conversion master's in compsci. Still not sure how the hell I managed to do it. I missed out a lot from life to the point that I feel I am way too behind socially but I am glad that when I got the opportunity to change careers, I did it and I successfully did it too

 The interesting thing is, I joined a few groups online but get bored of them quickly. Some because it is highly ""don't say this, don't do this, etc"" and other times I just get bored simply just cause. I am still in touch with one group but that group I joined about 3 years ago or so. In real life? Mmm not so sure about joining groups because of the whole ""woke and PC"" crap. I remember once going to a convention and the interviewer and the whole thing was painfully PC like ""damn, this is not enjoyable"". Similar feeling to whenever I tried dating in the past; just feels like I am a show monkey that has to follow what is right at the time. Also, went to what I thought was a nice gig...yeah, it was fun don't get me wrong but fml, can we stop with the PC shit? We get it ""diversity"" whooray, got anything else? 

Might join a local tennis club? But shall have to see. Also, I feel I need to go to the gym again. Issue is, sure I can be active and do stuff, but that is all I ever do is be a ""human doing"" and not a ""human being"", if that makes sense.

I think that is my issue: hobbies are easy if you have money and time. Issue is, I get bored asf because it's like ""oh I am just doing this activity and not any closer to anyone. This sucks"", you know? I don't feel I am overcomplicating it or that I am not ""enjoying life"" or what have you. It's just, I feel really lost given the constant contradictory behaviour from people.

1709217873.0,"Women created & perpetuate ""toxic masculinity""","All of the norms of ""toxic masculinity"" are pretty much just adaptations over time that men as a group have made to appeal to women. Any time women tell you to ""man up"" and ""be a real man"", they are promoting it. Imagine how offensive it would be to tell women that they should be ""real women"" and, for example have a baby or clean the kitchen, or any other sexist trope. Essentially the idea of the ""real man"" is the bundle of sexist gender roles for men that women still expect of us.

What if we don't want to be your provider? What if we want you to actually put effort in to relationships to make us feel special too? What if we want to be able to do activities typically branded ""feminine""? What if we want to cry when things are hard sometimes, and get emotional support from our partner rather than just giving it to them?

Well then we're often told that we are not ""real men"", and we have to ""man up"". That's the reason these norms still exist. Unfortunately women are still very much drawn to the ""dark triad"" type of traits, according to science.

There is a real double standard when it comes to this. You can't talk about ""toxic femininity"", which is 100% a thing. It just gets blamed on ""the patriarchy"" (the catch all boogeyman when you can't make an argument). All of the toxic norms associated with masculinity are claimed to be men's fault, as well as all of the toxic norms that women perpetuate.

My area of the business is about 50:50 gender split, and managers are about 70:30 in favour of women. The only sector which is male dominated is executive level, which we all know is sort of an old boys club, they all went to the same schools etc. (more related to them being from the same social demographic than being male or female).

The Women’s Association does some cool stuff I’d really like. They’ve had professional photographers in to take headshots for work and social media profiles. Speakers on work/life balance. Career guidance. Stuff like that.

1709183668.0,Going to Therapy (as a Man),"So... What are the odds that anybody reading this a professional therapist? Or perhaps a psychology / sociology major? 

&#x200B;

I feel like the world needs more psychologists who are MRAs and understand men and work to sympathize with men. I've never met any in real life. At this point I feel like I should have. 

&#x200B;

The tragic situation for all of us is that Gender Studies PhDs are often hostile to men, and their ""field"" branches into most of the Sociology, English, and History classes of today. And even worse, all therapists are either neutral or on the same side as the Gender Studies clique. 

&#x200B;

I just went through six therapists in the last three months. Three where from my college. They where free. But then I left college and had to pay out thousands of dollars for more. I was committed to a group therapy clinic with high reviews. And the next two therapists I had where from the group therapy I experienced in that hospital, from the separate PHP and IOP programs. And then the last one was a virtual appointment setup. 

&#x200B;

Four of my therapists where woman. They all rolled their eyes at me when I talked to them. And one of the guys (from my useless college) fell asleep as I talked. And the other guy was the online one, and I could only access the internet around some other people where I was not at all secure in saying everything aloud. I also just despise virtual meetings in general, that having been 50% of my high school experience. 

&#x200B;

I guess I am 0-6 now and don't see the point in trying anymore. I feel like therapy is only effective for women. It is designed more for them anyway. 

&#x200B;

At my college, many of my female professors believed that women are intellectually superior to men. And thus men don't really belong at college at all. Our true calling, one of them said, was all the manual labor and grunt work left to the trades. As the industrial revolution slows down, the traditional farms, factories, and sweatshops aren't on the table for us anymore. She acted like she was sympathetic about that based on her assumption that men didn't deserve any other opportunity. I, on the other hand, believe that forced manual labor is slavery, especially if the force discriminates on gender or race. 

&#x200B;

Things like this my therapists understood. But they all thought I was crazy after my narrative went on past this point. 

&#x200B;

Today I ran into an arts and crafts store to use the bathroom, only to discover they had only a women's bathroom. The men's room had been converted into an ""employees only"" storage area. All of the employees where woman and the store sold all kinds of paraphernalia bearing pro-woman phrases. A very disturbing one stuck with me when I saw it: ""THE FUTURE BELONGS TO WOMEN""

&#x200B;

At college I read the work of Sally Miller Gearhart and Mary Daly so that I could understand feminism at its fundamental roots. I wrote up a conspiracy theory for my English final that Gearhart's famous essay, ""THE FUTURE -- IF THERE IS ONE -- IS FEMALE"" was drafted by her publisher, Pam McAllister, who copied large portions from a first wave feminist author, Eliza Nichols. Nichols, in turn, is a racist eugenicist who dreamed of the elimination of the black race through the death of all its men. Nichols was inspired by horse breeding, which kept stallions (males) at 10% of the horse population. I concluded my essay by pointing out that Henrich Himmler was inspired by horse breeding as well, in exactly the same ways. 

&#x200B;

My English teacher refused to accept my final. I was to either take a big fat zero on it, or chose a new topic and start over. I rewrote an entirely new final up just for her. My new one was on Aristotelian logic and AI persona bots that are programmed to defy it through fuzzy logics that appear like multiple personality disorder. This essay earned me an A+, even though I bullshitted through the entire thing, in pure spite of the aforenoted situation. This professor has no grasp of technology and her degree is useless. Thus giving me the lazy A+ she slapped upon my new paper.

&#x200B;

But anyways, the omnipresent meme (an égrégore?) that women OWN the future is an incredibly disturbing one and no therapist has even really listened to me when I talk about the things I just told you above. I am disturbed by it and it makes me horribly depressed and sad. 

&#x200B;

Then my anger issues started up when I found a group of feminists online discussing using hormone blockers on their sons. The motive was because they wish they had aborted them. For a while, I was so sick from this that I could not sleep. The Nichols / Gearhart plan is starting to come true. 

&#x200B;

Gearhart created Gender Studies and infused it with Political Lesbianism on purpose. It is a program so powerful that none of us can stop it. It cannot be rendered obsolete unless it's own adherents die, but sadly, they are alive and well, and tirelessly working on brainwashing the next generation. Daly introduced the SCUM Manifesto into these academic circles, where it still lies today. She also started the Eco-Feminist meme that ""men are (literal) trash"". She was an active supporter of Gearhart. 

&#x200B;

I did not enjoy paying money into that system, or want to continue to be part of an institution that wreaked such havoc on society. I left college for a lot of reasons, but I'd rather not get into that here. It's very complicated. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - We need more male MRA therapists in the psychotherapy line of work. My mental health has taken a deep decline because I never found one anywhere, and have given up at this point. So much money down the drain just to hit the same old conclusion that society will never change, or learn to care about men. ",MensRights

Also how society is always quick to condemn men being violent to a woman in anyway even when in self-defense and it's completely warranted. And under the VAWA, all violence against men is still counted as being against women and statistics can very easily be warped and manipulated to fit one's agenda.

Seems misandrists don't really genuinely care about women, only exploiting bad experiences women have had and using that for their disgusting agenda. It's the kind of nonsense that's the reason we have these pointless, divisive gender wars where nothing gets solved.

And even if female to male violence/abuse/rape/homicide, etc. isn't on the same scale as the other way around, so what? Ignore that it does still happen? Forget that it's often massively underreported due to societal stigma and shame? That women are just as capable of violent, heinous actions as men, against either gender? I hate how this has become a contest as to who does what to who more. Whether it's men against women or women against men or both, it's all equally bad and problematic.

1709144767.0,What is masculinity?,"Much of the dialogue about ""toxic, positive, negative, etc"" masculinity is exhausting to me since all too often the people who discuss these concepts do not seem to have a firm grasp on what definition of masculinity they are using.

One of the most common examples is the person who thinks masculinity refers to behavior alone. You see this a lot in the 'toxic/positive' camps, where the qualities and attributes tied to the male experience are shaved down only to the actions of men - and who benefits from them.

Yet this is a reductive definition of masculinity, as well as a sexist one too. I find it both amusing and depressing that the folks who continue to prattle on about 'toxic masculinity' or 'positive masculinity' act like they're such revolutionaries when they're just repackaging the same reductive stereotypes society has always held about men. Most especially: that men are only our actions, and never our experiences!

Another one that gets to me is how some people seem to think that masculinity's toxicity is inversely correlated to how many people with vaginas are supervising a group of men at a given time. Male only spaces are routinely declared toxic by default, how can this be unless women's supervision is to toxic masculinity as penicillin is to bacterial infections?

(As a side note, if women are so tired of 'man-babies' then why are they so busy defining men as in need of their constant surveillance?)

Last but not least, it never seems to fail that whenever some man is exclaimed to be the model of 'positive masculinity' it is because he's doing something for others - usually without any ostensible expectation for reward. But if we pursue that reasoning to its logical conclusion, doesn't that basically mean a man can only be an example of positive masculinity if he has built up enough surplus wealth/time/or other assets that he can be so selfless? So that means any man who is struggling is necessarily incapable of positive masculinity.

For me personally, all of this shit reeks of insincere manipulative pandering and I reject all of it. Men's rights are under threat because we have allowed masculinity to be distorted and whittled down to whatever is most useful to society, instead of what is most meaningful to us.

In my view masculinity is simply the aggregate qualities and attributes of the collective and individual male experience(s). To insist it has either intrinsic or conditional moral value is as incoherent as declaring a volcano or a whirlpool has moral value. Masculinity is a manifestation of nature, and the more we try to impose gynocentric notions of right and wrong onto it the more we lose our self respect as well as our way.",MensRights
1709137893.0,Is Misogyny Systemic?,"Misandrists often like to deflect from the subject of misogyny but claiming it either isn't real (false, it very much is), doesn't have the same harmful effects as misogyny (also false, we see the effects of it constantly) or that it supposedly isn't systemic like misogyny supposedly is. I don't think it's systemic in Western nations at least. Not saying misogyny doesn't exist but women are always getting so much in the way of aid and support, misogyny is constantly recognized and condemned and has action taken against it and look at all of the organizations and shelters that only help women. Meanwhile what do men and boys get in that regards? There's abuse shelters that even outright turn away male victims as things like domestic violence and abuse are still largely recognized to only be things affecting women. And of course how badly boys do in schools and how the courts and legal systems are infamously biased against men, and how men still have to register for the draft. And society failing to recognize that men and boys are also victims of sex crimes like rape and women commit them at much higher rates than believed or reported.

There's *vastly* more evidence to show misandry is actually very much systemic, and it's always treated as a big joke. I hate it.

**An incel is part of an online community that has negative opinions about ""women"" as a problem and advocates for bad behaviors towards them and also resents men and women who are in a relationship.**  

So this is a specific flavor of a sexist person and not a person with no girlfriend. This person can be a sexist even with a girlfriend. On the other hand, these huge percentages of men on the lookout for a girlfriend can't be all so sexist. 

If someone calls you an incel, for talking about men's rights, you should not entertain that, regardless of your relationship status. An incel is a person who hates women, neither a man looking for a girlfriend nor a person who talks for men.

>The subculture is often characterized by deep resentment, hatred, hostility, sexual objectification, misogyny, misanthropy, self-pity and self-loathing, racism, a sense of entitlement to sex, blaming of women and the sexually successful for their situation (which is often seen as predetermined due to biological determinism, evolutionary genetics or a rigged game), a sense of futility and nihilism, rape culture, and the endorsement of sexual and nonsexual violence against women and sexually active people. Incel communities have been increasingly criticized by scholars, government officials, and others for their misogyny, the endorsement and encouragement of violence, and extremism. Over time the subculture has become associated with extremism and terrorism, and since 2014 there have been multiple mass killings mostly in North America perpetrated by self-identified incels, as well as other instances of violence or attempted violence.",MensRights

1709131243.0,Romance Content is Toxic,"Women's entitlement has reached an extreme peak in recent years. There are a lot of things contributing to the insanely inflated expectations women have developed, especially dating apps. But I don't see one of the main contributors talked about much: Romance content.

As you probably know, Romance content is overwhelmingly consumed by women and created by women. It makes up about a quarter of the entire book market, and is one of the most popular genres. We hear a lot about how damaging porn is for men, but women are completely given a pass on their unrealistic expectations of ""romance"" derived from this toxic media. So many women who are currently in relationships consume this content, even though they are against their partners using porn, and it poisons their ability to appraise what a good relationship even is.

And if you think about it - what's worse: unrealistic expectations in the bedroom or unrealistic expectations for the entire relationship ?

There's usually an incredibly attractive man with high social status (money, a prince, an executive) who is somehow so interested in an average woman that he is willing to give up everything to be with her. Romance content says men should fawn over even mediocre women, be the one who tries to woo them, buy them things, do whatever the woman wants because she is such a special princess just for being a woman. Many of the tropes of Romance even propagate so called ""toxic masculinity"". For example, the bad boy who treats her like shit but is great in bed. There are other tropes, but over all it is nothing but female fantasy taken to the most extreme degrees.

As the saying goes, for women Romance is a feeling they want to experience, for men it is a bunch of work they have to do to create that feeling for their partner. We need to reject the idea that romantic love is a song and dance performed by the man to attract a woman. Women need to start trying to actually make their men feel special too. To meet him in the middle. To treat him as an actual human being rather than their personal dancing monkey that they can toss away as soon as they get bored.

Men should not tolerate women who are obsessed with Romance content. Treat it the same way women would treat you if you openly had a porn addiction. Women that consume too much of this content are damaged goods.

1.  Discrimination - he claims that there is no discrimination in schools against boys which is leading to their underachievement. This is very frustrating. As everyone knows, yes there is. Multiple studies have shown this and I’m sure many people in this sub will attest to it. Warren Farrell and CS Sommer who are both older than he is also concur that teachers who are female do in fact discriminate against boys much more than they do girls. 

2. Liberation of women - reeves claims that women’s success in  the modern world are due to the elimination of sexism which previously held them back. Also, no longer having to be dependant on men has allowed them to fully flourish. This one is also pretty laughable. It’s just the elimination of sexism ? It has nothing to do with the millions of dollars of subsidies, special programs, quotas and encouragement that has paved the road for them? Things men have never gotten. It’s funny to because he does not mention how welfare, child support and alimony still allow women to be dependent if they need to. Independence is voluntary. 

What I agree with him on..

1. Special programs just for men - he mentions how we must introduce special scholarships just for boys and men to get them into certain fields that are currently female dominated.  He explicitly states, that YES, we need scholarships JUST FOR MEN.

2. Structural issues - many People try to tackle mens issues at the individual level, rather than at a societal level - where it is most needed. With women we take the opposite stance. All of their problems must be tackled from a a societal level as they are all structural in nature- even when they aren’t.

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14616660412331330875

With partnered Heterosexual women actually experiencing higher levels of sexual satisfaction when compared to their single counterparts:

https://drlauraberman.com/new-study-married-women-have-better-sex-lives-than-single-women/

The so called ""Orgasm Gap"" might be the result of a variety of reasons, from the longer time it takes women to reach climax, to biological difficulties many women unfortunately experience(between 10% to 30% of women are basically unable to reach climax according to some scientific studies, as well as 10% of women being diagnosed with ""Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder"").

Also, some scientific research has indicated that many women are apprehensive in regards to requesting what they actually desire sexually, to the point of oftentimes even faking their orgasms and deceiving their partners about their actual levels of sexual satisfaction:

Luckily, I was able to disprove her allegations with text messages I’d saved and the case was dismissed. That wasn’t enough though.

She would act like she was scared of me when walking around the apartment complex while I was passing by, while laughing about it when we were indoors. Her friend (one of the neighbors) got in on it too. She later threatened to make even “worse” false accusations before I had enough money saved for an apartment. I left with nowhere to go.

A couple of months later I saw her around town with a maintenance person for the apartment, and learned she’d married someone for a green card (she’s a citizen).

Ex 2: Dated her for 2 months. Confided in her about my previous relationship. She starts being mentally abusive but me still confused by the last one try to understand and fix things. She starts criticizing literally every single thing I do.

The weirdest thing is towards the end of the breakup, she starts making insidious remarks about my previous relationship with details that I never shared.

She tells me a story about a guy she slept with but later changes the story to imply he took advantage of her. I watched her interact with the guy before and her attitude towards him was friendly. The alarm bells in my head went off. 

Her abuse eventually turns physical so I ask her to leave and sarcastically state that she can claim I abused her and take me to court like the other one. 

A few days later, I spot her with the same immigrants, then the same maintenance guy. I sent her a text asking about it but got no response. I then sent another text about her betraying me. Next thing I know, I get hit with a summons to appear in court for a TRO hearing. Her report states I abused her every which way possible. I sent screenshots of text messages disproving her lies and of her stating how kind and gentle of a guy I am but still got hit with a TRO. They’ve since driven past me on multiple occasions. At this point, I’m convinced 

I can’t be sure if she knew my ex all along or if the ex/maintenance guy contacted her mid-relationship but what I’m certain of is that I didn’t know her. Watching the ease with which she lied made me completely question my ability to read people. 

My advice to guys when facing false allegations, no matter how ridiculous, is to get a lawyer. There are evil and vindictive people out there who have thoroughly convinced themselves that their thoughts and actions are justified.

The race/sex swap of Liet Kynes from a wise old man to a young black woman who phones in her performance.

Chani’s speech about how men and women are equal here.

Vastly expanded roles for Irulan and Margot Fenring.

Gurney Halleck is now an incompetent joke – as pointed out by Chani as she has to teach him how to put up a tent.

It is Chani who makes Paul the messiah (“thanks to you”) with a touch of her finger.

1709025721.0,Non-Discriminatory Issues: Sexual Literacy and Relationship Health: The Male Orgasm,"I am making this post in response to a, now deleted, post claiming certain things about the wider world's discussion, or lack thereof, on the male orgasm.

On said post there seemed to be an interest in discussion of this men's issue, and maybe some misconception.

Should the mods allow this post to remain, I ask that we control our rhetoric for it, and that the conversations remain around Men's sexual literacy, health, and orgasms; preferably a bit professional as well; since the lack of these discussions do not indicate discrimination, but a lack of sexual literacy.

This is not a definitive post to find research on this topic, but only to facilitate discussions, as the complaint of the post I'm responding to was that no one talks about male orgasms.

Firstly, a short video on  the anatomy of the male reproductive system, in relation to the average orgasm. There is not much to say on this, as most of us know very well about it.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t27XL34xlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t27XL34xlo)

Secondly, The Prostate (male G spot) Orgasm

There are not many studies on this one, but there is an ample amount of anecdotes to say that it exists confidently. Many have described it as a full body sensation which may, or may not, involve ejaculation. In practice it is found as, ""prostate milking,"" or, ""prostate massage,"" both also used in treatment for certain types of inflammation of the prostate.

Here is some further information, if anyone may be comfortable, and curious; as some also find it unpleasant. Do be careful though, as there is the potential for injury.

There have been accounts of external stimulation of the prostate as well, sometimes known as the perineal massage. It is done, usually by vibration, through what is commonly known as the taint, or perineum.

[https://drrachaelinstitute.com/products/external](https://drrachaelinstitute.com/products/external)

Thirdly, the dry orgasm.

Many of us likely know this one. Also known as a, ""retrograde ejaculation,"" this can happen as a result of medical conditions related to the prostate, but it often happens randomly and there's nothing wrong with it.

For those who may have a consistent issue with it to a point that it effects mental health or reproduction.

The last one I shall be discussing (but hardly the last possible orgasm) will be what I call the Emotional Orgasm, more often called the Tantric Orgasm.

This one requires patience, communication, and often spiritualism. It has been described as an exciting, cathartic, almost high experience, though many might just call it good chemistry.

Based in eastern practices, this comes from a very different school of thought than the previously discussed orgasms, and yes, they are about sex.

It's a phrase used simply to demonize men.","Any backwards gender role about women is called ""patriarchal gender roles"" or sexism. Backwards gender roles about men are called ""toxic masculinity"". There used to be a better word for it called hypermasculinity. They don't use the phrase ""toxic femininity"" or even hyperfemininity. Why is this? Well, it's because they just want to portray men as toxic and demonize them.

Feminists go against slut shaming, but often are the first people to engage in virgin shaming. They use words like incel as an insult and often accuse people of being virgins or never attracting women as an insult, because they judge men based on how much of a chick magnet they are or how sexually active they are. They use small penis insults, including the phrase ""small dick energy"", which often tend to be used by feminists. It judges men based on how their penis size is, and they accuse men of being bad at sex as insults, because society expects men to be well-endowed, sexually active and good at sex.

Feminists also often use homophobic insults. A man says anything they perceive as anti-woman, they tell them to have sex with men as an insult. Sometimes, they even say this to lonely men, too. They even have said ""why don't incels just fuck each other?"".

They even say they want men to open up more, but then dismiss any struggles men go through, tell them they're not owed anything and that it's no one's responsibility to help them and that they need to deal with it on their own. They invalidate the male loneliness problem. They respond empathetically to women's loneliness but call lonely men a bunch of evil incels with bad personalities for merely being lonely. They don't practice what they preach.

They also reinforce stereotypes about men using women for sex, being violent and being rapists and how they all should be treated as potential rapists and thugs until proven otherwise. They believe any male domestic violence victim must be the abuser or any male spousal homicide victim must've been an abuser, because they believe men cannot be victims, certainly not at the hands of women, and that women can only be victims. They believe only women are unsafe in this world, even though most male criminals harm men, because they believe subconsciously that women must be protected and men are supposed to be self-reliant and stoic.

The phrase ""toxic masculinity"" is used to demonize men as toxic and condemn men, whereas backwards gender roles about women are discussed about women being discriminated against instead of being called ""toxic femininity"". They don't care about stopping hypermasculinity. They reinforce it but pretend to be against it just to demonize men.",MensRights

I used to have my doubts about that. Of course status matters, but I thought it was more of a biological thing. *But now, I think he's right.*

**Deep learning models reveal replicable, generalizable, and behaviourally relevant sex differences in human functional brain organization**   
[I read this study on how a trained AI was able to predict with 90%](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2310012121) accuracy, whether a brain was **male** or **female**.

It just came out a week ago and it already has [feminists throwing a hissy fit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/22/male-female-brains-different-centuries). That's how you know it's legit. [Here's a link to the full study btw.](https://www.mediafire.com/file/gtdiugzrkrnnglm/ryali-et-al-2024-deep-learning-models-reveal-replicable-generalizable-and-behaviorally-relevant-sex-differences-in.pdf/file)

**Men are motivated by achievement, women are motivated by social approval.**  
What especially fascinated me, was that significant and consistent gender differences were found in the parts of the brain that trigger rewards, among other things. This is consistent with other studies, which show that whereas men's reward centers are triggered by achievement, women's reward centers are triggered by social approval. *At our core, we are motivated by different things!*

**Men are less concerned with social norms, conformity, emotional expression...**  
And are more prone to take risks due to having a proportionally smaller prefrontal cortex. Meanwhile, women have a proportionally *much* larger one. As a result...

**Women are more aware of social norms, more concerned about social conformity...**  
And on top of that are more risk averse compared to men. They are also more emotionally expressive. This of course we knew. But did you know they can *also* **modulate** their emotions far more? This means means they can literally rationalize themselves into reducing emotional impact or even change how they feel about something if the need arises. *This is weird if you are motivated by achievement, but makes perfect sense if your goal is to gather social approval!*

**Anyway, biology is not women's main driver, contrary to what I used to think.** **It's validation.**  
Because when you take into account that women are as motivated to gain social approval as men are to achieve things, the status effect that for example dating a tall guy brings, is MUCH more significant than I initially assumed.

**Tallness is culturally immensely valued. And especially with the rise of social media, social conformity is at an all-time high.**  
Women may not be a monolith, but to say they have conformist tendencies, is putting it mildly. And given that one of women's primary sources of social approval is from how attractive her partner is, you get a self-reinforcing thing. Even *if* biology is at the root of it, women want tall men because other women want tall men, the most popular women all date tall men, which they want because other women want tall men. And so on and so forth.

**Meanwhile, short guys have** ***zero*** **positive representation.**  
Especially nowadays. Even if a short guys IS successful, he gets elevated to ""honorary tall""-status. 

**Like this:**  
*""He may be short, BUT... despite his diminutive stature.... he may not be physically tall, BUT his charisma/wealth/fame/talent etcetera make him a* ***giant***.""

**Obviously, this is because height doesn't matter.**  
And there's nothing wrong with being short. That's why we associate positive traits with tallness, even in short guys- and negative traits with shortness, even in tall guys.

**However, if you look at it from the lens of conformity and social approval- of** ***course*** **women don't want short men.**  
With the exception of high-performing, highly influential women, for many women their social value is derived from her partner. And being (seen) with short guys therefore makes women look bad. To their friends, their parents, not to mention their social rivals. Of course there's physical attraction to consider. But more importantly, short guys COST women social approval- which for a woman is as valuable as, say, professional achievement is for men. For a woman, dating a short guy is the equivalent of a low-paying job for men.

1708990468.0,"Is ""The Future Is Female"" Hate Speech?","I think it unquestionably is sexist and supremacist hate speech. I feel ""The future is male"" would be just as bad and ignorant a slogan, but whereas that one would get condemned (and rightfully so), this is for some baffling reason seen as promoting equality and inclusivity when it clearly doesn't, and is just the same as it's counterpart. It's all the worse considering the person who coined it literally advocated for genocide and reducing the world's male population to 10%. So for anyone to use or promote this slogan is not only advocating for misandry and supremacy but genocide as well. 

It's incredibly disturbing and infuriating to see a slogan like this be seen as both empowering and socially acceptable, which highly blatant double standards. It's arguably child abuse as well, I mean sending the message to boys exposed to it that they have no future and the world has no place for them? So cruel. It's no different from other supremacist slogans like ""White power"" and belongs in the same category, and yet it's seen as both acceptable and empowering. And I suspect with March's ""celebrations"" we'll be seeing it used all over. It's unbelievable when I see people attempt to justify it claiming it's to show how far women have come in society and the world, and it isn't meant to be sexist. But it very much comes off as being just that. Does women's progress have to be celebrated with such a terribly sexist and discriminatory slogan that also advocates for genocide? Seems like if anything it's much more of a stepback for their progress.

It's unquestionably hate speech and needs to be designated as such. It's the same kind of garbage as ""white power."" The fact it's seen as promoting equality and inclusivity only goes to show how misandrists don't truly care about genuine gender equality, only wanting to create more division and hate, which is their goal anyway.",MensRights

1708947619.0,Women’s involvement in child sex trafficking ,"Contrary to common stereotypes, a significant proportion of human traffickers are female. According to research: “Almost all of the youth said that they served male customers, and a majority said that they predominantly served white males between 25 and 55 years of age, with a preference for older, wealthy White males. Eleven percent of the girls and 40% of the boys said that they had served a female client, but only 13% of the boys said that they exclusively served female clients.” [1]. The same study also said that males are almost half of all sex trafficking victims: “The final sample of 249 youth was 48% female, 45% male, and 8% transgender; and the average age of entry into the market was 15.29 years.” [1].

Fourthmore, other papers say: “Worldwide, 38% of the suspected perpetrators of human trafficking are female. Women from Central Europe and East Asia are even twice as likely to be a suspect of human trafficking than men (68% versus 32%). Research by Van Dijk et al. into prostitution-related human trafficking in the Netherlands between 1997 and 2000, shows that a quarter of the perpetrators were female. A small part (14%) of this group of women were considered by the police as one of the leaders of the criminal organization. Staring reports that, in most cases, women are part of the criminal group. These figures demonstrate that the proportion of female perpetrators in human trafficking should not be underestimated. Despite these considerable numbers of female suspects, little research has been conducted into this phenomenon. Therefore, theoretical and empirical advancement in this area is nearly absent.” [2].

Some facts that are related to this: the most recent data says mothers are the majority of child abusers and murderers. [3]. We also know from other studies that female-only perpetrators of child sexual abuse is about 20.8%, and female with male perpetrators accounts for 18.3%, together that means women are involved in at least 39.1% of child sexual abuse, compared to men who encompasses 51.0%, while 9.9% are unknown. [4]. Despite societal expectations and stereotypes, these statistics show that women are not immune to committing acts of violence and abuse, including against children. So it’s not inconceivable that women could be guilty of child sex trafficking, especially given the data already presented. 

While it is true that the majority number of child abusers and murderers are women, as well as a portion of child sexual abusers and traffickers, it is crucial to avoid stereotyping and assuming that all women are capable of committing such heinous crimes. Making such assumptions would be no better than the misandrists who generalize about men. The purpose of this post was to demonstrate that women aren’t exactly innocent when it comes to sex crimes against the youth, and that these crimes aren’t exactly “male-specific” crimes as some misandrists claim.

1708888715.0,"My personal guide for Matrimonial Litigation in India - DV, 498a, Maintenance and Divorce","Ok, so its been sometime since I started helping out fellow redditors and I feel there is need of some initial guide for handling these matrimonial cases. Below was my approach and for most part this seems to be pretty much helping others. Many of my fellow redditors have had their success. Nothing what I am saying is novel often these can be seen across posts. Let this be a single place for everything.

&#x200B;

**THE PRECURSORS**

Before we dig in to how we tackle each false cases, lets us all guys do following

1A. Remember whoever puts the case needs to prove, so onus of proof is on one who files cases. Dont be in a hurry to disprove their claims. Chill out go and party.

2A. Collect basic evidences early including whatsapp chats, emails, bank statements of wife, pan and other details, PF details, working details, degree qualification details etc.

3A. Get your self physically fit, so that your brain is in solid state. Show this off to your soon to be ex wife when you go to court. It will kill them mentally. Have seen this work wonders.

4A. Chill out with your buddies and post piks on social media and irritate your wife.

5A. All matrimonial cases will have same BS allegations they cant make up new thing as they go on to each cases. If the case starts with DV essentially it will be same story same evidences everywhere. Atleast Indian law is descent in this aspect.

6A. Irritate opposite lawyer by speaking to him regularly. Their case will fall out more easily than expected. Once the opposite lawyer's client sees you speaking to her lawyer, it will do wonders!!

7A. Never loose your lawyer and your judge, be friendly, joyful. Often this is the biggest issue. We want justice like amazon delivery, which is not how law works. They have to listen to your family shit for sake of salary. Imagine their life. End of day law is still in hand of humans. So speak well, call your lawyer every hearing, visit his house with fruits meet his wife, but start with an apology for bugging him, tell him you will do any homework necessary. Believe me it does wonders!!. Always agree with what judge says and if you disagree then try to do it in funny way. For example, judge in his chambers told me ""*in your WS you have said your wife threatened to cut herself with knife why did you not take knife away, I told him just that I came to kitchen for eating while she was doing this, I ate and left, she stopped her tantrums*"". Practically judge was laughing.

&#x200B;

Now lets start : **Overall strategy is to take MONEY out of equation and take few cases to trial to reveal all evidences of your wife.**

&#x200B;

1. **DV case** \- **Nothing will happen**, neither you nor your parents need to attend. Ask your lawyer to file absentee petition and prolong the case by not filing counter (at least 9 months). By 11 months the case will reach trial stage and then kill the case with evidence if it is false or get it dismissed or let it be in coma. Now the key issue here is interim maintenance (basically they will ask you to give some monthly amount to wife). Remember in absence of prima facie (it means unless there was some documents/evidence attached with petition of DV) no interim maintenance and no protection orders.  Also if judge forces you to come or says some nonsense etc unless its your evidence, sue the judge in high court dont even hesitate. Know your rights!! Also only wife as witness without third party, DV case cant be proved because thats what law says there is need of solid evidence beyond wife's statements. So be not afraid to go to trial. They wont come anyway.

&#x200B;

2. **498a** \- Chill out in Mediation at CAW cell, they dont have any powers to arrest you and do shit. Let the FIR happen, get 41A notice. Face the police , get to know them. Infact if you didnt do anything then be friendly with them. Dont file anticipatory bail and make them roam around. Also anticipatory bails cost in lakhs. Imagine many times you would have gone to peon of a govt office to get something done, not the director. Same approach here**. Need not bribe, but be friendly and navigate.** Once charge sheet is filed game is done. Remember the judgements of Arnesh Kumar and recent supreme court making DGP's sign affidavit. If something goes wrong police is in soup. Also silly silly wear and tear in marriage life wont convict you for 498a if so half of India will be in Jail including the judge. Imagine 498a will be treated equally as pick pocketing, so essentially the gravity of offense need to be similar. Moreover since much of marriage life is within 4 walls, evidence is basically a goner. Make sure case goes to trial and forget it altogether if it is false.

&#x200B;

3. **125** \- **Finish the case ASAP by taking to trial or get it dismissed**. Essentially the procedure is similar to DV except here you will use your evidence from #2A. Always try to close it quickly or dismiss it ASAP. Here again they will attempt interim. Rather finish case finalize maintenance and forget it, let them roam around courts again, file execution and stuff to get maintenance. Often always get the case dismissed if they dont come.

&#x200B;

4. **Divorce** \- If your marriage less than year, ground of cruelty is basically a joke. Still then I have seen odd cases of cruelty where there will be insane abuses by wife and her family which is a ground. Proving cruelty in Indian courts is hell of a hard task for both men and women. In my own case, my ex told so much shit judge returned it saying the case is weak. Meanwhile I told judge to accept the petition when I was asked so that we can proceed with the bullshit. Often where there is false allegations by women,  more or less it will be same shit, he took dowry, beat me for more dowry, threw me out of house with 3 clothes and a chappal. Sometime lawyers goof up and say husband is impotent, while guy proves he can get it up and wins on grounds of mental cruelty. Sometimes, after being beaten left and right by wife who is psychotic the husband wins again. Otherwise divorce in Indian courts is hell of a time. **So essentially if cruelty with rock solid proof along the lines of Dastane vs Dasatne/ Samar Gosh vs Jaya Gosh doesnt exists its not even possible.** Lawyers know these very well except they dont open their mouth.

&#x200B;

**Quirks to be aware of**

\- Both DV and 125 you need to kill the case early if you have interim maintenances, else you will be arming your wife to fight the cases. Dont prolong both, rather take it to trial. They themselves wont come at all so get them dismissed.

\- Sometimes when interim is not paid, judge uses strategy of striking of defense, to avoid this kill the case by seeking dismissal or finish it and close it off.

\- Occasionally there are DV cases for which you can get a stay, I would not suggest it as it is costly and useless unless interim is high.

\- Lawyers of girls side are notorious for dragging the cases after interim to bleed money, so get the case dismissed or kill the case.

\- If in case DV goes to trial, dont stand for your cross examination. Rather finish your side of evidence through something called ""suggestions"" in their cross. Ask your lawyer he will know this.

\- If there are insane cases other than usual package then go on offensive, file few cases on them also, else they will try to pressure you a lot.

\- Be happy if more members are implicated in false 498a in your family. Once their cases are quashed ask them to sue the wife left right and center from their native city.

&#x200B;

**My experience till date after helping redditors**

Since sometime I have many redditors reach out to me, 90% men and 10% women. Men typically face above so this guide should help. 

Meanwhile women essentially ask directly that they want money, guy is not willing to give but ready for MCD (a) lawyer is saying to file 498a, should I file it? (b) I want that piece of shit to struggle in courts because he dumped me so I want to file 498a. Neither of which leads to fruitful outcome because once 498a is done, then its run till goal post and I have seen men to take till Supreme court once they see their parents in police station. Gone are days of settlement of money. 

For some reason women dont understand guys also have ego and sentiment. Also filing 498a is like nuking your own married life, nobody will marry you. Moreover if women can file cases, so can men equally you will also bleed money.

i hate using bumble bff, swiping and chatting with dudes is not it. trends show men are disproportionately effected by the isolation/lonliness epidemic (1 in 5 say they have no close friends). i’m 26 moved to a new city and it’s been hard to find a good group of guys like i had in college/hs. 

i’m working on a male friendship social media app that streamlines hangouts. here’s how it works:

1. create an aspiration of an activity you want to do, called sends (ex. grab a drink at x bar, play pickleball at x time)

2. publish the sends so locals in your area can see them (yik yak style but not anonymous)

3. join sends, where you’ll crowdsource  logistics / time and make group decisions easily with polls 

4. send it to meeting irl 

activities could range from meeting someone for a bar, making travel plans, organizing a viewing party, etc. use ur imagination for activities you want to do but don’t have the right person to do them with.

The story is her mother convinced her and the world that Gypsy suffered from several debilitating diseases which she did  not. It’s called Munchhausen by proxy syndrome, and  both profited as a result. The world thought she was disabled but she walked on her own accord easily. It’s clear that on this issue she is a victim. 

Clearly she suffered and when Gypsy became an adult, she had to wherewithal to contact individual and seek out some help. This is where the mess begins. She was also very close to her father ( divorced from her mother) who is very sane and stable. However she chose a stranger on the Internet for help. Someone she convinced would be her boyfriend. For all that energy she could’ve reported it the truth to her dad the media to neighbour which were generous and helpful. 
Instead she chose a boy who suffered autism and convinced him to kill her mother. That’s the only solution she could imagine. Think about that. She got eight years. He got Life. But what is worse it’s how media reacted. And the world She is now a social media celebrity.

If a woman posts, she gets flooded with advice. Men get 1 or 3 replies at best after a week or so.

&#x200B;

I did write a long text with another account about my depression, because I am at the end of my strength.

I did not consider suicide before, but now I am thinking about it. Not that I have the guts to do it right now, because my depression sucked all life out of me, but I keep thinking about it.

I lost all my friends due to kid-craze and some turned into such assholes, that I just couldn't put up with their bullshit anymore. My best friend and work-buddy got a new job recently moved far away and just stopped replying after a short time.

But my bad luck should not last forever .... I thought.

I met a woman after I had some really bad relationships that sucked my life and money out of me and I thought this time its the right thing!

But as you already expect: She did lie to me and literally ghosted me one day! No reply besides a ""fuck, leave me alone!"" (we did not have a fight, everything seemed perfect. She even dragged me to a travel-agency where we looked at options do drive away. She was so hungry and happy for me!).

&#x200B;

I tried to escape the thoughts of her, but she works near my workplace and wesee each other when my shift ends. ""see"" is the wrong word. ""ignore"" is more likely.

&#x200B;

This hurled me into a state of horrible depression! I feel endlessly hurt, sad and confused.

&#x200B;

Even worse as my first depression when I was younger. I feel no energy in me anymore, I don't know why I even bother.

I cried day and night for a month. Woke up with a gut-wrenching sadness every day.

Until I was too tired to cry.

&#x200B;

Some weeks ago I tried to seek help and get therapy, but they are all ""booked out"". I have to wait till the end of the year. wtf.

&#x200B;

So I tried to get help or at least some encouraging words on Reddit. Since there are depression helpgroups. Right? RIGHT?

But it was sobering and hurtful at times tbh.

Once Reddit stopped deleting my threads for whatever reason I got 1 or 3 replies. At best.

1708849975.0,Growing frustration - What to do?,"I'm 24 now and spent all of my life feeling like shit and looking down on me because I am a man (for context I live in Sweden which is an extremist feminist country) and always being extremely kind and considerate towards women. Recently I started going to therapy to help with my self hatred, social anxiety and inability to deal with feelings. It has helped me but also I feel like I'm starting to realise how badly I've been treated throughout the years. Especially by women, but also by men (very few men are confident - certainly not me - enough to speak up about men's rights). All my life, I have given so much to women, and gotten so little back, and I've thought it's supposed to be that way. I've taken shit because I thought I deserved it.

I would actually say that I support most of what feminism has stood for. I totally agree that there has been very much injustices towards women for several hundreds years (at least), but it has by far flipped to the other side. A problem with injustices towards men, as I see it, is that they are kind of discreet. I think that's partly derived from women's extraordinary social skills, it's almost second nature for women to manipulate social situations and particularly a male partner. I don't mean that as an insult towards women. They just got better social skills. Meanwhile men got other attributes that perhaps would e.g., favor a career as an engineer, mathematician etc. Of course not saying women can't succeed in those professions.

I don't see myself as a women hater, but my frustration is growing exponentially. I'm frustrated because it's very much not socially accepted where I live to talk about women in any negative way at all. Leading to having discussions about inequalities between the genders, simply is impossible. While it is NEVER okay to generalise women, it is ALWAYS okay to generalise men. ",MensRights
1708848838.0,Simps are the worst ,"I was engaging yesterday in 2 separate ""debates"" on the internet. Both posts were written by women, and both were about how bad men are.

The first one was about how men's issues is not important, and she doesn't care about them because it's not her problem. She was talking about how ""women didn't need men's help to be successful"", and how women lift eachother up by giving compliments, so men should compliment each other and the problem is solved. She also talked about how men should stop complaining because it's our own fault we suffer.

The second one was about how we live in a patriarchy which teaches men to abuse women.

Both posts received a lot of likes and comments like ""yas queen"" from women, but the worst part was how many ""yes ma'am"" guys were out there. I made a comment about how we should stop the gender war and not view the other gender as the enemy and simps were telling me how awful men are and how I should just listen to women.

Really, simps are men's worst enemy. Not only do they reinforce ideas pushed by misandrist women, and they invalidate our struggles, but by doing that they are making our voices be so quiet. While feminists stick together in their men-hating mission, simps just give them more power, while throwing us more under the bus. And the thing is that women don't respect simps one bit; they're just using them for their benefit, but the simps are to blind to see.",MensRights

1708847521.0,Male Mental Health from the Anthropological Perspective,"I think overall for most readers here, the broad awareness of the big picture of the male mental health epidemic is known and one can piece together from the various academic sources. However, let me review, and then we can discuss its implications.

10000 years ago long term monogamy was invented. It essentially created the seeds to civilization by providing motivational buy in to low status men: the kings got concubines but the commoners would be guaranteed one woman, so were still willing to defend and invade territory and voluntarily labor for long hours in difficult conditions under an ideology of self sacrifice for family. Mate guarding, that is patriarchical restrictions on women's movement, were instituted to ensure paternity.

Sexual revolution came along. Good that women have autonomy, certainly restrictions on movement and activity are unpleasant. However, many of the self sacrifice ideology for men stayed in place. Meanwhile, anthropological evidence, from reports of hunter gatherers and evolutionary simulations, etc. suggests that without restrictions on women's autonomy, paternity fraud (=kids mistaken who their father is) will rise to and equilibriate to about 50%. The family law no fault divorce regime is the most clear start of this trend, men are relegated to having minimal direct influence on their children and are obligated to provide for the woman above and beyond costs of children (as in, fund her recreation and her pursuit of other men). Of course other fathers' benefits under the old system will also slowly erode, that perhaps is the most clear long term likely target which of course will have ancillary effects. Obviously in these circumstances, there is no motivation for men to invest in family or even broadly to the economy. Most jobs suck in their day to day lived experience, so the optimal decision for most men is minimalism, just make enough in the gig economy to survive, and hedonic entertainment (or , if they're capable, using the system to live the life of a high mate value man, e.g. a drug dealing club promoter or PUA).

One thing that stands clear is that it's overall like a slow motion train crash. It's unclear how to entirely slow it down and stop it.

For one, there is a clear incentive in broader social ideological power structures to still push male self sacrifice for family creation, as an even greater acceleration in falling birthrates would yield an economic disaster. Broadly speaking, in every primate society, men are expendable. We're all primates, twitter is just signalling and strategic social warfare.

Two, there's no clear bad guy here, it just indicates the world has no solutions, only trade offs. As in obviously restricting women's property and sexual choices is neither possible nor just. Yet these consequences seem inevitable.

So activism in a classical sense may be less fruitful, as far as changing the narrative of the most influential think tanks, etc. There are powerful, rather biological, forces in places  that would prevent any systematic advancement of the well being of low mate value men (that is, the vast majority of men)

But as far as a more decentralized means of helping men be aware of some of the salient risks in the world, legal assistance for FRAs, dropping self sacrificing ideologies that could hurt them, etc. even if more piecemeal, is a more possible and effective endeavor.

As well as an overall support and encouragement of anti-amatonormative autonomy, as in, encouraging men to live a life of their own values and choosing, rather than to self sacrifice and work hard at a job of little personal satisfaction to support an ungrateful system.

There is literally a law preventing wage discrimination based on gender called the equal pay act of 1963. If companies could pay woman less with no repercussions you would see companies hiring only woman. Moreover, a company runs the risk of being sued into oblivion if they attempted to pay woman less.

She would hurl the cruelest insults imaginable at him and my father, unable to stand up for himself, would either remain silent or try to diffuse the situation by accepting blame. He was passive and seemed incapable of defending himself. My mother would nitpick every little thing my father did, escalating minor issues into major fights. Her anger was explosive, and she would scream nasty obscenities directed towards my father at the top of her lungs, so loud that the whole neighborhood could hear.

Her relationship with her siblings (they hate each other) further fueled her rage, which she then directed towards us under various pretexts. I clearly remember she'd throw things and hit my dad, who never fought back.I wonder what would've happened if my father retaliated. My sister and I would run to our room and lock it. She'd then kick the door multiple times trying to open it, and we were shivering inside. It was honestly terrifying. I can never forget that fear.

The constant stress, embarrassment, confusion took a toll on my mental health, leading to a massive weight gain, body image issues, and severe agoraphobia, ultimately causing me to drop out of school.

I struggled to understand why my family was trapped in this cycle of abuse, feeling completely helpless and emotionally crippled.

My father's inability to stand up for himself might have perpetuated my mother's behavior. He would stay silent and accept blame, even though the issues were often trivial. Now, whenever I hear my mother's voice rise, I instinctively feel scared and angry as a coping mechanism. Maybe my father's passive demeanor may have enabled my mother's behavior to go unchecked. I don't know?

1708790515.0,What do you think about the image the west give to Saudi Arabia?,"Hello,

I wanted to share some thoughts because I'm thinking about moving to a very different place because of personal reasons (which are probably obvious thought due to the sub I am posting to :D).

Before, I used to think that Arab countries, like Saudi Arabia, were a complete shithole. But now, after reading more about it, I see I was wrong. I know that Saudi Arabia is not perfect, especially about gay rights, but we keep being taught how women there have no rights and are always treated badly by men.

But I've learned that might not be completely true. Yes, there might be problems with how some things are reported, and women might be scared to talk about bad things that happen to them. But I've read many studies that say the situation is not as bad as we think, even a lot better than our civilized west (the studies also took unreported sexual assaults into consideration)

I went to the Saudi Arabia subreddit and saw many questions aimed at women. What I found out is that they seem to be quite happy - also the saudi subreddit seems to be safe for posting personal opinions as you can also find critiques of their prince etc.. They don't like it when people assume that everything from the West is the best. There are stories of women being able to get a divorce long before the 2000s, but we are taught that women almost have no chance for divorce. At school I was thought they could not divorce before 2019.

When we hear about a woman being treated badly, we think it's common there. But once again, the women posting there seem to be generally happy, and many are okay with their traditional roles where they prioritize their family, they are ok even with wearing the veil.

I could talk a lot more about this. I know Saudi Arabia isn't perfect. But I want to say that what we see in the Western media and what some people say is not the whole truth, a lot of times the complete opposite.

1708767576.0,College Student falsely accused of rape,"As a lawyer, it's my duty to defend the rights of all individuals, regardless of the nature of the accusation against them. I recently had a case that deeply affected me, involving a young man falsely accused of rape.

My client, let's call him Sahil, was a bright and promising college student. He had a clean record and a reputation for being a respectful and responsible young man among his classmates. However, his life was turned upside down when a classmate accused him of sexual assault.

I initially thought that the boy was lying but he had whatsapp chats and recordings which showed that the case was false. The girl played on the past consensual relationship she had with the boy and had an FIR registered against the boy.

As happens in most of the cases, Sahil's reputation was tarnished, and he faced the very real possibility of spending years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. Being a close witness to such cases, I can say that the emotional toll it took on him and his family was immeasurable. His friend circle was broken, he was left all alone. Even the parents were ashamed of the boy and thrashed him badly.

We gathered some more documentary evidence through Court and successfully got an anticipatory bail for the boy and I hope the trial and the pain ends soon providing justice to Sahil.

As I reflect on this case, I am reminded of the importance of due process and the presumption of innocence. False accusations of rape not only have the potential to destroy the lives of the accused but also undermine the credibility of genuine victims.

1708765239.0,"""Radical Feminazis"" claim that ""Sexism"", harms women's mental health, while simultaneously ignoring it's effects on men's mental health.","I am referring to the following source I stumbled upon recently:

https://web.archive.org/web/20200428093720/http://therepresentationproject.org/sexism-is-bad-for-womens-mental-health/

While such claims are obviously correct, they are also conveniently ignoring the fact that women live longer on average when compared to men, men have 3 times the suicide rate of women, comprise the majority of the unemployed, homeless and incarcerated populations in addition to 97% of all workplace fatalities, 93% of all combat victims as well as 81% of all homicide victims.

If ""Sexism"" is ""bad"" for women's mental health, then it is safe to assume it is even worse for men's mental health to be honest.

I remember a poll that was conducted a long time ago, asking women on whether they had ever experienced ""Sexism"" or sexual harassment in the workplace and a marginal percentage opted to agree on such a question.

1708756649.0,How to avoid alimony and child support.,"If you are prevented from achieving what will make you happy, because of a problematic legal precedent or societal issue, you should absolutely advocate for the necessary systemic changes. In the meantime, you should take it upon yourself to curb your risk. You will probably never be able to decrease your risk to zero. However, statistics do not take into account choices.

A lot of young people today are reluctant to get married and have children. Many young people today do not want to have sex. This is partially because of child support and alimony.

Alimony is a problem. If the lower earner initiated the divorce, the higher earner can be forced to pay monetary support to their ex-spouse, even though the higher earner never wanted the divorce.

Child support is also a problem. If a woman gets pregnant, the father wants the mother to abort and she gives birth against his wishes, the mother can take the father to court and demand child support. If the mother gives the child up for adoption, the father could get custody of the child and demand child support from the mother. This is particularly problematic with the overturn of Roe v Wade, as now a lot of states are enacting abortion bans.

What needs to be done about alimony? This is simple, abolish alimony.

What about child support? Here it gets a little more complicated. Roe v Wade should be codified to protect women’s abortion rights. Child support laws should be rewritten so that you are only forced to pay child support if you choose to be in your child’s life. Once the child is born, the mother can sign her name on the birth certificate if she wants to raise the child. The father can take the issue to court and demand custody of the child if that is what he wants. If the mother wants the father to be in the child’s life, there is no need to take the issue to court in the first place. If the father wants nothing to do with the child, he can sign some paperwork stating that. When he does this, he surrenders his right to sue for custody. If the mother would rather not be responsible for the child, she can give the child up for adoption. If the father wants the child, he is first in line for custody. However, because the mother never wanted the child in the first place, she is not responsible for child support.

Until the government makes the systemic changes that need to be made, we need to take it upon ourselves to do what we can to avoid falling victim to the issue. Here is what you need to do.

How to avoid alimony.

Get a prenuptial agreement. Make sure the agreement specifies that no alimony would be paid in the event of a divorce. Although there are no guarantees in the law, if drawn up properly so that the legal requirements of the particular state in which the agreement is signed are met, a prenuptial agreement should withstand a court challenge ( [https://www.legalnature.com/guides/how-courts-determine-the-validity-of-prenuptial-agreements](https://www.legalnature.com/guides/how-courts-determine-the-validity-of-prenuptial-agreements) ). Before you get married, talk to a lawyer and make sure that there is absolutely no way that the prenuptial agreement can be voided. 

Believe it or not, there are ways for a prenup to be voided. Talk to a lawyer and make sure none of those apply to your situation.

If the prenup would literally leave the lower earner with no way to make ends meet in the event of a divorce, there is a very good chance that the prenup will be deemed unenforceable. That said, if you are anti-alimony, you should talk about that before getting married. If you would like for both you and your spouse to keep working during the marriage, say that to your fiance. If your financial situation is such that receiving alimony is pretty much the only way that the lower earner will be able to make ends meet, include in the prenup a time limit on alimony and a stipulation that alimony should be used exclusively for basic necessities, rather than a guarantee of zero alimony. Statistics show that alimony is paid in a small minority of divorces ( https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0T61O8/#:\~:text=Unlike%20child%20support%2C%20which%20is,of%20law%20at%20Marquette%20University. ). Even when alimony is paid, it is not always paid for life. Therefore, if you and your spouse do all things right (or even most things right) you can all but guarantee that alimony will not be necessary in the event of a divorce. 

How to avoid child support.

There are two different versions of this issue, one where you never want to be responsible for a child at all ever under any circumstances and one where you might want to be a parent, but not now. With the latter it could be that it is an inconvenient time or it could be that you have not yet found the right person.

If you never want to have children, the solution is to undergo a vasectomy or tubal ligation surgery.

If you might want to be a parent someday, but that day is not today, here is where it gets a little more complicated. This is what you need to do;

First, do not have casual sex. Take the traditional approach of getting to know someone before having sex. This might be a radical stance, but I believe that anyone, who intends to have casual sex, should undergo permanent sterilisation. Here is why I believe that. Humans (especially females) naturally connect sex and love. That is primarily (though not exclusively) because we understand that sex carries with it the possibility of procreation. Everyone has this instinct, but the reason why females are particularly inclined to think this way is because they are the ones who carry the babies.

Second, discuss your opinions about reproductive rights with someone relatively early in the relationship.

Discussing politics, especially with someone who you have not known very long, can be awkward. However, it is what I would recommend. The other person may have certain values that conflict with your intended lifestyle or vice versa. If you have a gay friend and you are looking for someone who would be your date to the gay friend’s wedding, then it would pose an issue if the other person is homophobic. If you smoke marijuana, you likely would not want a partner who believes that possession of marijuana should be illegal. If you want to consent to sex without consenting to parenthood, you would likely want a lover who is in favour of your right to do that.

You do not necessarily need to have that conversation on the first date, but you definitely want to talk about it before you have sex.

Build into the discussion a little. Say something like this;

To me, it is important that a partner hold the same values as me. Some of these values (a lot of these values) are connected to politics in some way. Would you mind if I discussed some of those values to see if we are compatible? I am all about equal rights. In my view, homosexuals should be allowed to marry and adopt. Trans women should be allowed in women’s restrooms.

After having that discussion, get to the topic of reproductive rights, a slightly touchier issue.

You tell the other person that you are in favour of the right to opt out of parenthood. That means that a woman should be able to abort an unwanted pregnancy, and also if a woman chooses to remain pregnant, the man should not be financially responsible for the child if he does not want to be. You tell her that.

If you are on a date with a good woman, who supports equal rights for all, she will agree with you that it is completely unfair to let women opt out of parenthood while men are afforded no such right.

If, however, you are on a date with a feminazi who views reproductive rights as a female privilege, then she will look at you like you have 15 heads and she will scream at you about what a bad idea that is. That is the time to cut and run.

This advice is important for women too. Before you have sex with a man, talk to him about what you would do if a pregnancy resulted from the sex. If you are not ready to be a mother and you would abort, tell him that you would abort. If you are not willing to abort and do not want to have sex with him unless he would support the child, then tell him that. If he says that he disagrees with your intended course of action, do not have sex with him. If you would keep the baby in the event that you got pregnant and he says that he would want you to abort, then do not have sex with him. If you would abort in the event that you got pregnant and he says that he is anti-abortion, then do not have sex with him. If you feel that he should pay for half the cost of the abortion and he says that he is unwilling to do that, then do not have sex with him.

It is a well known fact that men think about sex more than women do. However, that does not mean that it is all a man wants from a woman. Besides, if you tell a man that your desired course of action, in the event that you were to get pregnant with his baby, differs from what he would want you to do, that is almost guaranteed to make a man stop thinking about having sex with you.

Discussing your values with someone before you have sex can be a great way to figure out if someone is narcissistic. Sadly, there are a few masters of disguise out there, but they are the exception. Most narcissists wear their pompous attitude on their sleeve, because they are proud of it.

Report being raped. You can be forced to support a child financially, even if the pregnancy resulted from rape. There have been reported instances where women have raped men, gotten themselves pregnant and sued the men for child support. There have been reported instances where male rapists have successfully sued for custody. In most cases, that I have heard of, the court ruled that the victim had to pay child support and/or share custody of the child with the rapist, because the rape was not reported in a timely manner. If you report the rape in a timely manner, that might make a difference, I am not sure what legal precedent states. Also, this increases the chances that the rapist will go to prison. Even if filing the report does not result in an arrest, filing the report has other benefits. This gives the police helpful information to use when conducting future investigations. The realisation that the police are onto them might deter them from committing a crime in the future.

It is not fair that you should have to do this. In a perfect world…

* Everyone would be able to opt out of financial responsibility to an unwanted child.
* If a woman got pregnant and chose life despite the father wanting her to abort, the financial obligation would fall on the shoulders of the person who chose to give birth.
* If a woman gave the child up for adoption and the father got custody, the mother would not have to support the child financially since she did not want the child.
* All of this would apply, even if the pregnancy resulted from consensual sex.

However, if you sit around and wait for society to change, you may be old if not dead by the time the social progress that needs to be made has been made. If you access the risk, figure out what you need to do to curb your risk and you go ahead and do what you want to do, despite society trying to prevent you from doing so, you increase the chances that the system will change positively. If you take the course of action recommended above, you will inspire others to act the same way. If others act the same way, they are likely to think with your mindset. If others think with your mindset, they will likely vote the same way that you vote and advocate for the same things that you advocate for.

1708653168.0,Sensitive Boy - Extremely underrated Japanese manga addressing male sexual abuse and issues,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6d88oq0pp8kc1.jpg?width=1453&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e3b9c25ad0a8611a2456bf55dfc135ad7ed9f6b

As a heavy consumer of Japanese anime and manga, this was the first time I've ever seen the issue of male abuse and mental health addressed in a healthy way.  

The main character is a young school-aged boy who was sexually abused by a teacher and how he wants to move onwards with the support of his friends. It addresses the myths of how ""men can't be r\*ped"" and other stereotypes associated with men, especially on young boys. 

Much of modern entertainment, especially in the west, that I have witness appears to always portray male suffering/abuse as some kind of humor, so it was really refreshing to see something that counters that kind of notion. I highly recommend giving it a read.

1708623844.0,For Anyone Feeling Lonely.,"I just commented on another post but feel like more people need to hear this.  

I'm a 34 year old guy that posted a YT video on my channel a couple of years ago about feeling lonely as I got older. I'm shocked by the amount of people that still comment on that video sharing the same problem.

It's like some crazy epidemic that no one is talking about.  
  
**So many people are feeling lonely, especially men**.  
  
It's something I've been exploring lately in my own personal development and with a coach,  
  
I'll share the discoveries that have helped me and maybe it might help you too:  
  
**1-** I realized that my **beliefs** were causing some of the problems. I **believed** making friends was harder as an adult. I **believed** that everyone already had friends. I **believed** I shouldn't feel lonely as a man.  
  
Just because we **believe** something **doesn't make it true** \- it was't really that long ago that we all believed the Earth was flat (*though some still do :/*).  
  
When I started to really question that belief and look at the evidence I realized that, **statistically, a majority of men feel lonely** and want more friends.  
  
**2 -** It is completely normal for friends to drift apart, there isn't anything wrong with me.  
  
Especially when you get into your late 20s/early 30s, a lot of people start coupling up, getting married, having kids and naturally, their priories change.  
  
I spent so long **resisting this change** and trying to hold on to old friendships.  
  
I learned that I **had to let go** to make room for new people in my life.  
  
**3 - Meeting new people can actually be quite easy**, if you go to the right places.  
  
Once I changed my beliefs, I started looking for opportunities to meet new people.  
  
Groups can really help with this.  
  
The first group I found was a men's mental health group - we get together every Monday evening and share what's going on with us, good and bad. Realizing that everyone is going through their own sh\*t is making it so much easier to relate and **connect to them.**  
  
The next group I'm going to is Brazalian Ju Jitsu, my coach said that this sport in particular has a habit of **attracting like-minded people** and it's easy to bond as you spend the whole time rolling around on the floor with them!  
  
I'm looking forward to the first session next week.  
  
You don't have to do the same groups as me, find a hobby or something that you're interested in - that could be:  
  
\- D&D  
  
\- a sport  
  
\- film club  
  
\- poker  
  
\- jam sessions  
  
\- hiking  
  
whatever floats your boat.  
  
Just go with the goal of exploring the hobby and **new connections will come naturally**.  
  
A great resource to find groups is a website called *meetup(.)com* \- you'll probably find tonnes of interesting things to do on there.  
  
**Bonus Tip -** Reach out to some old friends that you've lost contact with.  
  
I did that last year reconnected with an old friend. We live very different lives and don't have much time to get together but we see each other at least once a month to catch up, I really enjoy spending time with him.  
  
**The biggest indicator of someone's fulfillment is how connected they feel.**  
  
It's worth putting in the time to get it right.

1708615893.0,Male circumcision is a brain-dead decision.,"*I am so lucky it didn't happen to me.*

Let me preface this that I discovered frenulum stimulators. They are fucking awesome sextoys and now frenulum stimulation is my favorite way to orgasm. Yet if I got the cut, I'd have missed out on all of that.  And before you call me pathetic for having a sex toy (which only men are pathetic for, btw), I have a gf. **I just like my orgasms to be satisfying.**

# So why are we still doing it to kids?

**""Because it looks better""**  
*The dumbest arguments for it are aesthetic.*  
I don't care about innies or outies. **Especially** not those of **CHILDREN**. Or should we also give vaginal plastic surgery to toddlers? *Even* if it matters to someone, **at** **least** **wait** until people can **actually** **consent to sex.** You know, before cutting into their dicks.

**""It's just a bit of useless skin, no big deal"".**  
*Fuck you, stop lying.*  
[Frenulum stimulation is the closest thing men have to a clitoral orgasm.](https://www.thebody.com/article/comprehensive-guide-frenulum-penis)  
So if the foreskin is just some skin, the clit is just an extra nipple that doesn't even give milk.

**""I'm cut, I don't miss it"".**  
*Of course not, you never had one.* You don't miss what you never had. I never missed my grandfather, because I never met him.

***""We can't trust men to even wash themselves, so just cut it off"".***  
*Actual argument I read on some feminist sub.*  
Because feminism is about gender equality. That's why it's called FEMinism. Duh. Yet even established stereotypes disagree. When men wash, they exclusively wash their ass, armpits and dick.

However, old and disabled people of all genders can't wash themselves for sure. Following this logic, it's better to start hacking away at them too. You know, to prevent yeast and other infections.

**Believe it or not, I get it for religious reasons.**  
*If you're Jewish..*  
Then you belong to the people of Abraham and your foreskin is a ritual sacrifice to seal the flesh-covenant the old man made with God when he was 99 years old, so he would be the father of many nations. Got it. You ritually cut into a boy's penis on his 8th day on earth to brand him as part of the ""chosen people"". I don't agree with it, but, I get it, it's in the oldest part of your manual and you can't question that. You go and fulfil your flesh-pact.

*Muslims*..  
Also get it, again it's in the book and we don't doubt the book. Though, sorry but you really kinda just copied that from the Jews. Don't know how happy you should be with that. But hey, I didn't write the book, either. You're just following orders, I get it.

*Though if you're Christian..*  
You're an idiot. You are **not** part of Abraham's people, **nor** Isaac's, **nor** Ishmael's. In fact, Jesus died **specifically** so that the chosen-mechanic was no longer necessary to get to heaven. You really are just messing with **God's perfect creation**... and copying the Jews. With zero angel points to show for it.

Is it to discourage masturbation? Great, let's cut into babies so they sin less. Like *that's* not a sin. Besides, it doesn't even work. Honestly I masturbate less now my orgasms are a lot more satisfying.

1708586854.0,Children need a Father in their home.,"https://www.fixfamilycourts.com/divorce-child-custody-blog/single-mother-home-statistics/

I found this statistics in an article about school shootings.

Based on the information and statistics provided in this article, the courts should start to give custody of children to Fathers, instead of their Mothers.

Single Mother Home statistics:

„37.8% of single mothers are divorced, 41% never married, and only 6.5% are widows.

That means about half of single mothers have never been married, while almost a third are divorced. (Children born to fathers out of wedlock are considered the property of the mother. Father’s do not automatically have rights like the mothers do when they give birth. A father has to prove paternity and even then the mother is considered the custodial parent. Most of the time all the father is able to get is visitation time with the child and if the mother objects she just interferes with his parenting time and enforcement of custodial interference even though a jailable offense in most states is not enforced against a custodial parent and false allegations often can be used to thwart the efforts of the noncustodial parent to enforce. Leaving the child without the time necessary to continue the growth of the bond and support of their father.)6, 8, 10,
Single mothers are more likely to live in poverty than married couples or single fathers. (Mothers who share custody equally are able to improve their life, earn more money, and are happier. This leads to happier and more financial stability. Fewer mothers would be in poverty if they had time to improve their life, have time to update their skills, and have time for themselves and be less stressed out.)

The proportion of single-parent households in a community predicts its rate of violent crime and burglary, but the community’s poverty level does not.

The strongest predictor of whether a person will end up in prison is that they were raised by a single parent.“


Crime linked to growing up in Single Mother Homes:

„In 1996, 70% of inmates in state juvenile detention centers serving long sentences were raised by single mothers.


Correlation with Criminal Involvement

„The absence of the father increases the daughters’ vulnerability to exploitation by those outside the family. Girls from homes without fathers are 6 times more likely to become pregnant as teenagers.“


Correlation with Criminal Involvement
Research has shown that individuals who grow up in single-parent homes, especially fatherless households, are more likely to engage in criminal behavior compared to those raised in two-parent homes. Father absence has been identified as a significant risk factor for criminal activity and incarceration later in life. Several studies have highlighted the link between fatherlessness and criminal involvement.“


Impact on Brain development and Behaviour

„Children from broken homes often experience emotional distress and exhibit behavioral issues due to the absence of a stable and nurturing father figure. The role of a father in a child's life extends beyond just being a provider; it includes offering guidance, support, and a sense of security. The lack of these crucial elements during critical stages of brain development can lead to long-term consequences, affecting a child's cognitive and emotional abilities.“


Fatherless Home statistics

„63% of youth suicides are from fatherless homes.

90% of all homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes.

85% of all children who show behavior disorders come from fatherless homes.

80% of rapists with anger problems come from fatherless homes.

71% of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes.

75% of all adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers come from fatherless homes.

70% of juveniles in state-operated institutions come from fatherless homes.

85% of all youths sitting in prisons grew up in a fatherless home.“


Effects of Fatherlessness - Teenage Statistics

„Teens without involved fathers are twice as likely to drop out of school.

Girls raised in fatherless homes are more than twice as likely to become pregnant before the age of 18.

Teens from single-parent households are more likely to engage in delinquent behavior compared to those from two-parent households.

Adolescents without involved fathers are at a higher risk of experiencing emotional and psychological problems.

Teens without fathers have an increased likelihood of substance abuse and addiction.

Fatherless teenage boys are more susceptible to involvement in criminal activities.

Girls from fatherless homes are more vulnerable to being lured into exploitative situations outside the family.“

1708564182.0,The dismissal of male rape victims needs to end now.,"I need to talk about something that has deeply affected me and changed my perception of the world around us. It's about male rape victims, and the disgusting dismissive attitude society often has towards them. This issue hit home for me when a close friend, whom I'll refer to as Jimmy, confided in me about his experience of being raped by a woman.

I'll be honest; I never truly understood the extent of this problem until I saw the impact it had on someone I care about. Jimmy's experience opened my eyes to the harsh reality that men can indeed be victimized sexually by women, and that their trauma is often trivialized or outright denied.

When Jimmy tried to talk about what had happened to him, he was met with disbelief and ridicule. People couldn't fathom the idea that a woman could rape a man. They ignorantly assumed that men always desire sex and would never refuse it, completely disregarding the concept of consent.  One person callously told him that, in order for him to  physically have had sex , he must have desired it. Witnessing Jimmy's struggle to be heard and believed was eye-opening. It made me realize how deeply entrenched gender stereotypes are in our society and how they can be harmful to both men and women, perpetuating harmful notions about masculinity and femininity and contributing to the marginalization and invalidation of survivors of all genders.  the fact that male rape victims, especially those victimised by women, are so readily dismissed speaks volumes about the swelling misandry in our culture.  
 

It's time for us to change the way we think about and respond to male rape victims. We need to acknowledge that sexual assault can happen to anyone, regardless of gender. We need to provide support and validation to all survivors, regardless of the gender of their perpetrator. And we need to challenge the harmful stereotypes and attitudes that perpetuate the dismissal of male rape victims. This issue is not just about Jimmy or me; it's about creating a more compassionate and inclusive society for everyone. It's about recognizing the humanity and dignity of all survivors and standing up against the injustice and ignorance that they face. We can and must make a difference and ensure that no survivor is ever made to feel alone or invalidated again.",MensRights

I forgot the name of the book or the author, but it was about a woman's murder back in the 60s and the back summary went on about the usual violence against women, misogyny, etc. and how misogyny is something that rules our institutions. I'm not denying misogyny exists (as does misandry), but it's so tiresome to constantly hear the narrative about how it's supposedly institutionalized, which is a favorite retort of misandrists when they either deny misandry exists or claim it lacks institutional power unlike it's counterpart. Even though there's plenty of evidence to suggest misandry is very much institutionalized and misogyny isn't in Western nations and on the contrary is always given attention and activism directed against it. It's just another stupid way misandrists like to divide men and women, deflect from misandry and issues affecting men and enforce their victimhood narrative. I'm so fed up with it and I'm sure many here share these feelings. With how men and boys continue to have serious issues affecting them continue to be ignored and trivialized, how misandry is never taken seriously and how women and girls continue to constantly receive special treatment and protections and such, just how is misogyny so institutonal in the West?

The fact men still have to register for the draft, that society and governments still largely fail to recognize and condemn female on male crimes, how biased schools are against boys and how biased the courts and legal system are against men, and the entirely ridiculous notion of ""believe all women.""

1708545771.0,The Misandry Myth: An Inaccurate Stereotype About Feminists’ Attitudes Toward Men," Curious what people here think of [this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03616843231202708). The abstract:

>In six studies, we examined the accuracy and underpinnings of the damaging stereotype that feminists harbor negative attitudes toward men. In Study 1 (n = 1,664), feminist and nonfeminist women displayed similarly positive attitudes toward men. Study 2 (n = 3,892) replicated these results in non-WEIRD countries and among male participants. Study 3 (n = 198) extended them to implicit attitudes. Investigating the mechanisms underlying feminists’ actual and perceived attitudes, Studies 4 (n = 2,092) and 5 (nationally representative UK sample, n = 1,953) showed that feminists (vs. nonfeminists) perceived men as more threatening, but also more similar, to women. Participants also underestimated feminists’ warmth toward men, an error associated with hostile sexism and a misperception that feminists see men and women as dissimilar. Random-effects meta-analyses of all data (Study 6, n = 9,799) showed that feminists’ attitudes toward men were positive in absolute terms and did not differ significantly from nonfeminists'. An important comparative benchmark was established in Study 6, which showed that feminist women's attitudes toward men were no more negative than men's attitudes toward men. We term the focal stereotype the misandry myth in light of the evidence that it is false and widespread, and discuss its implications for the movement.

Some additional comments [here](https://twitter.com/datepsych/status/1722236481912385657) which seemed worth noting. To extract relevant excerpts of the paper:

Third, mediational analyses suggested that the closeness between feminists’ and nonfeminists’ attitudes toward men might be explained by two opposing forces: feminists at once perceived men as a greater threat to women (associated with less favorable evaluations), and also more similar to women (associated with more favorable evaluations; Studies 4–5).

...

>These conclusions are given some nuance by subtly different patterns for different varieties of feminist ideology. *Radical and cultural feminism were associated with reduced positivity toward men.* There is pronounced ideological and demographic heterogeneity within the feminist movement. Further research is needed to determine which of the many varieties that can be identified are associated with different overall evaluations of men, and with what consequences for our model of feminists’ attitudes.

I would consider applying to modify child custody:

> Apply for a court order
> Follow these steps to apply for a court order.

> Read guidance CB001 on making an application.

> Fill in the C100 court form. You must show you’ve attended a meeting about mediation first - except in certain cases (there’s been domestic abuse, for example).

> Send the original form and 3 copies of it to the nearest court that deals with cases involving children.

> https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/apply-for-court-order

Consider an emergency motion to change custody to prevent the abusive parent from denying access to the child. Illinois but other states are similar:

> What evidence will I need to present at an emergency child custody hearing?
> In order for an emergency custody order to be obtain one the parent making the application must present evidence and the need for emergency. A parent must typically show that the child faces “immediate harm.”  It is therefore important to note and write down the events that lead you to believe your child is in risk of harm. If you gathered this through a conversation with your child or the other parent then write this down, and collect any emails, notes or photographs which may be of assistance.

> This evidence will be useful for both the emergency custody hearing as well as any subsequent hearings if you would like to apply for full custody.

1708433227.0,The analysis of Medea - intergenerational brainwashing through undercover feminism,"I realize that I have been brainwashed by the top ""thinkers"" of our society. The place, where one would think, that there are no identity politics, just love for truth and a mission to spell it out and explain it. I mean, even a feminist philosopher is doing that, and I respect it, as they are setting out their ideas to confrontation. 

**Background**

I do have partially a classical education. I have read a lot of texts and philosophy, among others, ancient Greek tragedies and texts.

So, one of the most famous Greek tragedies of all time is Medea from Euripides.   
>!Medea ends with Medea murdering her children to get back at their father and husband Jason who betrays her. Medea flies away in a chariot sent by the gods. !<

(for those of you who have watched ""American Gods"", the ""Medea"" there is something else)

Now, something about tragedy. It was intended to bring the spectators (that included women) to a state of ""Katharsis"", i.e. to spiritual freedom of shorts, after having experienced a very complicated ethical and spiritual drama, that explored the limits of norms of the era, as well as divine interventions (which were an important part of the world understanding back then). It was considered schooling, as people were forced to think and take a stance internally. So, reading these tragedies today, we are trying to think, what were the poets trying to convey. 

This is in contrast to today's visual arts, when often the goal is to just have people laugh with simple jokes, enjoy a fantasy world, relive a historical occurrence, see action or just enjoy a love story, coming of age story etc.      


**The analysis of Medea.** 

Ever since I read about this tragedy (in school or later) I do get all sorts of possible Analyses:

* It is about the pain of a person in a foreign land (Medea was an immigrant)
* the pain of betrayal, the deepness of cheating (Jason bumped uglies with another lady)
* a metaphor about rebellion against oppression 
* Gods want women to be stronger 

in general ANYTHING other than: 

*  When women get out of their minds, they can also do horrible things.

I've basically had bad experiences my life with women. My own mother was an abusive horrible woman and I think this messed me up that I couldn't see the red flags with two different relationships. Also I had a very inappropriate experience with a grown woman when i was 13.

These experiences have given made me very uncomfortable around women which I acknowledge isn't the case with all women but when I tell people about my experience almost every time without fail "" you such an incel not.all women are like that"" or ""well yeah but now you're the real oppressor because you said something bad about women"" 

But I see all the time when a woman says she hates men because of similar experiences there is far more empathy and when people try to call her out the way people have called me out its always ""she was traumatised by men she has the right you bigot""

1708426223.0,Bobbiting & Kicking Guys in the Balls are too Trivialised in Today's Society,"Penile amputation or the act of severing a penis is too triavailsed in todays society, imho.
It is an act that can lead to a lot of mental health issues and even suicide of the affected individual. Trivialisation of such a henious act can lead to an almost prevcieved acceptance of the act, and so more people feel it's okay to do. Leading to a higher prevalence of the act, especially among women since the lorena bobbitt case. I hate that it is so acceptable. It shouldn't be. If I was severed in that way, I'd probably commit suicide so it shouldn't be a laughing matter, and the victim should be given support, not mocked, but most times, they are especially in the media. 

They seem to always support or even applaud the perpetrator and mock and even ridicule the victim. Sometimes they even seem to laugh if the victim losses the limb (I mean in the sense of the way they write the article, i can tell by their language that they find this funny and have little empathy for the victim) this isn't funny in any sense. It can make someone lose their sense of identity and feel worthless.

There are so many cases of people having suicidal thoughts after such an event. Especially if they lose their appendage. Victims of this type of crime are made the butt of a joke, and that can make them feel worthless. I don't care what someone has done. This type of crime should be villainised. People should not feel this is an acceptable way to punish someone who has cheated on them. This line of thought will increase the acceptance of the crime. And will increase the prevalence of victims.

I honestly do not think society cares enough or even understands the weight of this crime. It is evident in the lack of harsh sentencing. This type of act has no female equivalent. So it should be looked at in isolation and be given a sentence not based on other precieved similar things. Because no precieved similar crimes come close to the extent of mental damage this crime does to a person. Nothing.

We need harsher sentencing for this crime to help deter people from doing it. Also, media outlets need to be punished for perpetuating the notion that this crime is acceptable and that the victims deserve it. No one deserves this type of crime unless they are very bad people. If someone cheats once, I'm sorry, but that does not warrant losing their penis. If a woman cheats, she can't lose anything like a penis or that would give her a similar degree of mental turmoil. A cheater can improve themselves. A person who does this likely is not capable of improving themselves if they think cheating warrants this type of crime.

I think many females can not fathom what losing a penis feels like. They don't have an equivalent appendage that can be so easily removed from them, so they can't understand the profound effect this type of crime can have on a man. Some men are also guilty of these sentiments, but I feel to a lesser extent than women. I'm not blaming women for this though, its hard to empathise and have compassion for something you can not understand. But there needs to be more emphasis placed on teaching people why this crime is so debilitating and mentally traumatic. I'm rather blaming society as a whole.

I feel that damaging someone's balls is also trivialised and made the butt of a cheap joke. 
I feel people don't care about damaging someone's testicles. But you can cause loss of one or both testicles. In some cases, the pain can cause death. It shouldn't be the butt of a joke it's boring, and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of people finding this funny. It isn't funny at all. People also shouldn't feel that hitting someone in that area is appropriate for small misdemeanours like offending someone or cheating. These acts can be addressed in a civil way. It should not be societally acceltable to potentially cause someone to become infertile just because their feelings got hurt. It's not societally acceptable to punch or kick someone in the vagina or boobs (which comparatively are more protected areas that don't have the same pain or degree of consequences if damaged/hit). So why does it seem societally acceptable to harm balls?

Right after the relationship, I experienced harassment, and I went to my university’s title 9 office for help. She was able to retaliate, and I was not taken seriously throughout the process. At the advice of an attorney, I tried to drop my case, but the University literally would not let me, so in return I submitted video recordings of how she talked to me and how she treated me in the relationship. Shortly afterwards, my university decided to let her drop the case only if I would drop mines as well. I was angry and whenever I tried to get answers I was left in the dark. It was clear discrimination, and they didn’t want to acknowledge it. Afterwards she even applied to my job and the university didn't do anything.

Lately, I’ve tried to get help and bring awareness to it, but no one cares. The organizations I went to for help just shuffled me around and the news outlets who have the power to bring attention to it decided it was not worth covering. I started my own [nonprofit](https://thebetteredmen.org) in late 2022 with the goal of promoting/building healthy relationships for men but still, not a lot of people seem to care about men's issues.

In my community, whenever I mention men's issues or men in abusive relationships a lot of people tend to try to shut down the conversation. Even people in my own family.

I’m writing this because I want to share what happened to me, encourage other men to come forward, and show you that this is a real concern. Due to how they handled it along with other things that were going on at the time, suicide seemed like a real option.

It's like society's default mode kicks in, and once that accusation is out there, it's tough to shake off, no matter what. And let's not forget, women aren't immune to this either. Sure, when they mess up, there might be consequences, but sometimes it feels like society gives them a pass or doesn't take their actions as seriously. It's like there's this double standard at play, and it's not doing anyone any favors. We've got to do better, challenge those stereotypes, and make sure everyone gets a fair shake, regardless of gender. Just wanted to get your thoughts on this from a male perceptive.

1708386730.0,Abolish Cafcass,"I am a father who has experienced firsthand the devastating failures of Cafcass. My son, an innocent child, was placed into the care of his abuser due to the biased decisions made by this organization. This is not just my story; it's a narrative shared by countless families across our nation.

Cafcass, or The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, is supposed to protect children's welfare in family court cases. However, their current system allows for bias opinions that can lead to tragic outcomes like mine. Furthermore, when additional checks are needed in cases handled by Cafcass, they often rely on local authorities or social services - entities that are already stretched thin.

It's time we disband Cafcass and redirect its funding towards social services where it can be used more effectively and impartially. We also propose recording interviews conducted during investigations for transparency purposes and having two separate individuals from different offices carry out these interviews to prevent bias formation.

According to a report from The Guardian (2018), there have been numerous complaints against Cafcass regarding their handling of child custody cases - indicating systemic issues within the organization that need urgent attention.

Our children deserve better than this failing system. They deserve justice, fairness, safety - things that should never be compromised due to biased decision-making processes or inadequate resources.

1708378795.0,How misandry kills boys - the case of Slovakia's sexist president,"Recently, a tragedy was reported in all the mainstream media in Slovakia - a 15-year-old boy took his life by jumping from the roof of his school due to bullying. In a video of the incident, a girl - probably one of his tormentors - can be heard shouting ""Jump you coward!""

As in all developed countries, men in Slovakia lag behind women in almost every measure of human development. They live shorter, get less education, suffer more from addictions and, of course, commit 80% of the suicides.

The president of Slovakia is a feminist and a candidate of the Progressive Slovakia party Zuzana Caputova. During the four years of her presidency, she has often talked about problems that disproportionately affect women, which is perfectly fine, except: despite the fact that men lag behind women in almost every measure, she has never talked about problems that disproportionately affect men. Never. Zero. Nada.

When the media discussed the tragedy of the 15 years of boy, not one mentioned the fact that 4 out of 5 teenage suicide victims are boys. Then the president Caputova took to her FB. She offered her condolences to the parents and ... Do you think she acknowledged the fact that teenage suicide has a gender dimension? Do you think she acknowledged that to save boys' lives we need to start treating it as a gender issue? No, she did not.

She did something else. **She used this very post to remind everyone that the majority of victims of violence are women and girls.** Which is not only a lie (the majority of victims of violence are men and boys), but also a shove in the back of the boy standing on the edge of the roof.

Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova is a progressive feminist and misandrist. Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova has blood on her hands, the blood of boys and men whose problems she has actively swept under the carpet for four years.

PS: [The specific FB post ](https://www.facebook.com/zcaputova/posts/pfbid07SopKzQHSbwMyHuoVbLj11k2tkqnFbXZa3XdAh3yYkjrW3sZswdz9r481PjwCC1Nl)",MensRights

We are dealt with public shame as if there is a magic way of dealing with narcissistic personality disorder types.

1708346125.0,Being a male SA victim was the precursor to my hatred of feminism.,"Yes, this is a real meme I came across on rslash2youknowwhat. I saved it months ago because I find it laughable but infuriatin. Women claim that male SA victims are just ridiculed by other men and women are the only ones who will support them. This is the reason they started treating male SA victims like martyrs because they get to use them to cannibalize other men. They get to portray a small portion of men as victims, while only portraying a tiny portion of women as predators and use it as an excuse to say ""See men make life so hard for male SA victims, we're the only ones who help them. This is the reason they kill themselves"". Furthermore, they assume any man who was SA'd will automatically be one of their ""allies"" because they believe that any man who has actually suffered like women have will be a feminist. This stems from the privileged idea. They also get to use it as a contrast to point out that men are +10x more likely to be predators than women. So they don't actually care about us because any male SA victims who they can't turn in to a feminist is useless.

I was sexually assaulted by my mother, who happens to also be a man-hating feminist I hate to this day and never plan on seeing her again. I think they pile so much pity on us because they fear their victim-invisibility status can be easily revokedif we are uncovered..........UNLESS all male victims also become man-hating feminists. Don't let this happen.

You see what I'm mad about? Being seen as an easy target to turn in to a ""feminist ally""? We are not cared for the minute we criticize the way feminism treats us. If we all want to taken seriously by men then we need to stop blaming toxic masculinity and letting the feminazis cannibalize us, is my point. There is no excuse for turning your back on the brotherhood and standing with them. I don't care how many jokes you heard. I'll happily stand with the toxic men and all of their jokes as long as it doesn't mean our experience being weaponized for the feminist agenda, it's the less of 2 evils.

1708329008.0,Small behaviour changes that matter (Part-1),"You know, in certain feminist groups and spaces, women often take strong moral stances and resort to labeling men as insensitive if they don't go out of their way to cater to their needs. They tend to overlook or completely ignore issues faced by men while expecting unwavering sympathy for their own. Those who don't comply are quickly branded as assholes.

Perhaps it's time to adopt a straightforward approach and simply state, ""We don't care,"" when women attempt to play the sympathy card and demand special treatment. The expectation that men should bend over backwards to accommodate women's needs has become excessive.

It's crucial to establish boundaries; otherwise, these women might persist in believing that it's our obligation to prioritize their problems. This attitude has led to an unjust sense of entitlement, where playing the victim card is seen as acceptable behavior.

Certainly, in our personal lives, we encounter many deserving women whom we willingly assist out of genuine kindness. That's because they understand us , our problems  and even help  us out. However, on a public platform, it's essential to assert that we have our own lives and challenges to contend with, in order to dispel the notion of a perpetual gentlemanly obligation.",MensRights

1708317866.0,Single men need to realize how honourable our lives are,"The life of a man has never been easier in the entire history. There is a reason why you have twice as many female ancestors compared to male forefathers. There is a reason why the average man died before reaching 30 years few centuries ago, and he still has a significantly lesser life expectancy compared to the average woman. There is a reason why we constitute 3/4ths of suicides. There is a reason why we are the biggest victims of homicides, among the most homeless people, do the most dangerous jobs, and are way more likely to be imprisoned. And yet we are told to shut up, stop our toxic masculinity, male fragility etc and to check our privilege.

The following reasons illustrate why our lives are way more honourable:

1. Men have historically conscripted on their own will in significant numbers for their nations. During the first world war, 2.5 million British men volunteered to fight. Similarly, for WW2, approximately about 6.3 million men volunteered to fight for not only their country, but also for the countless Jews in Europe.
2. Men are expected and have historically protected their families during various difficulties. There are various times in which they protect other's families. Take the case of  Maximilian Kolbe from poland during WW2. He died protecting his children of another prisoner.
3. Men are expected to earn more not just for themselves, but for their families. We don't have government programs for single fathers, homeless men, male students in college etc. We are just expected to take care of ourselves. Same goes for the large amount of child support and alimony which men are expected to pay. Only 3% of men receive spousal support, whereas strong independent and spineless women receive it 97% of the time.
4. Men are considered guilty until proven innocent by society, implying higher behavioural expectations. There are various cases of men getting social shame due to false allegations. Take the cases of Jasleen Kaur, Rohtak sisters, Eleanor Williams, and the recent case of Indian doctor being accused of self-pleasure in a flight.
5. In this age of so called equality, we are still expected to fulfil gender roles, whereas women get equality in all the comfortable things. Men take more than 90% of dangerous physical jobs, but no female would want equality in that. They want equality only in high-paying, comfortable jobs. And lets not get into the fact that a vast majority of women(around 70%) would refuse to date men earning less than them.
6. We are supposed to accept hatred from the feminists/leftists/woke while keeping ourselves calm and composed, further signifying societal expectations. There are various laws made to please these disgusting groups, like gender-biased rape laws, dowry laws and domestic violence laws. And lets not forget the Kangaroo courts in American universities.
7. We are expected to keep our emotions in check to give support to females in difficult times. Men who show emotion are often ridiculed, emasculated by women, who would cry fowl if the opposite happened.
8. We face stereotrypes from both sides of the political spectrum. We are expected to be providers and protectors(irrespective of our consent) by the conservatives, whereas the left sees us as expandable creatures who are guilty until proven innocent.
9. Women's problems are considered society's problems, whereas our problems are due to our inabilities. Take into account the various incentives for single mothers, women in college, and in various corporations. The problem of loneliness among men is considered due to lack of their ""social skills"" by magazines like Psychology Today. Such articles get debunked frequently, but the majority of the media and academia considers their words infallible, and hence men's issues are further sidelined.
10. We are expected to ignore things like false accusations, paternity fraud for the betterment of ""society"". This is a thing which I have personally observed both on reddit and real life. Victims of paternity fraud are shamed to take care of someone's bastard. The child is considered the primary victim by society and the government, and the man is expected to pay for the bastard so that the government can save money, funding the lavish lifestyles of unfaithful women. Similarly, victims of false accusations are sidelined in favour of fictitious females who would not believed due to such cases. This shows how little society cares about men, and we are expected to contribute more to it.

Single men need to realize that our difficult lives in modern times are the norm and not the exception. Men had difficult lives throughout the histories, and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. These difficulties are what make our lives more honourable. We are indeed the people with societal expectations, the people with daunting obligations, and the people with the most difficult responsibilities. But that one thing which we were, are and will always be, is people with the highest honour.",MensRights

They get married and follow all the traditions and protocols of a straight couple, despite the fact that 60% of marriages end in divorce. The absurdity of this is that of all possible combinations, two men just being themselves SHOULD result in the easiest pairing, but it doesn’t look to me like that is the case at all.
Additionally many queer men identify with and worship female archetypes, usually women who have overcome some sort of hardship. 
Resultantly, you have a huge number of these men who say they are feminists, even if they don’t know what being feminist means. I think it would be safe to bet that they would rage at the mention of men’s rights. But these are men who are in relationships with men.

1708277956.0,"Most people don't know that rape statistics are based on biased definitions, but I think we could help change that.","I'm very annoyed by the narrative around rape being that it's a gendered crime committed almost exclusively by men against women, and that the small percentage of men who are victims were raped by other men.  It seems like no one is aware that the evidence behind this narrative is based on definitions which essentially exclude the possibility of female perpetration.  It's a cycle where the pervasive idea that male victims are rare contributes to their much lower reporting rate, and then the inaccurate statistics are trotted out as a justification for treating rape as gender-based violence against women.  One of the most influential sexual violence researchers who has done a lot to create this situation is Mary P. Koss; I'm sure many of you are aware of her, but if not, searching her name on this sub will bring up a bunch of posts with the relevant info.  The most important thing about her is that she was an ""Expert Panel Member"" on ""Definitions of Sexual Assault"" for the CDC according to her CV, which is linked on [this page](https://publichealth.arizona.edu/directory/mary-koss).  The [definition of rape](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/FAQ.html) which the CDC uses in its National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey requires the victim to be penetrated, so a man who was forced/coerced to have sex with a woman was not ""raped"", but rather ""made to penetrate"".  As you'll see below, Koss doesn't think that it's possible for women to rape men, so it's reasonable to assume that she is at least partially responsible for the CDC's biased definition.

I was wondering, have any attempts ever been made to publicize her views and influence outside spaces like this?  She's said some indefensible things about male victims, which would make her and the University of Arizona, where she's been a professor for decades, look pretty bad if they were widely known.  For example, [here](https://soundcloud.com/889-wers/male-rape) is a link to a radio program from 2015 about male victims of rape which features an interview with Koss.  The timestamps for the snippets with her are around 6:15 to 7:40 and 8:15 to 9:45, but the whole thing is worth a listen.  In the interview Koss downplays male victims' trauma, reacts incredulously to the idea that a man could be forced to penetrate a woman against his will, and classifies a woman having sex with a man who has been drugged into unconsciousness as merely ""unwanted contact"".  I also found [this paper](https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/J_White_Revising_2007.pdf) regarding a particular survey for measuring sexual victimization which includes the following:

> We acknowledge the inappropriateness of female verbal coercion and the legitimacy of male perceptions that they have had unwanted sex. Although men may sometimes sexually penetrate women when **ambivalent about their own desires**, these acts fail to meet legal definitions of rape that are based on penetration of the body of the victim... We worked diligently to develop item wording that captured men's sense of pressure to have sex and draw their responses into an appropriate category of coercion instead of to rape items. (emphasis mine)

Saying men are ""ambivalent about their desires"" is disgusting, implying they're not *real* victims because deep down they actually always want it.  And the sneaky addition of ""verbal"" before coercion implies that women never use more aggressive tactics like drugs, threats, or physical force.  But don't worry, Koss and her co-authors worked really really hard to develop items that tossed those confused men into a lesser category of victimhood.  By the way, Koss is the source of the ""1 in 4 college women will be raped"" study, which used very broad definitions to classify as rape victims women who did not think they were raped, suffered no negative physical or emotional effects, and even subsequently entered into long-term relationships with their ""rapists"".  So according to her, women are always rape victims, even when they don't think they are, and men are never victims, even when they do.

I don't think there's any way to positively spin these statements, either for Koss, for the university that gave her a platform to spew them, or for the CDC who considers her an ""expert"".  So could we try to make people more aware of them somehow?  I'm thinking something along the lines of tweets with graphics like the one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/3i395g/this_is_how_mary_p_koss_one_of_the_most_prominent/) or a link to the radio interview which have the University of Arizona tagged.  Posts like that would be even more effective if made by men who have been sexually assaulted by women, who could rightfully point out that the University of Arizona is okay with them being defined out of existence.  Maybe current students could submit [bias reports](https://equity.arizona.edu/reporting) about Koss, or contact the school paper to see if they'll write a story about her views and work with the CDC.

Ultimately, I care more about making people aware that sexual violence studies are biased than I do about Koss herself.  But I think her comments are much more attention-grabbing than the definitions themselves, which makes them a useful way to not only spread that awareness, but also to undermine the gendered view of rape by driving home the point that the ""experts"" who tell us it's gendered are bigots with an agenda.",MensRights
1708276876.0,I think the main issue with the divide between radical feminists and men is miscommunication,"Ok hear me out here right, from what I can gather from the various subreddits I’ve been on, my observation is that MOST (around 80%) or so called feminists and MOST of anti-feminist/red pilled men really do agree with more than they disagree with each other. What I mean by this is on both sides we universally seem to just want true equality, where women aren’t tramped down by men and men aren’t tramped down by women. A vast majority of feminists these days seem to have a thwarted view of red pilled men as they automatically jump to things like assuming that a guy wants to “control women” and “make her be his servant” when in reality most red pilled guys just want to not be demonized by society and told they’re inherently bad, along with being invisible. 

From what I’ve seen, most modern day feminists ARENT the radical men hating ones that usually get brought up here, these women are far and few in between. In fact I think the REAL problem lies in the mass brainwashing that has done by the media to trick women into viewing redpilled men as something far worse than they’d actually are. Most arguments between feminists and men online start out with the man talking about just wanting not to be demonised and women automatically jump to the conclusion that he’s an incel. The reason they think this because the vast majority of feminists are still under the impression that feminism is how it is back in the 1970s when it as about true equality, and so their thought process goes something like this: “feminism is about women wanting to be equal, if a man says anything bad about feminism then he just wants to manipulate and turn women into slaves”. 

TLDR; So basically to sum it all up I don’t think the problem is that most feminists actually WANT to suppress men and demonize us. I think they’re brainwashed into thinking that they’re supporting 1970s true equality feminism by our educational systems and media which paint red pilled men as violent rapey misogynists.

1708273593.0,The Women's Health Gap report is biased.,"So I recently looked at the report titled  [Closing the Women’s Health Gap: A $1 Trillion Opportunity to Improve Lives and Economies](https://www.weforum.org/publications/closing-the-women-s-health-gap-a-1-trillion-opportunity-to-improve-lives-and-economies/), and I noticed how biased it was in terms of the ""gaps"" that they chose to highlight.So I just want to go over it.One of the first claims that they make is that women spend 25% more of their lives in poor health.This might seem like a disadavantage for women,but with more context you will see that it isn't.[This](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20health%20institute/our%20insights/closing%20the%20womens%20health%20gap%20a%201%20trillion%20dollar%20opportunity%20to%20improve%20lives%20and%20economies/gifs/pub-mhiwomenhealthgap-v16-ex1-lm-timed.gif?cq=50&cpy=Center) is where they get that figure from.

As you can see according to them,men have a life expectancy of 69.8 years and live 9% of their lives in poor health.While women have a life expectancy of 74.2 years and live 12% of their lives in poor health.If you do the math this means that men live 63.5 years in good health,and women live 65.3 years in good health.This mean women have both a longer healthy life expectancy and total life expectancy.

These are two majors health disparities that they gloss over,and instead they focus on the proportion of life lived in poor health.Which is actually not a disadvantage when you consider the fact that women have a longer life expectancy.

Then they go on to claim there is a gap of 75 million DALYs(Disability-adjusted life years).They claim that this is caused by a lack of proper care for women,a lack of data,barriers to getting healthcare,and lack of effective treatment.It seems like they got this number by looking at some studies that they claim shows worse treatment outcomes,data gaps, and ineffective care for women.Then saying that this is the potential extra DALYs that can be eliminated for women.

This is based off a potential reduction of DALYs for women,but they overlook the actual gap that exists between the sexes right now.If you look at the supplementary appendix 2b(pg.4734),and supplementary appendix 2c(pg.6708) of this [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30925-9/fulltext#sec1), you can see the total number of global DALYs for men and women.

These are the numbers.

Men-1,350,000,0000

Women-1,190,000,000

So this amounts to 160 million extra DALYs for men.Yet instead of choosing to focus on this larger sex disparity in DALYs that already exists,they are instead choosing to focus on potentially reducing DALYs for women even more.

I think this is another example of the empathy gap.Men actually have worse health outcomes overall,but they are only focusing on how to reduce DALYs for women.The most important health gaps are overlooked because they are unfavorable to men.They also don't analyze how men can face barriers to getting the healthcare that they need.",MensRights

1708271618.0,"Theory on why women hate ""losers"" they ""don't want"" going overseas to meet women.","I just stumbled upon this post (Reddit recommended it to me). Unfortunately I can't post a link to it (the rules of this sub don't allow it because it's from another sub) so I'll copy/paste it. I wonder what are your thoughts on the subject. Here's the post:  

It seems pretty strange that women would be so buttmad about men they label ""losers"" and ""dusties"" whom they ""don't want"" going overseas to get women.

After all, they should be happy that those men are leaving and leaving them alone.

I think the real reason many of these women are buttmad is that they based their whole identity and social status around being superior to certain men because they were too good for those men. ""Teeheehee, I'm so hot that all these creepy loser men keep creeping on me, but I'm too good for them, teeheeheehee.""

But then, after a while, she gets older and men stop paying attention to her. And the guys she used to take pleasure in cruelly rejecting, laughing at, and labelling losers, creeps, corny, geeks, incels, etc., now don't even want her and wouldn't give her a second glance. Besides that, a small percentage of them are going overseas and sleeping with women 10 x's hotter than her. All the status that she had as being the hot chick who was lusted after by lesser men whom she could reject and laugh at has evaporated because even the men she thought weren't good enough wouldn't touch her with a 6-foot pole now.

Being rejected by men she's always thought of as lesser than her undermines her ability to maintain a sense of superiority.

Of course they'll say it is because they want to ""protect"" the poor women of the ""3rd world"" who are ""forced"" to date western men out of desperation. Of course anyone who has ever been to LatAm, SEA, or any of the usual PPB destinations knows that most of these women aren't desperately poor or starving like Ethiopian famine babies in the 80s. They don't have to date western men to avoid starving to death.

The truth is, these women couldn't care less about poor women in developing countries. They're the kind of people who spit on anyone whom they see as beneath them. If a homeless guy tried to ask them for directions, they'd call 911 and accuse him of creepy-rape. They enjoy bullying guys who are genuinely nice and inoffensive. They wear clothing made by impoverished and exploited 3rd world women in Bangladesh and treat service workers like crap. So now all of a sudden they care about women in other countries being ""exploited"" by PPB's? LOL LMAO LMFAO.

They're really buttmad that their simp harem is dwindling and they can't boost their social standing and assert their so-called ""superiority"" by laughing at and rejecting ""incels"" who are pursuing them because the men aren't pursuing them anymore.",MensRights

1708265889.0,She physically attacked me and now she is gone with the kids,"M 30 with 2 twins of 6 months old with F 29. We've broken up since 1 month ago but we still live togheter in my home. Not married but we are legally cohabitating.

This morning she got notice that I had a recording of her screaming and yelling and threating to do everything to take the kids from me so she wanted me to delete it.

She took my phone, but I quickly grabbed it back and thus came the physical altercation. As a man I'm very wary that I can never touch a woman but she was pulling my sweater and nearly chocking me. Standing in front of the door blocking it and screaming to hit her whilst trying to get back my phone. After a while I managed to get out and go to the neighbour and called the cops. He told me that he had already filed a complaint against her for harrassment (called him a pedo and that she is going to cut his genetals of)

Police came and interviewed us both but I remained at my neighbour's house. She in the meantime called my dad and hers and took off with my kids to go to her parents.

How in the world is this even possible? I know that we probably will have 2 different versions of what happend but she can just take them and I cant contact her?? She can just enter my house at will and if possible I could move out aswell for a while is what the police suggested. 

Nothing even happend with the complaint from the neighbour. She can just do whatever and i will always be questionned.

(Luckily) I can prove physical injuries and a complaint that I can use but as a man you're always fearfull even tho you did nothing wrong. She already manipulated one side of my family into thinking that I left her and the kids but this incident turned around the idea that my dad had of her.

1708263416.0,Academic career becoming increasingly unfeasible to men,"Not only are the majority of students women, but I feel now academic careers also now show more and more favouritism to women both for early careers and tenure.

I can not only speak anecdotally, but also from the numbers specifically in STEM. It may differ for other disciplines. Vast majority of promotions to full professor are female to ""close the gender gap"" where I am, a rich western European country. Our biggest national research fund has public numbers that indicate between 80% and 85% of STEM starting grants go to female PIs, which they have also marketed as a win.

I've personally been looking to start my academic career as an asst. prof after multiple top tier first-author publications, a full resume page of teaching experience, half a million in grants acquired and a research internship at big tech. Climbing all the way up from poverty I thought perhaps I would get some of that sweet fabled ""DEI"" credit for being from an actually disadvantaged background, but I am not the diversity and equity they are looking for. Instead, I am gaslighted at every turn and I started to notice a staggering trend.

**The Trend?**  
Not a SINGLE young man was hired as asst. prof right out of their PhD in my entire university. I searched for it but simply couldn't find it. No matter the background or potential, none. All of them have at least 4 years of postdoc experience, and afterwards almost none of them get tenure track. Most men leave for industry after recieving constant discouragement and lack of support. Meanwhile even in my research group, both female researchers who graduated the year before me landed tenured asst. prof posistions right after completing their doctoral exam at the same university. Both of them did the standard fare: publish 3 first authors, teach one class per semester and nothing else. I even asked my PI about this and asked for advice, and all she could tell me is to keep applying and not to give up. While I have a lot of respect for my PI, but I feel a lot of the old guard in academia simply don't care any more what happens to the young and we are left to the whims of administration and their politics. If you know your statistics you know it doesn't add up, even though this is of course purely anecdotal and not empirical proof.

I've talked to more of my peers in different countries and they also noticed the same trend. Some of my old tenured peers, both male and female, have reviewed my profile and are shocked I wasn't getting any faculty positions, even non tenure track ones. Back in their day they would straight up hire me to their lab because they know I can bring in funds and perform high class research, but now everything requires comittees and processes that have only increased bias, instead of reducing it. So the only thing that awaits me is to become a postdoc slave, uprooting my life every 2 years and then hope after half a decade I am ""granted"" a non-TT faculty position that will also end up teaching all the classes that the more fortune don't want to do.

I think this isn't for me any more, and I feel many men in academia are in the same boat. I also very much fear for the future of the academia if I see this happening in a very wealthy western European country. This isn't some corrupt small nation without any research impact. I can only ask, what will science look like in 30 years from now? Sure, the super stars and top scientists will always remain, but how many top scientists do we discourage whose name we will never know?",MensRights

I want to focus on one particular segment here: ""They were able to jump the hurdle of no longer seeing the clothes linked to their sexist and homophobic connotations, and just seeing them as another thing to slip into. And because of it, they don’t necessarily see their outfit choices as a political statement, but just an everyday outfit. Much in the same way a woman sometimes walks up to her closet and skips over her jeans for a column dress, they do it for the sartorial feeling.""

So apparently feminists believe they are entitled to decided what we are and aren't allowed to be embarrassed by. The reality is, most men hate being feminine, deal with it ok. Now here's an analogy I created that I want the women reading this to imagine:

Imagine if there was a movement of women saying they should be allowed to shit themselves in public. Imagine men were pressuring you to and women who did it were celebrated while any woman who didn't was called weak and fragile and insecure. Imagine if there were articles talking about how children should be raised in a way to not see a problem with shitting yourself in public. Imagine if you were forced to and you were in tears over the humiliation but men called you a misandrist and said you don't have the right to be embarrassed by it.

Imagine if there was an article that contained: ""They were able to jump the hurdle of no longer seeing excrement linked to their misandrist connotations, and just seeing white jeans as another place to shit. And because of it, they don’t necessarily see their shit as a political statement, but just an everyday portable toilet. Much in the same way a man sometimes walks up to his bathroom and skips over the bucket for the toilet, they do it for the convenience.""

I don't want to dress like a woman. I am not ashamed or apologetic for it. If I am a misogynist and a homophobe for it, so be it. You are not ""brave"" for it, especially if you do it for the victimhood points. If you do, then good for you.

1708191612.0,Feminists Are Completly Wrong About Tomie,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I figured I'd post it here anyways (TL;DR at the end). Recently, I re-read Tomie (A manga by Junji Ito), and looked at some of the online discussion surrounding it. It's crazy how Feminism has basically ruined/tainted so many interperations of media. I was looking through Youtube Videos/Reddit Posts, and so many of the comments (As well as the videos/posts themselves), were supporting Tomie, and interpreting the story from a Feminist lens, even tho imo, that completly misses the point of the story. The story isn't some magnifcaent groundbreaking story about Feminism. Rather, it's about a girl, who though a victim in her 1st chapter (imo), becomes a completly evil monster in the subsequent ones. She isn't meant to be a defended, well-liked, or sympathetic, in fact, she's meant to be the complete opposite, an evil monster who brainwashes men through her supernatural powers, causing them to become obssessed with and eventually kill her. A lot of people pretend like she's this victim who's meant to be sympathetic and a huge cultural commentary about Feminism, and how women are often victims of mens lusts and how men kill them for no reason, even though I don't think that's the case for 99% of reasonable men in today's society. What infuriates me the most about it, is that these people who defend Tomie, often also justify Tomie's actions in 'Boy' saying that it represents a cycle of abuse, even though it clearly is just an evil monster attempting to molest a boy, and causing him to eventually go insane and die due to that, imo at least (Even though I acknowledge there can obv be diff interpretations of this chapter/the whole story). Also, a lot these feminist Tomie defenders seem to think that what the men are doing is completly natural, and there's no supernatural element involved at all, even though the story at least heavily implies, if not explicitly states, this isn't the men's own faults. They're not 'naturally' doing this cuz of their lust, they're doing it cuz of Tomie's supernatural powers, causing them to become obssessed with her, and eventually go insane in trying to kill her. In fact, the author himself (Junji Ito) even said that the intention of Tomie wasn't as some kind of representation of women victims of violence through a Feminist lens. I forgot exactly where he said this, and I completly admit, I could be wrong about this, but I believe the intention from him was more to show that even though a female may be externally beautiful, she might be internally ugly (just like Tomie), which I honestly believe is quite true (obviously not always, & there r exceptions, but it def does happen a lot from my experience).

TL;DR: Imo, feminists who think Tomie is the victim in this story, completly miss the point, and if anything, I think the men r the true victims of the story, at least in 'Boy'.",MensRights

I was really interested in history and wanted to know how people saw things differently, and started asking about life before WW2. The word patriarchy was used alot but never defined or elaborated on and male behaviour was her focus. So much so it was her anchor point (the metric used to judge every other behaviour by, like if left handed people only ever defined and measured themselves by right handed peoples behaviour).

I incidentally have a MSc in Behavioural Evolution (from 2017 so a bit dated) and ironically could weigh in to all of her arguments about sex based relationships with good knowledge of humans and the exact animals she brought up.

Short version is she wanted to find an argument to the age old issue of 'it takes two to tango' and was trying to find any way to disagree, however her points there were also my points.

Some discussions that made her frustrated.
1.) Monogamy is a behavioural strategy to keep males around by helping to ensure their offspring is there's. It persists if the offspring find it difficult to survive without two parents.

2.) You can make marriage extremely gynocentric and still have males partake in it (to an extent). You could have a system where they loose more than half there money, get none from the women, pay alimony forever, never get the kids or see them and go to prison if they can't pay an excessive amount of child support so long as it ensures offspring. I used red back spiders to argue this as they willingly get themselves killed to have a second chance to reproduce as they can push up vital organs to survive the bite from the female after mating, then go back for seconds and then get eaten as evolutionary, those that would do so get a better chance at having children. The females are under material selection and need to stay alive to give birth to the offspring and rather than just care about the next generation, care about their grandchildren (as they have the reproductive leverage to do so). As such pick not what males she likes but what males she thinks other females will like to better ensure her sons are better lottery tickets.


3.) [Highly Insulting Theory Warning] Mallard ducks can choose who gets them pregnant by shifting their bodys (using contracting vaginas and fake vaginal canals) but rather than eliminating rapist behaviour with this method, have choosen to prefer the sometimes rapey behaviour of favoured males as it likely could cause sons who can better breed with other females down the line.

4.) All of her goals could be attained by granting equality for everyone indivially and not based on equality for two categories of people. If you were the emperor of an island and saw 80% of men working 45 hours per week and 20% working 40 hours, and 80% of women working 40 hours per week and 20% working 45 hours per week and you ensures the sexes were equally paid. You would screw over every hardworking person and motivates everyone else to do less. As such it needs to be based on indivial circumstances for each person.

5.) If the roles were reversed you would have way more feminists. If women worked and men stayed home with any kids thorughout much of history, spending only the women's money, if women were drafted, if they went to prison easier and for longer periods of time for the same crime, if men lived off women to the extent they got alot of alimony, if the retirement age was higher for them than men, if prison rape was joked about for them, etc. She couldn't disagree on that one. 

6.) In terms of the gender wage gap, if the whole western culture was more equal there would not be as much of a gap. If maternity time was the same, as the women could use all the help, retirement age was the same in every country, to prevent men bring in higher positions for longer, if there was an equal change for men to get the kids, go to prison, get off homelessness, etc.

6.) Nature's matriarchies are crueler than she thinks but can work well in large open space environments like with elephants, orca whales and such. Patriarchies in nature are never actually regnogised by evolutionary biologists worth their salt as almost all male behaviour (except seahorses and such) are either facilitated or selected for by the females like dogs have been made from wolves.

7.) Odd one to say at the time but if both genders had programmable robots that could earn a wage, we would make them do useful activities (building, hunting, protecting) work longer hours than us (we aim up with what we want) get positions of power to enable us to have that power and have us spend all their income. If you wanted it to pleasure you aswell, we would have it care about our satisfaction above its own. Women can have that and to be fair if men could get that they probably would aswell.

1708119282.0,These things have existed long before social media and dating apps.  It’s time to stop using them as a scapegoat and acknowledge the people behind them. ,"
I certainly won’t say that social media and dating apps aren’t likely exacerbating the issue, especially with how they are implemented to take advantage of our psychology.  

But when people blame all the gendered issues effecting men solely on Tinder and TikTok it drives me up a wall.  It’s like blaming beauty standards solely on Instagram.  There’s been no history of beauty standards before it?  Give me a break.

Male disposability and gendered expectations that harm men have existed long before the invention of Instagram and Bumble:  Men in relationships were forced to work themselves to death in dangerous circumstances to provide for their families, fight in wars (I.e. the White Feather), abused in relationships by their partners emotionally and physically.  Male suicide and health out comes has always been significantly worse.  The “women are wonderful” effect didn’t just magically appear in the 2000’s with the advent of Facebook.  Our cultural, and even biological, bias towards women is deeply ingrained in us.

We can argue the extent to which the internet has contributed to some of these things but I swear to god if I hear one more “Online dating is why women’s expectations of men is too high” ignoring all of human history I’m going to lose my mind.  ",MensRights

1708111842.0,False rape accusation by ex girlfriend on denial of marriage.,"So, this is the storyline, we had been in relationship since last 3 years (yes, everything was consensual, but not on paper/chat) and Yes, I had agreed to marry her ( Because I wanted to marry) and Yes, I had told her many times on call/chat (she has proof).

BUT few months back, I found that (from her chat and call recordings, got doubt from her chat with a friend and confirmed it through a call recording), that she had been in physical relationship with one of her college friend when I was out of city. I confronted this and she agreed and apologized.

I'm shattered, because I believed her and had been loyal always and now my concise doesn't allow me to forget everything what she did and marry her. I politely denied her on the above grounds that I don't want to marry her now and we can part our ways.

NOW SHE IS TOTALLY CHANGED, LIKE TOTALLY CHANGED. She used to be very polite and kind always, but now she is the mode rudest, reckless women I have ever seen.

After asking me multiple times to marry her and warning me, and I repeatedly denying her.

She finally filed a false RAPE accusation on me 376 of having intercourse on false promise of marriage.

NOTE: I don't have the proof of her having that call with her friend. BUT I HAVE the call recordings of us arguing why she did that cheating with me for that boy and indirectly she did agree to that accusation AND accepted and kept apologizing.

So, I hope my situation is clear to you guys. She has proof me saying her for marriage probably and what I have and on what ground I'm denying marrying her.

\---------------------------------

After reading all over internet, I found that the moment Police finds me, they'll arrest me in any case and usually Indian penal takes 8-10 months to even begin the court process to discuss and meanwhile, all along the case, I'll be in the Jail.

Based on the above scenario, is there any possibility of me being proven Not Guilty? If I tell the judge WHY I denied marriage which I had agreed upon earlier?

What other options do I have in life now? My whole family is traumatized by this drama now and mother has gotten ill and become very weak ever since this legal drama started due to mental stigma of their only son being stuck in this situation and losing him for years (10 yrs in Jail). They are 55+ yrs. They are ready to give all their life savings, property they have just to keep me safe.

I have not been presented to the court yet (obvious reasons, as I'll be sent to Jail directly, but will have to eventually after some time), lawyer is supposed to have some hearing within court (date is getting postponed every time, since last 4 weeks, moved to next week.. no hearing yet... YES, its wasn't a joke Tareek pe Tareek is REAL GUYS!!).

Does anyone have gone through this in their life or have seen someone else gone through this? Did they succeed in proving themself not guilty? HOW LONG IT TOOK THEM?

I am not saying what am I going through this, the most dreadful thing to me is what my parents are going through because of my mistakes and I literally can't see my aging parents going through this mental torture and that is literally killing me daily seeing them. I just can't express what they are going through.

I did told them that, I can marry her if she will not do this, but my parents aren't in favor of this and are saying that they would rather prefer to come on road instead of seeing their only child living the life forcibly with her just for them. But they aren't aware of the society, they are naive that the law will give justice to their son. They don't know how our Indian laws are all in favour of girls, irrespective of whatever false claim they put on any man, man has to bear the brunt, or at least spend a year or two in Jail until proven innocent, which is rare case and in fact most of the cases are usually false.

The girl is doing all this in ego, and she literally told me on my face last time that she will make sure to make my and my family's life hell forever. (Sorry, I don't have this on record either.)

Her words = ""I apologies for whatever I did, it was just mistake. Just like you have apologised me earlier for my previous silly mistakes, please do this last time. We can begin a new chapter. I know you are the best person I will ever have in my life and most loyal. I can't be with anyone except you""  
This used to her wording every since our argument started and I denied her, until her multiple efforts since last few months and she finally understood that this man will not give up and change his mind, so her tone and mind everything changed now to just make my life hell and take her revenge on how the hell this man can deny me.

I'm super amazed how could someone do all this despite they themselves having done the wrong thing. She is super confident in erveything, court, case, Why? Because she knows GIRLS have laws in their favour, even if they say anything false, and SHE IS HAVING FREE LAWYER FROM GOVERNMENT TO FIGHT. Whereas I have already spent lakhs just to even begin the case, haven't yet properly started.

Daman man... why Life is so unfair!!

Worst is, what my elder parents are going through.. literally not a day goes by without all three of us being in tears. My mother literally lost more than 20+ kgs weights in a month.. and I'm worried a lot about her specially because she has other complications already due to old age.

Have literally lost faith from everyone and life.

Daily having suicidal thoughts now literally, because although my parents will go through the trauma of loosing their child for few days but eventually, they'll somehow come out of it after some time, instead of their YEARS long trauma. I can't really stand this and with days passing by, my mindset is getting stronger to take this step, not sure what I'll do. Please don't tell me to stay strong in this, as that'll not help me because I know what I'm going through and also know what will eventually happened with me despite me having not done anything wrong.

Guys, Any tips? Would really want to know real life scenarios of similar case if someone has gone through this and what was your judgement and specially how long it took to get proven guilty or innocent?

1708109726.0,There are enough posts about the problems we face. Let's discuss how we can solve them or at least our future generation.,"So if you scroll this sub, you can clearly see that a lot of posts are about how much problems we men face in our day to day life and how much they're being intentionally ignored. But I've rarely seen a post regarding how we can solve not all, at least few of the most pressing problems.

I was in some other thread and a user put up a list of problems or discriminations men have gone through.

\- VAWA ( **Violence Against Women Act** )

\- Laws and legal definitions of rape both federally and in many states

\- Most states don't have default shared custody still

\- Title IX implementations

\- the Duluth model still governs treatment of domestic violence issues in most areas of the country, despite being debunked by its own developer

\- Affirmative action laws disproportionately affect men both in hiring and in education, despite the latter being dominated by women 3-to-2 or nearly so

\- Safe harbor laws disproportionately affect potential fathers who have no rights in a mother giving up children for adoption anonymously

\- Abortion rights negatively affect men who may wish to be fathers, or not wish to be fathers; or have any say at all in their future responsibilities - that choice is not shared, it is completely given to the mother, despite it being the most impactful thing in the man's life as well

\- Selective service

\- Retirement age and laws related to it, considering the much shorter lifespan for men

It doesn't matter if we can solve all these problems or not, but at least giving a try is worth it. We can start simply,

1). By electing right leaders and representatives (Not religious nutjobs or far left progressives, but ones who can see the society for what it is)

2). Making support groups among ourselves (This sub is of course has been a good suport group nevertheless). We should be able to support each other, understand each other and be kind to each other. Modern day therapy is mostly biased for women, and men should be more open among ourselves. We shouldn't ignore others' problems by saying ""men are tough"", we should provide each others advices as necessary.

3). Writing letters, making petitions and sharing these problems even among your female friends to at least acknowledge these problems.

&#x200B;

We may not be able to solve all these problems in our life time, but not only can we try, but we can guide our future generations as well.

Like not only is invalidating men’s issues becoming too commonplace, but it is also becoming literally more acceptable for women to do open mockery of anything a man goes thru



Great example: look at how we laugh at men struggling in the dating scene, instead of helping them out figure a healthy protocol to improve their dating game, we  metaphorically throw eggs at them and vilify them to the fullest 


Another example: If a man ever expresses any sort of dissatisfaction with anything life, women will usually be the very first to call him “entitled”, “whiny” or tell him straight up to man-up


Also another example: If a man ever brings up any of his past traumas or hardships, what are most people’s typical reflex responses? “Go get therapy” “go touch some grass bro”, “you don’t know what real trauma is”

Sickening 


Yes men have always been disposable 


But only in recent times have we reached this level of open contempt for their issues and thanks to feminism infiltrating most institutions, are we surprised this is happening?

She's all caught up in this super intense long-distance relationship with this dude from her hometown. Like, they're talking about the whole shebang – future plans, marriage, kids, you name it. He's legit her lifeline, calling her up every single day, being her emotional rock and all that jazz.

  
But here's where it gets wild: She used to cry over the phone with her boyfriend saying things like "" You don't trust me? What have I ever done to offend you? How can you doubt me? She used to go to the extent of crying over long periods to convince her boyfriend. And he's all apologies, trying to smooth things over. She wouldn't pick up his calls for a few days. This used to happen almost every single day. This woman would keep crying on the phone and her boyfriend would keep apologizing and pacify her. This went on for as long as I can remember. However, as soon as the call was over, she would be back to her normal self and after a couple of hours, she would be getting cozy with her friends/roommates. This used to happen almost every single day, whether her BF calls or not, but she's always getting cozy with her friends afterward.

  
Then there's this one time her **BF's bestie** crashes at her place after a party, choosing her room over the spare room, even though there's space. Kinda sus, right? But hey, I shrugged it off, thinking he just felt more comfy crashing with her.

  
Fast forward a bit, she's living with a bunch of 5 dudes and another chick, and I pop by to check in. While we're chilling, I swipe her phone to check out some memes, and bam! I see she's logged into her BF's Insta. I was not sure if she had hacked into his account or if the boyfriend was sharing his password with her. Weird, right? But I don't say squat 'cause I'm not about that drama.But, as I had the phone in my hand I received a notification from her boyfriend's bestie, As per the message, she had visited his place and he sent a picture of her earring that she had forgotten in his place. I'm just like, ""Aight, not my circus, not my monkeys.""

  
Later, I crash by her bed, and in the AM, I hear her chatting away with her roomie in her ""bathroom"". But hey, it's none of my biz, right? Live and let live.

  
Cut to the afternoon, her boyfriend called her up and said that he wanted to go on a work trip with some colleagues. He was asking for her permission to go on the trip. But, she would not let him go on the trip. She started weeping saying that he does not listen to her, he does not care about her and so on. When he was adamant about going on the trip, she blocked him on Instagram and WhatsApp she received dozed calls on her Snapchat to unblock her.

  
I feel bad for her boyfriend, but you know what they say, to each their own, Maybe I should live and let live and let people do their thing and focus on my own journey.

The Men's Rights Movement doesn't have a subreddit like askfeminist, dedicated to answering questions from people who have doubts or different views from ours.

This is not good.

The result is that Feminism looks like an open community, that crushes its enemies every time while being open to discussions (even though it's not).

You may not realize this, but from the outside, MensRights looks closed-minded, and we appear afraid to be challenged by different opinions. This is also what I thought before considering joining this subreddit.

This is why discussing men's problems is NOT enough. We need a space with the sole purpose of showing everyone that Feminism is not the answer anymore and that men face discrimination in this society.

You may think that we can achieve the same goal just by allowing everyone to post their different views here. 
But that's not the same thing: people will be discouraged to do so, because it doesn't LOOK the most appropriate place to have their opinions challenged. Looks matter.

Creating and expanding a subreddit that is and also looks open to everyone's opinions, where we can debunk the lies that many people are spreading about the problems that men face, is essential.

1708006879.0,Growing up in the American education system I was taught that men are bad. They cause all the problems and are sex fiends. All the indoctrination made me hate myself for being male.,"It wasn't until I got out that I discovered my male coworkers and some dudes at a coffee shop outside my University were great people. They didn't judge appearances, they showed up when I needed help, and they gave solid advice. 

One friend noticed how much negativity I had about being a man. He was patient and showed me things to love.

Most importantly he helped me see through the lies that women say. They tell us how they want to be treated but in reality they don't find progressive supportive men sexy.
They treat indoctrinated men like Michel Ceramic from the Barbie movie or like a gay buddy. 

I began to enjoy being a man. I embraced my sexuality and my masculine drives.

Soon, I was able to study harder, work harder, and make short films. I won awards and was on TV. I stopped being a purely leftist self hating feminist to a balanced person who is firmly in touch with unpleasant reality. 

I still support women but I'm now empathic towards males too. Most importantly, I began to like myself. ",MensRights

1707991393.0,I’m 17,"I’m 17, I graduated from my high school equivalency. When I started high school I didn’t take it seriously. I failed every class freshmen, but my school didn’t hold me back, they just enrolled me in an online class. I started legally working as soon as I turned 15. At 14 I still did small time jobs, I helped flip burgers at my state fair. When I turned 15 I started working at a hockey rink, where I still work part time at. After trying to focus on online classes for 2 years, the school gave up on me, and put me in a special program. I’d take a GED preparation class, and a trade class. I did amazing in that class, scored high on my asvab, and planned on joining the military. My grandpa bought me a truck, and I still played lacrosse for my school.
 I graduated that class in December. But now I’m at a crossroads. I wanna go on dates, can’t because I don’t have my license. I constantly try to go and get the license, but my mom cancels every chance she gets. I wanted to join national guard, but I need her to sign the papers, she refuses. I don’t have the funds to get the truck my grandpa bought for me, so it just sits at his house. 

I still play lacrosse but at a jv and been hit with the realization that I’m no good. Not worth it. I played for 2 years and no one comes to my game. I’ll come close to scoring a shot, I get excited look to the crowd, scan it, no luck to my family. After every game I watch my teammates run to the stands, and hug their family, while I just stare, pick up the field and go home. No talk to them. The team talks shit about me daily. My mom runs a fundraiser for the team and we raise thousands of dollars for the team, otherwise the team has nothing. I contemplate quiting everyday.
 
I asked my mom to take her car, go out and do stuff with friends. No. My friends wanted to go drinking for a celebration, but when I asked to have that car that night she refused. For the record, I’ve never smoked or drank before in my life, and I never plan to. The one thing I feel I have a use in my friend group, the sober one, the designated driver, I’m not given the chance.

I have no reliable way to another job, and suffer from insomnia. (self diagnosed)


Everyday I consider suicide. I never plan to do it, I just imagine how people would react, would they finally show up for me? Would they even cry, the conclusion is always that I hope they would.

It made me think about how we really do need to introduce mandatory paternity testing in hospitals. Accidental incest is a real danger and right now it's being held up because of non-consent from women who feel that it's about trust in a relationship or about who has more money to be listed as the father, etc. Paternity tests should be a standard procedure for any newborn, and any doctor that doesn't have a paternity test on file should request it in order to complete the patient's medical history.

It's not enough to simply check for incest during marriage because the rate of unmarried pregnancies makes this solution ineffective.

\----

I writing to you as a member of the Justice select committee. This letter is to inform you of shortcomings at the Human Rights Commission(HRC) prior to the HRC annual review, and to suggest questions for the Commission during the review.

The shortcomings are:

* discriminating against men and boys: *and*
* not following best practice; *and*
* not meeting it statutory obligations under the 		Human Rights Act; *and*
* failing to meet its own accountability 		recommendations.

# 1The Human Rights Commission is discriminating against men and boys

Both national and international human rights law prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sex. However the Human Rights Commission discriminates against men and boys by failing to meet best practices for addressing the human rights of men and boys, and failing to perform it functions equally for men and for women.

# 2Best Practice

In additional to basic human rights principles, best practice for addressing gender issues in human rights is established in several documents, including: the United Nations *‘Manual on Human Rights Monitoring’* 1, the United Nations *‘Integrating a Gender Perspective Into Human Rights Investigations – Guidance and Practice’’* 2, and the United Nations ‘*Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – Handbook for National Human Rights Institutions’3*

The best practices include:

* Be proactive
* Be accurate
* Be impartial
* Be gender sensitive
* Making gender visible

## 2.1Proactive

The UN ‘Manual on Human Rights Monitoring’ states

Integrating gender implies a **proactive** attitude of looking at and analysing how situations affect women, girls, men and boys differently.4

The Commission is not proactive about monitoring the human rights of men and boys. They rely on passive, gender-neutral polices to be sufficient to identify men’s human rights issues and have no explicit plan to include those issues in their reports. The Commission has been asked to explicitly include men and boys in their work and has refused to do so.

Conversely, the Commission *is* proactive about the rights of women and girls, going as far as to appoint a women’s rights commissioner, women’s rights advisors, and having regular reviews of women’s rights issues as part of CEDAW monitoring.

Following best practice for women but not for men is discrimination.

## 2.2Accurate

The UN ‘Manual on Human Rights Monitoring’ states

*The integration of a gender perspective into human rights investigations is critical to ensuring high quality analysis* ***that accurately depicts the different human rights violations, including by revealing underlying gender-based discrimination…5***

The UN’s ‘Economic Cultural and Social Rights – Handbook for National Human Rights Institutions’ states

**the process of monitoring must be thorough, accurate and impartial and must be perceived as such**”.6

Accuracy means not only getting individual facts right but providing an objective and fair assessment. Unfortunately the Commission undermines accuracy by consistently ignoring or minimising gender differences when they negatively affect men. Conversely, where gender differences negatively affect women, these issues are highlighted.

For example, in 2009 Callister7 pointed out that the commission describes a 14% differential in favour of men as large, but describes a 14% differential in favour of women as small.

## 2.3Impartial

The UN’s ‘Economic Cultural and Social Rights – Handbook for National Human Rights Institutions’, states:

“**the process of monitoring must be thorough, accurate and impartial and must be perceived as such**”8

The Human Rights Commission is not impartial regarding gender issues. They judge human rights violations directed at women and girls as worse or more significant than the same violations directed at men and boys.

For example: the Human Rights Commission treats genital cutting for girls and boys very differently. Genital cutting for girls is a serious human rights violation and religion or culture should not be considered justification for cutting girls. However, for boys, the commission believes parent’s rights to religion and culture need to be considered and balanced against the rights of the child.

It is also worth noting that there are no known cases of female genital cutting in New Zealand. Conversely, every year approximately 3000 boys have their genitals cut unnecessarily for religious and cultural reasons.

Another example: in the Commission’s UNCAT report, they argue that because women are the minority of those affected in the prison population, they need special consideration as they are often overlooked, but for family violence victims, where men are the minority and often overlooked, they reverse their position and argue that the issue should be defined by the majority of those affected. That is, they argue family violence should be considered a women’s issue, while ignoring the needs of male victims.

Best practice also includes the *perception of impartiality*. Whether the commission is impartial or not, it appears to be biased against men and boys and has done little to change this perception. Simply telling people you are not biased is not sufficient to change people’s perception. The commission needs to demonstrate they are impartial.

## 2.4Gender sensitive

The UN’s ‘Integrating A Gender Perspective Into Human Rights Investigations – Guidance and Practice’ states:

***A gender-sensitive analysis is therefore instrumental to tailoring specific and action-oriented recommendations on the responses that are needed to address human rights violations, protect victims’ rights and contribute to the prevention and non-recurrence of such violations.9***

Gender sensitivity means that monitoring and investigations are sensitive enough to identify and measure gender issues. The Human Rights Commission must have systems and polices in place that can effectively identify and measure the human rights violations of men and boys as well as women and girls. Systems should be equally sensitive to issues regardless of gender.

Unfortunately, the commission does not have systems in place that are sensitive to the human rights of men and boys, because it is not proactively monitoring the humans rights of men and boys. The Commission can’t see the issue it is not looking for.

## 2.5Make visible

The UN ‘Manual on Human Rights Monitoring’ states

“Integrating gender implies a **proactive** attitude of looking at and analysing how situations affect women, girls, men and boys differently. *It is also about making such differences visible throughout the monitoring cycle.*”10

The Human Rights Commission is not making the human rights issue of men and boys visible. The Commission often includes sections of the rights of women and girls in its reports, but never on the rights of men and boys. The commission has not even made the effort to publicly recognise International Men’s Day (November 19th) despite being asked to do as little as making a social media post for the day.

# 3Not performing statutory functions

## 3.1Monitoring Compliance

Section 5 (2) (kc) of the Human Rights Act 199311 requires the human rights commission to monitor the government's compliance with international human rights instruments.

## Compliance

For the government to be compliant with those instruments, it must ensure equal enjoyment of rights between men and women.12 This applies to all civil, political, economic, cultural and social rights. Failing to ensure equal enjoyment of rights is a violation of those rights.13Therefore, for the commission to monitor compliance, it must be monitoring equal enjoyment of rights for both women *and men*. However, the Commission is monitoring equal enjoyment of rights for women, but not for men. Equality cannot be measured by only looking at one side of the equation.

The commission has systems for monitoring women’s rights. For example regular public consultations with women and women’s groups as part of monitoring the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The commission also has a women’s rights commissioner and women’s rights advisors, and regularly informs the public about the women’s rights issues it is interested in.

The commission has no plan, system or policy to monitor men’s human rights.

In addition to not meeting the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1993, this results in the commission remaining uninformed about men’s human rights issues, leading to sub-standard advice given to the government.

For example, the Human Rights Commission’s submission for the family and sexual violence strategy consultation did not make any recommendations on behalf of male victims despite male victims having serious issues with the family violence system. In fact, the Human Rights Commission recommended more services for male *perpetrators*, while it ignored the needs of male *victims*.

Likewise, the Commission's report for UNCAT also did not report accurately on men’s rights issues. It recommended discriminating against men by putting fewer women in prison. Women already have more favourable treatment in the justice system.14 15 16For example, women are more likely to be filtered out of the justice system as every natural attrition point.17 Historically, it is men who have be most disadvantaged by the justice system,18 so advocating for better treatment for women increases this discrimination.

The Commission’s UNCAT report also recommenced using gendered language that excludes male victims of domestic violence. This creates additional barriers for male victims who need help.

## 3.2National Plan of Action

The Human Rights Act 1993 requires the Commission to develop a National Plan of Action(NPA).19 The UN has set some for the requirements for the plan20:

1. The National Plan of Action must have appropriate strategies to ensure equal enjoyment of rights between women and men21.
2. These strategies should systematically identify policies and activities to protect, respect and fulfil the equal enjoyment of rights between men and women22.

The commission does not meet these requirements because their National Plan of Action does not have any strategies for ensuring men have equal enjoyment of their rights with women. The NPA identifies women’s human rights issues, but does not identify any men’s human rights issues. This means the Commission is not meeting the requirements of the Human Rights Act.

# 4Accountability

The Human Rights Commission says it wants to be a human rights exemplar, and that it will do the things it asks others to do. One of the things it asks of others is accountability.The Human Rights Commission defines accountability as:23

1. monitoring
2. independent review & a robust complainants mechanism
3. redress

Unfortunately, the Human Rights Commission has not implemented any of these things in its own system.  For example, it has never done a review to check that it is meeting its obligations under the Human Rights Act 1993 and does not have a robust procedure to deal with complaints against the Human Rights Commission.

Although the Human Rights Commission has some accountability to the government, that is limited in its effectiveness. A government that has too much influence over the Human Rights Commission will be accused of trying to hide from human rights scrutiny and face negative political consequences. An independent accountability mechanism would allow the public to trust that the Human Rights Commission is doing a good job and not committing any human rights violations or discrimination itself.

# 5Government obligations

The Government has obligations under international human rights law to ensure equal enjoyment of rights between men and women (for example, article 3 in both CCPR and ICESCR). In addition to ensuring women have equal rights, it means ensuring men also have equal rights.

Additionally, “National human rights institutions enable States to meet their international responsibility ‘to take all appropriate action’ to ensure that international obligations are implemented at the national level”.24

If the Human Rights Commission is not providing proper monitoring and advice to the government then the government cannot meet its obligations.

Therefore, the government must ensure the Human Rights Commission is doing its job properly, by:

&#x200B;

* ending discrimination against men and boys and treating the human rights of men and boys as equally important to the rights of women and girls; *and*
* following best practice as described above; 	*and*
* meeting it statutory obligations under the Human Rights Act with regards to monitoring and the NPA; *and*
* meeting its own accountability recommendations.

# 6Suggested Questions:

&#x200B;

1. What proactive steps is the Commission taking to include the rights of men and boys in their work?
2. When will the Commission perform a review to ensure it is meeting the all of the requirements of the Human Rights Act?
3. Does the Commission support and independent audit of the Commission to ensure it is doing it job properly?

I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

I don't think Incel ideology is very productive but I don't think it is opposed for reasons people really profess.  I think they are easy targets that feed social Darwinist drive.  I think attacking ""incels"" is anti-social behavior and people who attack ""incels"" need therapy.) 

The ""incel"" is an easy target, like the nerd or special needs person in highschool. Many of them are volcels and quite openly voice that they are not pursuing women because they have standards. However, they become maligned, posthumously as ""incels"" because women and their male supporters have to have the final judgement on all things (in order to secure their social system, they must keep cognitive dissonance.)

Meanwhile, the reason ""incels"" are so attacked is that the man who can't or doesn't have sex is seen as a threat.

(a) because of bifurcated sexualization of men ie men must either be bad boys or emotional eunuchs, women are taught that it is okay to never grow up and deal with the fact that attraction MUST be a rational and not emotional/hormonal decision

(b) ""incels"" cannot be coerced to go along with a political agenda with the typical quid pro quo exchange

(c) ""incels"" are seen as having authentic, inner-directed beliefs and their lack of cynicism towards their standards is seen as a threat to egos of women and the men who debase their standards to get laid

(d) ""incels"" do not accept the present social mores of sexuality which tells us that sexual identity is one of the most central and important things to adult life. It scares people with modern sexual outlook that these people do not have ""sexual choice."" To the modern sexual outlook, to be deprived of sexual choice is a human rights violation. For some, they realized they were homosexual after they could not find a partner of opposite sex. So those with the modern sexual outlook must find ways to blame ""incels"" for their lack of choice. This is why the issue is so important to immediately bring up and shame someone for being an incel. If you have been deprived of ""sexual choice"" (ie a human right) you must be the most detestable kind of person that deserves it (so says the modern sexual outlook.)

(e) the people who attack ""incels"" are closet or open social Darwinians who believe that they must grab ahold of and outwardly profess agendas and mores that will advance their own positions. Under different circumstances they would probably be God-fearing, neighbor-fearing, fellow-parishioner fearing Christians (because that would advance their position in society) but because they were born into this century, they are ""incel""-haters. They implicitly believe (many subconsciously) that like genetics, ideas adapt (as opposed to ideas being real, in the Platonic sense, ideas are rather linguistic biases) and the only the fittest ideas survive. Therefore, the ""incel,"" earns hatred for both being a man who can neither procreate and in addition who has no sympathy culturally, who's existence cannot be justified with ""old-fashioned"", extinct ideas--ideas dominated by the triumphant modern sexual outlook ""meme."" The hatred of the ""incel"" on the social Darwinian basis is double-fold and that is the most important distinction. He is hated both in his incapacity to reproduce and for the entire associational concept map of incel ideology is deemed as the inferior, extinct, nonadaptive behavior/ideas which more left-leaning (supposedly genetically superior men) have shed and evolved from.

The issue is that ""incel"" focus only underlines that a man's worth is directly related to his reproductive capacity or his capacity to simulate the reproductive act. It shows that sexless men must be straw manned into an image of dehumanized oppressors in order to justify why there are so many sexless men today in a world where ""sexual choice"" and ""sexual freedom"" are now central to human rights discussions (people are now more ""sexually free,"" but straight white men now have less sexual choice.

1707740029.0,Let's discuss about Female rape victims and the extreme hatred and sexism towards Men and Masculinity,"
At the very first I'm totally against rape for both women and men .

The question is pretty big but please don't avoid.

I'm a guy from Bangladesh, recently I saw a video from a male feminist who talking about the psychology of rapist . He is a university teacher but I thought he is providing Pseudo Theories.
He said the psychology of rapist is not only related to ""sexual frustration"" but also social, psychology and prehistoric background.

He say that Porn is not the only culprit behind rape, but this issue is deeper .
""One of the reasons for rape is masculinity display""- the male feminist said that , he showed a research by Michael Scarce from 1997.
He said there was no patriarchy in prehistoric times so at that time women used to select men themselves for reproduction and during selections, women preferred aggressive and tough men which we call ""Alpha male"" in modern time .
In this selection procedure of women, weak men were deprived and people naturally do not like to be deprived.  So the weak males aspired to become ""Alphas"" so they created in their psychology the desire to show the power of men to women. And from that Males think that women saying ""No means Yes"" and as a result for this prehistoric times, everyone thinks women love aggressive men. He said this is the natural history of rape .

To justify that men rape women to show ""Masculinity"" he gave more 2  theories that War Rape and Revenge rape , said ""Men rape women in war to show their power"" and "" Said some rapist from India is happy to teach their victims a lesson."" (Which I personally doubt if actually true or it's a feminist propaganda).

He also referred that Gang rapists celebrates the gang rape to show that they are Alpha Male .
HE ALSO SAID ""Capitalism"" is responsible for rape because Elites sexualises women to earn money .

Now what is the answer to these inferior male haters?",MensRights

1707678167.0,My analysis of the claims of medical misogyny and andronormativity in healthcare.,"
#1. Women were routinely excluded from medical research because  of andronormativity.Which led to women being underrepresented in medical research historically.


There is this idea that prior to 1993 when the NIH created the [revitalization act](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236531/),there was wholesale and routine exclusion of women from clinical trials because researchers just wanted to focus on men. However, the reality is more complex than the simplistic narrative that women were just excluded because we don’t care about them. Now there is a grain of truth to the idea that women were excluded from clinical trials, the FDA released
[guidelines](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951003051226s&view=1up&seq=3) in 1977 recommending that women of childbearing potential are excluded from phase l and early phase ll clinical trials.The fact that these guidelines exist to some people is evidence of women’s health being neglected because they are women, but when you look at what the guidelines say,it becomes clear that the FDA’s goal was not to exclude women because they thought it wasn’t important to include them in clinical trials. 

They are instead taking a cautious approach to including women in clinical trials due to what happened with the [thalidomide scandal](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/thalidomide).They wanted to ensure another tragedy like that doesn’t happen again. This is why they only recommend not including women of childbearing potential in the early phases of clinical trials where they are trying to ensure that it is safe, and find out the appropriate dosage to use. They make sure that there is at least some evidence of this drug being safe to administer in a specific dosage before risking giving it to a woman who is pregnant or may become pregnant. Phase ll and lll of the clinical trials test both safety and effectiveness with a much larger sample of people.

The document also makes it clear that these are not mandatory requirements for continuing clinical trials or getting new drugs approved. These are recommendations, some people interpreted this guideline as most women being banned from clinical trials altogether. However, that is not what the guideline says. So part of the reason why this idea came about is because of people misinterpreting and/or misrepresenting what the guideline actually says. Usually because they get their information from secondary sources instead of looking at the actual guideline. When you look at the guideline it is clear that the FDA is not against women being included in clinical trials, or just disinterested in studying women. They tried to strike a balance between safety and inclusion.

Inaddition to this, people also believe that women were underrepresented in clinical trials due to them being routinely excluded. This perception of women being underrepresented in clinical trials is what led multiple government agencies to create national offices dedicated to women’s health. Perception is not necessarily reality though. The truth is that there is no evidence of women being underrepresented in clinical trials overall. This [study](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2001/09000/did_medical_research_routinely_exclude_women__an.20.aspx) shows that women were a slight majority of participants in clinical trials and epidemiological studies, and another [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197245600000866) also shows no evidence of women being routinely excluded from clinical trials. Some women may have been excluded in trials for certain reasons, but overall there was no pervasive bias against women that lead to them being excluded. Some people have pointed out the fact that women are underrepresented in clinical trials for certain diseases like heart disease and aids, then claimed that this is evidence of disregard for women’s health.

 However, there are actually reasonable explanations for why less women were in these trials that have nothing to do with sexism. Heart disease was thought to only really affect men for a while due to a limitation of the Framingham study were they only included people under 68 in their sample. The problem with this is that heart attacks and heart disease tends to affect women later on in life. So the study appeared to show that these cardiovascular health issues were not really a problem for women which is why they were excluded from some of the earlier trials. Another reason why women may be exclude from heart diseases trials is due to them having more comorbidities and taking more medications, because they tend to get the disease later on life when they are older and sicker. These are extra variables to take into account which makes it more difficult to study heart disease interventions in women. 

When it comes to aids, the disease was thought to only affect gay men for a while, because the first cases of the disease were in gay men. More women were included in clinical trials once it was recognized that they get the disease as well. This is all discussed in more detail in this [article](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/there-is-no-womens-health-crisis).Also, women were not even the only ones to be underrepresented in clinical trials for certain diseases. As the studies show, men were underrepresented in clinical trials on cancer, reproduction, and sex hormones, so this is obviously not a gendered issue. So overall, what we can take away from all this information is that women were not routinely excluded from clinical trials on the basis of their sex because of anti-female bias. When women were excluded there was usually a reasonable explanation for it. Some seemingly arbitrary cases of exclusion happen for both men and women.

#2. Women get worse health care treatment due to gender bias.


Another claim that gets made a lot by feminists is that there is widespread anti-female bias in health care leading to worse treatment for women. The evidence to support this claim typically comes from studies showing that women receive less of some form of medical treatment compared to men. This could be painkillers, referrals, medical procedures, etc. The mainstream media has made this claim and has cited these studies as proof that women’s pain is not taken as seriously as men’s pain. A perfect example of this can be found in this [episode of The last week tonight show with John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TATSAHJKRd8).In this episode John Oliver cites multiples studies to back up this claim, if you were to just look at this episode you might think there is widespread bias against women in health care, but if you dig deeper and do research on this topic you may come to a different conclusion. Let’s look at the studies that John Oliver cited. The first claim he made about women being less likely to be referred for knee replacements then men came from a quote in an article by The New York Times, I was not able to find the study to support this claim, because there was no reference to it listed below or in the article, so I will skip this claim.

The next claim he made regarding life-saving interventions comes from this [study](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/177/12/1513.long).This study was a prospective cohort study meaning that men and women who were admitted into the hospital were simply observed overtime to see what treatments they received. According to the study they were actually able to account for some relevant factors like comorbidities, severity of illness, and diagnosis, but there were other relevant factors that they could not account for like presentation of disease, race, type of medical insurance, patient preference, etc.The researchers acknowledges this limitation in the study and says this. 

>Our study had several limitations. Because it was observational, we were unable to establish causal relations. We also were unable to determine population prevalence rates for all ICU admission diagnoses and, thus, could not explore reasons for different admission rates among men and women for all conditions. Similarly, information was not available for all critically ill patients in all ICUs in Ontario. However, we used a broad spectrum of teaching and community hospitals and ICUs within a research network well known for its ability to capture valid and detailed information at the patient level. There may have been variables that we were unable to measure that had important effects on the reported associations.

This study cannot be used to claim that there is a bias against women in health care which leads to them getting inferior treatment, but it is being presented as if it can. The next [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00100.x) is about gender disparities in receiving painkillers for abdominal pain. The study found that women received less opioid analgesics then men. This study also suffers from some limitations that prevents the researchers from making a definitive claim of gender bias. This is why they use more conservative language by claiming that gender bias is a possible explanation for the disparities.

>Gender bias is a possible explanation for oligoanalgesia in women who present to the ED with acute abdominal pain. Standardized protocols for analgesic administration may ameliorate this discrepancy.

One major issue with this study is that they did not record follow-up pain scores which may have influenced analgesia administration. They were also unable to control for the severity of illness, and comorbidities. Another issues is that they could not determine whether or not patients refused treatment. Also, other factors that are very relevant for this particular study are reasons for why the health care professionals did not prescribe opioid analgesics. Health care professionals may be hesitant to prescribe opioids because it can lead to addiction. If a patient has a history of opioid addiction then that may be a reason to not administer opioids.Lastly, they also did not measure nonanalgesic medications to treat abdominal pain. Below is a quote from the study.

>We also did not measure the use of Non analgesic medications to treat abdominal pain (e.g., H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, gastrointestinal ‘‘cocktails’’).

So again, this study cannot be used to claim that there is gender bias against women in health care. Lastly, you can read this [article](https://menarehuman.com/6195-2/) addressing the claims made about heart attacks if you want.

This is something that you will see a lot with these studies that people cite to claim gender bias. There are some important variables that are not controlled for in these studies. This is because health care treatment is such a complex thing that is influenced by so many factors that it is essentially impossible to create a study that controls for all of them, especially when you consider unobservable variables, like the way the patient communicates with their health care provider. This is one of the main reasons why I don’t think there is sufficient evidence to claim that there is gender bias in health care. There are so many things that can influence treatment. Age, race, painscore, diagnosis, comorbidities, hospital overcrowding, patient preference, insurance, location, contraindications based on test results, etc.
So as you can see, health care treatment is very complex and there are a lot of factors to consider. Another issue that could potentially lead to more women being misdiagnosed or having negative experiences in healthcare, is the fact that [the prevalence of autoimmune diseases is higher in women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7292717/) compared to men. Autoimmune diseases are difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms overlap with symptoms of other diseases.

This can lead to women being misdiagnosed more then men or feeling like their being gaslit by doctors. There could also be differences in the presentation of some conditions in men and women that may contribute to either sex being relatively more likely to be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. For example, girls may be better at masking their autism which can lead to them being under diagnosed, while boys may show more obvious signs of dysfunction.
Additionally, studies don’t consistently show that women are given less treatment. There are multiples studies showing no difference and there are also studies showing that men were given less treatment. You might have seen feminist cite this [research article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=383803) or [this one](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/prm/2018/6358624/) to prove that there is pervasive bias against women in health care. However, if you look at the studies cited in these papers not only do they suffer from some major limitations which includes not controlling for the many variables that I listed above, but they are also cherry picked studies that only show women getting less painkillers. Here are some other studies with different results.

[Gender-Associated Differences in Emergency Department Pain Management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196064495701079) 

>The patients were evaluated by 84 providers, 60 of them male. According to the providers surveyed, female patients described more pain than did male patients (P<.01) and were perceived by providers to experience more pain (P =.03). Female patients received more medications (P<.01) and were less likely to receive no medication (P =.01). Female patients also received more potent analgesics (P =.03). Linear and logistic regression analysis showed that patient perception of pain was the strongest predictor of the number and strength of medications given; patient gender was not a predictor.

[Impact of Physician and Patient Gender on Pain Management in the Emergency Department](https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/10/2/364/1833196?login=false)

>Analgesic administration rates were not significantly different for female and male patients (63% vs 57%, P = 0.08), although females presenting with severe pain (NRS ≥8) were more likely to receive analgesics (74% vs 64%, P = 0.02). 

[No gender-related bias in acute musculoskeletal pain management in the emergency department](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257755946_No_gender-related_bias_in_acute_musculoskeletal_pain_management_in_the_emergency_department) 

>Pain management measures (ie, analgesia administration, waiting time for analgesia, pain relief and patients' satisfaction) were prospectively assessed in 328 patients (150 women and 178 men, average age 36±18 years) who were treated in our ED for acute musculoskeletal pain. Patients' subjective pain rating on arrival were similar for men and women (59±24 mm vs 61±26 mm, respectively; p=0.47). Interestingly, physicians using the same scale assessed the women's pain level to be higher than that of men (75±25 mm vs 63±22 mm, respectively; p<0.001) and higher than that of women's subjective pain rating (75±25 mm vs 61±26 mm respectively; p<0.001). Nevertheless, the rates of analgesia administration, waiting time for analgesia, pain relief and patient satisfaction were similar for both genders. Physicians' own gender did not affect analgesic care.

[Prevalence and treatment of pain in adults admitted to Italian hospitals](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.ejpain.2004.04.004)

> The probability of receiving analgesic treatment was higher for women (OR ¼ 1.33, 95%CI: 1.14–1.54) and significantly lower for general medicine wards compared to surgical wards (OR ¼ 0.55, 95%CI: 0.45–0.64), while it was unrelated both to the patient’s self-reported pain and to the level of pain assessed by the nurse (Table 4).

[Do Gender and Race Affect Decisions About Pain Management?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495199/)

>No overall differences with respect to patient gender or race were found in decisions to treat or in the maximum permitted doses. 

[Disparities in Analgesia and Opioid Prescribing Practices for Patients With Musculoskeletal Pain in the Emergency Department](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0099176706000626)

>No gender or financial status disparities were found. 

[Pain in the Emergency Department with One-Week Follow-Up of Pain Resolution](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/prm/2005/781916/)

>Women were no less likely to have received analgesics in the ED (24%, versus 22% for men) or to not be prescribed analgesics (33%, versus 35% for men), although they were more likely (60%, versus 39% for men) to have taken analgesics in the week following the ED visit (χ2[1]=7.490, P<0.004).

Some other studies have been cited to claim that women get inadequate treatment for heart attacks, because they receive less aggressive treatment then men. However,one of the major confounders that is not adjusted for is age. Women tend to be older then men when they get heart attacks. Older people regardless of gender also receive less aggressive treatment. This could possibly be due to greater potential risk because older patients tend to be sicker and more frail. This [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2929899/) cites tons of studies that find differences in treatment with men receiving more aggressive treatment, and tons of other studies that show little to no difference in treatment. The studies that show little to no difference control for age, while the others don’t. The exception to this was with bypass surgeries were the results were mixed even after age was adjusted for. The researchers suggests this could be due to some other factors.

>Proposed explanations for gender differences include possible sex-related differences in anatomy (e.g., blood vessel size), operative risk and suitability for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus bypass surgery (Rathore et al. 2003; Bertoni et al. 2004; Jacobs and Eckel 2005; Barrett-Connor 2007).

I think this paper illustrates the point I’m trying to make. There are many factors that influence health care treatment. Therefore, I don’t think people can claim gender bias based on these observational studies.There is another [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20002005/) reviewing  90  studies on gender differences in stroke treatment that came to this conclusion.

>Sex differences in stroke treatment and outcome are small, with no unequivocal proof of sex discrimination. Women have less favorable functional outcome because of higher age at stroke onset and more severe strokes.

Aside from observational studies, there are some experimental studies using vignettes and virtual human patients. Vignette studies are studies where participants are presented with a hypothetical scenario, and then are asked what they think about it. The results of vignette studies are mixed. Some show no difference, while others show that women are perceived as being in more pain. In virtual human patient studies participants are shown videos of a virtual patient expressing pain, and they are asked what they think about it. These studies mostly show that women are perceived as being in more pain.

##Patient satisifaction surveys

Additionally, the 2018 study about gender norms in health care is a theory-guided literature review. Which means that it is a paper that is designed to only look at studies with gender disparities, and studies about gender norms in health care. They mention this in the paper.

>This review was theory-guided with a preunderstanding that gendered norms exist
in health care, which has influenced the selection of our search terms. Our directed literature search might be criticized as it potentially excluded studies that did not find/report
gender differences. However, the aim of this study was not to prove if gendered norms in health care exist, which earlier research already has shown [2, 3, 13], but to collect and
analyze gendered norms and gender bias as described in pain literature and deepen the knowledge about them.

This paper also doesn’t give us an idea to what extent this actually affects treatment in general. Studies that look into gender norms are qualitative, they have to be to get the in-depth information that is needed to know more about gender norms. The downside of this is that the generalizability is very limited with qualitative studies. I think if we are going to really try to understand how pervasive the issue is, some sort of quantitative survey would be more useful. The best thing that I could think of is patient satisfaction surveys. These surveys are meant to give you an idea of the quality of healthcare services that patients receive .Lets look at some of them. 


These first two are from Gallup, overall men and women showed no difference in patient satisfaction scores. There were small differences in some measures, but no difference overall. 

[Gender Comparisons: Patient Satisfaction and Loyalty](https://news.gallup.com/poll/7348/gender-comparisons-patient-satisfaction-loyalty.aspx - :~:text=However, Gallup patient satisfaction and,inpatient services than men do.)

[Healthcare Satisfaction: Men vs. Women](https://news.gallup.com/poll/7420/Healthcare-Satisfaction-Men-vs-Women.aspx)

The next source is a [systematic review](https://www.auajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1097/JU.0000000000003277.12). This paper found that women had slightly lower odds of submitting a patient satisfaction score that was higher than men’s. The odds ratio was 0.98 which means they were 2% less likely to submit a higher score. The author said this difference was not likely to be relevant, and that this systematic review alleviates any concerns that gender might impact patient satisfaction scores.Next, we have the [2022 kff women’s health survey](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/dashboard/2022-womens-health-survey/). This survey showed that women were more likely to have at least one negative interaction in the past two years, but the difference is not huge.38% of women reported having at least one negative interaction in the past two years, compared to 32% of men.  
Lastly, here is a report titled [“Gender Disparities In Health Care in Medicare advantage""](https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/OMH/Downloads/Health-Disparities-Gender-Disparities-National-Report.pdf). I thought it would be a good idea to include this one because alot of older people with health conditions use Medicare. According to the report, the patient experience was similar for men and women across all 8 patient experience measures.

Even though these surveys also can’t control for the various factor that influence treatment, at least they can give us any idea of  how health care services are for men and women in general. I think these surveys cast doubt on claims of pervasive misogyny in health care.
So to summarize, there are three lines of evidence used to support the claim that women are mistreated in health care, observational studies, virtual human patient studies, and vignette studies. Observational studies show mixed results, and do not account for many important variables, some of which are unobservable. This means that they are not adequate to support the claim that women are being mistreated because their women. Virtual human patients studies are probably the strongest evidence, because they are the best simulation of a real world interaction, while also still having experimental control. The participants get to see the virtual human patients facial expressions like they would see with a person in real life. It is not exactly the same of course, but it is the closest to a real world situation. Most of the virtual human patient studies I found showed that women were actually perceived as being in more pain, and were more likely to be recommended medical treatment.

 I was only able to find one study showing that men are perceived as having greater pain intensity, but there was no difference in pain treatment rating or willingness to administer opioid analgesics. Now there could be studies that I overlooked, but given the amount of studies that I found showing that women were perceived to be in more pain. I think that it is safe to say that the results of virtual humans studies are likely to be at the very least mixed. Then there are the vignette studies where participants are just shown written hypothetical scenarios. The problem with this is that text based vignettes lack ecological validity, because reading a hypothetical scenario is very different from dealing with a patient in real life. The results of the vignette studies were mixed. Another thing that I noticed that is worth mentioning is that a lot the vignette studies and virtual human patient studies had small unrepresentative samples. This severally limits the generalizability of these studies. There is also little to no difference in patient satisfaction between men and women.

Overall, I don’t think there is sufficient evidence to claim that men or women are dealing with widespread mistreatment in health care settings due to there sex. I think that it is a given that there will be some legitimate cases of sexism in health care, but i don’t think there is sufficient evidence to claim that there is pervasive sexism against women in health care.

# 3. Women are routinely over medicated, because drugs are not tested on women.


Whenever I see this claim being made, this is the [source](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/women-are-overmedicated-because-drug-dosage-trials-are-done-men-study-finds) that is cited. However, this is kind of misleading because the study that is cited isn’t conclusive, and they even acknowledge that they have not definitively proven that women are being routinely over medicated.

>Among the 27 drugs for which VB ratios were the only format of adverse event data, sex-biased PKs predicted sex-biased VigiBase ADR reporting ratios in 74% of instances (20 of 27 drugs were PK–VB ratio “concordant,” Table 2). In all but a few instances, VigiBase contained thousands of ADR reports, but as noted above, the number of men and women treated with each drug was not specified, nor are the links between the drug and specific ADRs known. It remains likely that some ADR sex differences in the VigiBase reflect unequal numbers of women and men treated with a given drug.

There are some other studies that analyze the proportion of women included in clinical trials for drugs, as well the subgroup analysis of drugs, and the safety and efficacy of those drugs for men and women. Here are those studies linked below.

[Gender differences in clinical registration trials: is there a real problem?](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bcp.13497)

>Our data showed that, overall, women are studied in adequate proportions, and that some type of gender subgroup analysis is performed for most drugs that are approved. The subgroup analyses on efficacy showed that the majority of drugs are equally effective in males and females. While there was a higher proportion of females with side effects compared with males, these differences were relatively small, and likely to be of little clinical significance. It is important to realize that gender difference is one of many variables that cause variability in drug response for efficacy and/or safety in any target population. Other factors include weight, age, genotype, phenotype, ethnicity, hormonal status, fasting conditions, polymorphisms of metabolizing enzymes, receptor expression and sensitivity, co-medication interactions, co-morbidities, pregnancy status, gut microbiome status 18-22. Many of these factors are known to induce substantially more variability than gender if they are distributed heterogeneously in the target population .

[Sex based subgroup differences in randomized controlled trials: empirical evidence from Cochrane meta-analyses](https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5826)

>Our empirical evaluation of statistically significant sex-treatment interactions from the CDSR revealed only eight (7%) statistically significant sex-treatment interactions among 109 topics. This is not much beyond what would be expected by chance alone. With only eight statistically significant interactions, it is likely that the number of false positives outnumbered the number of true positives. Also, certain reviews had more than one topic, which could lead to an overlap of topics with non-independent data. However, even when we selected only one topic for each review or allowed for multiple comparisons with one outcome per review, the statistically significant sex-treatment interactions would still be uncommon (4/41 (10%) and 7/61 (12%), respectively), not far from what is expected from chance. 

[Differences in Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceutical Treatments between Men and Women: An Umbrella Review](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0011895)

>Findings, based on 59 studies and data of more than 250,000 patients suggested that for the majority of drugs no substantial differences in efficacy and safety exist between men and women. Some clinically important exceptions, however, were apparent: women experienced substantially lower response rates with newer antiemetics than men (45% vs. 58%; relative risk 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.35–1.64); men had higher rates of sexual dysfunction than women while on paroxetine for major depressive disorder; women discontinued lovastatin more frequently than men because of adverse events. Overall, for the majority of drugs sex does not appear to be a factor that has to be taken into consideration when choosing a drug treatment. 

So, overall this evidence goes against the claim of women being routinely overmedicated, and also shows that drugs are tested on women. Most drugs seem be about equally safe and effective for men and women, with some drugs being either worse for women or men. Now when it comes to how many adverse drug reactions are reported, it is true that women report more ADR’s then men, but men seem to report more serious and fatal ADR’s.

[Reported adverse drug reactions in women and men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6933269/)

>We find that female ADR reports outnumber male ADR reports across the globe, in all adult ages and by all available reporter types. Male reports however, to a larger extent, more often contain serious and fatal ADRs than female reports.

However, this is not solid evidence that women are being routinely overmedicated. There are so many factors that can cause the disparity, one of them being the use of contraceptive, which the study did control for, and this reduced the proportion of women reporting ADR’s. The fact that men report more serious and fatal ADR’s could also suggest that women are more likely to report ADR’s in general even if there not as serious. There are numerous reasons for why this could be the case, and the study suggests a few reasons. The main takeaway though, is that this is far from definitive proof. This is just information from a database that people can report to, with no way to actually prove causation.

Lastly, feminist will mention the drug zolpidem as a prime example of androcentrism in medical research, but even this has been widely [contested](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/srichard/files/making_a_sex-difference_fact_2023.pdf).

# 4. Women’s health is underfunded.


This claim originated from this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8290307/).Which was then discussed in this [nature article](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-023-01475-2/index.html).In the study, the total numbers of Daly’s for a disease is compared to the NIH funding for that disease to determine if the funding for the disease is commensurate with the disease burden, or if it is underfunded or overfunded. Then they look at the proportion of men and women with the disease and categorize the disease as either gender neutral, female semi-dominant, female dominant, male semi-dominant, or male-dominant. If a disease is underfunded and female/male dominant it is consider male favoring or female favoring. Disease are consider gender neutral if the proportion of people with the disease are 50-55% of one sex, disease that are semi-dominant range from 55-60%,and dominant disease are disease that are at 60% or higher.In the study they also count the total number of male-favoring, and female-favoring diseases. This is determined by looking if the male or female dominant disease is either underfunded or over-funded. So for example, a male dominant disease that is over-funded is consider male-favoring, but a male dominant disease that is underfunded is consider female-favoring.

So that pretty much sums up the methodology. I think that there are multiples issues with this study that invalidates it. One of the major issues is that this study doesn’t take severity into account when determine if women’s health is underfunded as a whole. Instead the total number of female-favoring and male-favoring diseases are just counted up, and then it gives a percentage of the amount that is male-favoring. I think this is too simplistic. For example why should a headache be counted equally compared to liver cancer. Shouldn’t the underfunding of liver cancer be given more weight, because it is a more severe health condition? Another, issue that I see is with the actual measure that is used. The DALY works by adding the total of numbers of years lost and years of disability together to create this number that represents the overall disease burden for a disease. This seems fine, until you consider the fact that this would mean allocating more funds to people with diseases that are less severe for them as individual patients. There is a good example of what I’m talking about in this [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1470594X221138729) discussing whether or not health research funding should be proportional to disease burden.

>To give a concrete example, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the total DALY burden attributable to lung cancer in some HICs is similar to that attributable to low back pain (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2021b). Both are the cause of very substantial disability and—in the case of lung cancer—many early deaths. But the prevalence of low back pain is several orders of magnitude greater than the prevalence of lung cancer. Low back pain is just not as bad for an individual patient as lung cancer (this is like Scenario 4). If the arguments I have given so far are correct, this suggests that, conditional on scientific opportunity, more funding should be allocated to lung cancer research than to low back pain research.

The next issue that I have with this article is that it does not take into account the many other factors besides disease burden that determines funding. One of them being scientific opportunity. Which is the benefit that you can expect for the amount of money you allocate for a particular disease. This is actually mentioned in the paper under the section titled “ Disease burden as a funding criterion and NIH funding priorities"". So I think I have shown that health research funding is more complex then what this study presents, and when you are comparing different disease there are many factors that need to be considered. This study uses an indirect and oversimplified way of determining commensurate funding. Which is why I don’t think that it actually proves that women’s health is underfunded. So what would be a better way to compare women’s health funding to men’s health funding? We can look at this [report](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/ORWH_BiennialReport2019_20_508.pdf) by the office of research on women’s health. If you look at pg. 112-117 you can see charts showing the NIH budget for health conditions. In total, funding for women's health is twice that of men’s health. The charts shows the budget for men and women’s health for each disease. There are some massive disparities in sex-specific funding in some diseases where men are affected just as much or more than women. Some examples are lung cancer, stroke, and suicide. I think this a more apt comparison, because you can compare funding for the same diseases.

#5.Women have worse post-operative outcomes with male surgeons(Misogyny!)


This is the [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2786671) that is cited to backup this claim. This is an observational study that only finds an association between male surgeon & female patient sex discordance and worse post-operative outcomes. They cannot determines the reasons for why this happens, but there are various reasons why this could be the case, besides hostile discrimination against women. Below are some good critiques of this study, and the conclusions that people draw from them.

Conclusion: The evidence for medical misogyny is either inconclusive or invalid.

Insecure people aren't necessarily bad partners. They don't always ask for reassurance at all times or guilt-trip you. Some might, some might not. It depends on how they manage it. Hell, having a partner who cares about them can be enough to help them manage it on their own or at least without doing those 2 things people say all of them do.

It's not that men don't value confidence. They don't find it unattractive. The thing is: they aren't going to ghost a woman easily over the slightest insecurity she has, nor do people put all these extreme pressure on women to be confident and call them red flags if they aren't.

To preface this; my mother isn’t a crazy feminist but adopts feminists views when it benefits her. 

When I was 14 my grandfather (my dads dad) committed suicide and it left him broken for a few years. It was a traumatic moment in my dads life and my mom did basically nothing to help him. She would actively complain about how closed off and depressed he became. I remember her being so confused about his behavior expecting him to get over it instantly, It felt like she was mad at him for having normal human emotions. He didn’t become violent or abusive, just closed off and depressed. She devised a plan to leave him for one of her coworkers after my brother and I graduated high school. That broke him even worse than his father killing himself. She told him that if he became more committed to her than she she would stay. He spent a couple months dedicated to saving his marriage and even got a better job because that was another problem she had with him. It was all a lie and she left him anyway and telling him to get a better job was to get herself more money in the divorce. I would get calls from him wasted on the brink of suicide while i was in college. One time my mom and I were fighting about she handled the divorce and told her about the calls. Big mistake as she would then try to use that as a reason that he’s unstable and I shouldn’t speak to him anymore. Women will ruin a man’s life and then get surprised when their upset.

If the boat is getting a leak there is a chance that no men are going to have a seat on the lifeboat until all of the puppies and women and children are safe.

Maybe even if a women or a children or a pet gets lost in the woods there is a bigger search team looking for them compared to when it happens to a men.

When something similar happens to a men, the comments say that he is responsible for what happened, because maybe he did something bad and he is a men so he should be able to help himself.

1707538483.0,A theory about bullying and other things,"People bully at school. This everyone knows. From what i've learnt, not all bullying is equal. Some bullying is enough to ruin somebodies life when they are child. Other bullying is trivial enough that the damage is eliminated within a day. In fact, the name itself actually diminishes the impact of the life destroying cases by equating it with the trivial ones, but this is another topic for a different time.

&#x200B;

Imagine you are a bully. You have bullied somebody else covertly or overtly or joined in as such such that you have ruined the person's life. For example, you kept villainizing and slandering an autistic young boy until he murdered somebody else because he couldn't take it, or screwed up his mind so badly that nobody wants anything to do with him. You did this knowing the damage you have done to this person. A bully is someone who wants his own safety and prosperity above everything else. If this became known people wouldn't want anything to do with you, or at the very least your reputation will be damaged. You'll be surprised how much damage one (or a group) of humans can do to other humans without breaking the law, heck, without breaking any moral (socially acceptable) laws. It is perfectly possible to ruin somebodies life and be able to morally justify it given societies beliefs about morality if the person is vulnerable enough even if he/she hasn't done anything to deserve it. Say we call the victim X. Now say you go to somewhere else like college or a club and you find other people like X. You also find other people like you (let's say Y) who have done similar things, who get similar benefits from bullying other people and who similarly want to get away with what they do. Y and X are classes of people, not individuals. If any of people X end up being accepted or healing, they will probably speak out about what Y has done. It does not matter if the person who speaks out is a stranger or not the person you bullied. If people hear about the story, the people you are with will not take too long for them to connect the dots that if bullying policy Z was done against Y and you did policy Z then you must have the crime described even if your particular victim couldn't speak out. Therefore, to get away with it, every person of type X must be silenced.

&#x200B;

I think this explain why so many people (men and women, but mostly men as far as I know like people with social anxiety, autism, social issues, ect...) go around from place to place being constantly bullied and abused and treated as if they are worthless human beings. Y gains advantage from bullying and silences X by abusing them beyond their capability to heal. If they can't heal, they can't process what has happened to them and commit suicide before they can speak out. The more abuse Y heaps on X, the more Y gains from the abuse itself and the less likely Y will be caught. Because of this, people like X get abused everywhere and this isn't an accident. It is being deliberately made as hard as possible for all of them so that Y will be able to have better at the expense of the entire lives of X.

&#x200B;

We all stand on the shoulders of giants. I believe that when the soil is right and when the conditions (like weather and sunshine) are right then something will grow. If I scatter 1000 seeds of corn over a field and wait I don't have to prove that at least one of them has grown. By the laws of nature, the starting conditions specific proof that something has grown is unnecessary. By the laws of nature (and probability) I can say that there is a very high chance that something has, even if I don't see the field again.

This affects a lot of men. A lot of men are bullied throughout their lives and have their lives ruined by it. Especially with social phobia, too passive (you know what I mean), autistic, incel, ect... it starts when they are young (it did for me) so it makes sense to post it here.

Hope you guys can offer some advice. I have a ""disability"", neurodivergent. So adhd/autism type symptoms so Im really struggling in school. Think i've even given up on this career. But you know what makes me shed a tear and become cold inside: Seeing the school being ill designed for not only disabilities but for men overall.

 Also all my teachers/superiors currently (on paediatrics) are female. Doctors are mostly becoming female. Nurses are almost 100% female. Aides are usually female. Cleaners are often female. But see this, the handymen are still male. No problem with them but it always FEELS like a female talking down to a male ""education"" wise.

1707505849.0,Let’s discuss touch deprivation in mens lives.,"This is something that has occurred to me at many points in life but not something I see often discussed as a particular need and / or problem for male life. 

Men, how often do you get positive touch? Especially without an expectation of something provided in return?  

And I’m not just talking about sex, foreplay or the usual slap and tickle that young couples (at least used to) do; although those can count. I’m also talking about a friendly pat in the back, hand on a shoulder, an unexpected massage or a back scratch. Any positive freely given touch.

Have you even thought about it?

I’ll say for me it’s rare. Very rare at times. I’ve never been much of a hugger outside of very close family and people sense that. Even for family touch mostly disappeared in my teen years and has never returned. 

I might hug my parents on occasion and kiss my mom on the cheek but outside of that it’s not a thing. During college I had fraternity brothers that would play fight and that does connect you. As an adult very, very few people ever touch me.

I’m a middle aged married man with kids and my wife will not initate touch with me any longer except for an occasional hug for herself and when she’s had a few and is feeling playful. She’s fine with me touching her, she’s just not going to reciprocate or initiate. She doesn’t say it but it seems to have become a chore.  When I’ve tried to (gently) discuss it she acts like she doesn’t know what I am talking about.

What’s worse is our kids have picked up on this and are now imitating. I expected this some as they got older but what hurts very much is the revulsion they will imitate while turning around 10min later and jumping on me to come play. I know that as they age that imitation will become a real behavior.

Women have suffered greatly during history, physically and mentally. Now that we have given them more and more freedom, radicals are trying to act out their weird fantasies of establishing their own utopia. It is going to get worse and worse, until we as a society reach a turning-point, where everything goes back to where it was hundreds of years ago, whether it be in regards to rights for men or women, no matter who of them is going to be impacted, one of these genders will. 

And we as men already face the consequences daily: 

False accusations of rape after rejecting advances, being called „Gay“ as an insult when rejecting pushy or aggressive women in bars or being told to „enjoy it“, when we get sexually assaulted or harassed, the list goes on…

At one point, when one gender has been oppressed for dozens, if not hundreds of years, there will be a young generation of people fighting for their rights, no matter what gender they belong to.

It is going to lead to more and more rights for this gender, until they too, have radicals rising in their ranks, wanting to act out their sick fantasies of their own, gender-controlled world.

We already see the impact this creates on society. We here on r/MensRights are the victims ofthis practices:

We will see the reinstatement of gender-based discrimination, and it looks more likely, that we will get the heat of it first, before it switches to the female gender again. After that, it will hit us, then them, then us, then them etc…

We can only defend our souls, but our Life‘s, Job, Friends and Family can all be taken away by a single, rejected, spiteful accusation…

I'm not an attorney and this is not legal advice.

Judicial immunity provides for protection for judicial acts when a judge or judicial officer is acting within their authority.

> Generally. Judicial immunity is a longstanding concept, the purpose of which is to assure judicial independence.

> “As early as 1872, the Court recognized that it was ‘a general principle of the highest importance to the proper administration of justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authority vested in him, [should] be free to act upon his own convictions without apprehension of personal consequences to himself.’ “ Stump v. Sparkman 435 U.S. 349, 355 (1978) (quoting Bradley v. Fisher,80 U.S. 335, 347 (1871)).

> BASICS OF JUDICIAL IMMUNITY

> NORTH CAROLINA SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES’ BENCHBOOK

> https://benchbook.sog.unc.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Judicial%20Immunity%20Mar.%202015.pdf

For other acts which are not judicial in nature, the lower standard of governmental immunity may apply.

Government officials often have or claim governmental immunity, and this is often qualified immunity.

> ""Specifically, qualified immunity protects a government official from lawsuits alleging that the official violated a plaintiff's rights, only allowing suits where officials violated a “clearly established” statutory or constitutional right. When determining whether or not a right was “clearly established,” courts consider whether a hypothetical reasonable official would have known that the defendant’s conduct violated the plaintiff’s rights. Courts conducting this analysis apply the law that was in force at the time of the alleged violation, not the law in effect when the court considers the case.""

> Qualified Immunity

> https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity

Social workers, prosecutors and judges may share some aspects of judicial immunity.

However, if someone is not acting in a judicial act, they may have the lower standard.
 
If a prosecutor is involved in the investigative process and is involved in the altering or hiding of evidence during the investigative phase they face the same level of immunity as any detective who may have done the same (which is the lower standard of qualified immunity):

> When a prosecutor performs the investigative functions normally performed by a detective or police officer, it is ""neither appropriate nor justifiable that, for the same act, immunity should protect the one and not the other."" Hampton v. Chicago, 484 F. 2d 602, 608 (CA7 1973) 274*274 (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 415 U. S. 917 (1974). Thus, if a prosecutor plans and executes a raid on a suspected weapons cache, he ""has no greater claim to complete immunity than activities of police officers allegedly acting under his direction."" 484 F. 2d, at 608-609.

> Their mission at that time was entirely investigative in character. A prosecutor neither is, nor should consider himself to be, an advocate before he has probable cause to have anyone arrested.[5]

> 509 U.S. 259 (1993) BUCKLEY v. FITZSIMMONS et al.

> https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6691481497633541172&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr

Note this may apply to social workers who also perform judicial functions and may enjoy some absolute immunity for those judicial functions (such as making recommendations).

So if a social worker is intentionally violating the rights of a parent in a manner not related to judicial acts, and which may be criminal, e.g. falsifying phone contact records, they may have no immunity for those acts.

The comments were even more disgusting, calling those men as Incels, commenting on those men's looks, saying that Margot Robbie is way out of their league and what not. The fact that the YouTuber had to make a video shaming people who did not agree with the opinion that Margot is beautiful shows how systemic it is!

I've come across videos of women rating male celebrities, and some women have said attractive celebrities as Mid or ugly. Heck, I've seen a video of a woman saying that Robert Pattinson as ugly and that he's overrated! Sure, this was surprising for me, but I believed she/they have preferences and that she/they are entitled to her/their opinion!

 It's hypocrisy that when those men called Margot mid, they were shamed and told that she was way out of their league, called p\*orn addict and asked to touch grass. But when that woman called Pattinson as ugly, no one commented that he was way out of her/their league or B.S like that!

And it's just one of the many examples!

Why is it that the society considers it not okay for men to express their preferences? **We need to teach women that** ***Men can have preferences*** **too and that he's free to express them, even when it's negative or when he's not agreeing with yours.

At work today had to help a customer look for something in my ""favorite"" section, social sciences which has women's studies (but of course no men's studies) and seeing books that had these stupid terms and whatnot as part of their titles, blurbs, etc. You can imagine my utter irritation seeing all of this.

In Western nations I don't believe any of these are real concepts with a tangible basis in reality. Considering there's always so much aid and support given to women but next to none for men. It's beyond annoying to constantly see or hear them uttered by misandrists when describing things that women suffer from or how they say men can never experience things like sexism (blatantly false). I feel anytime someone evokes these concepts, they cease to be someone who's credible or has integrity when they'll blame imaginary problems as a means of invaldiating serious issues affecting men and boys, or to enforce female victimhood. 

It's a terribly regressive way of thinking that does no good to either men or women, continuing to put down and marginalize the former and infantalize the latter.

Edit - added ""systemic toxic masculinity"" to the list. I think toxic masculinity is a BS term and concept in the first place, but in a discussion elsewhere on toxic femininity, someone said while it exists it lacks ""systemic"" effects like it's counterpart supposedly has, when there's zero evidence for that. Claiming something is ""systemic"" is just another way misandrists like to enforce their delusions of men as oppressors.

Any goals, blueprints, suggestions, guide, etc?","TL;DR I am 29M UK, recently changed careers and feel I got my shit together by myself. Issue, I feel like I missed out on the important parts of life like that of a prisoner. I struggle in my personal life but my work life is okay. I simply don't want to regress or remain stagnant and so I would like any mentor/fatherly advice as to what I need to do with my life as I was never that eager dreamer like some men are that helps them in their life.

I am 29M UK and only recently found a job as a Junior Software Developer for 22k in the UK. Sure it's low but gotta start somewhere to rack up crediability. I managed to achieve this because I did a conversion degree in computer science. I did it because I wanted to get out from the dead end and emotionally abusive job that is Psychology.

Growing up, basically a shitty history and surprised that I was able to jump in tech the way I did. The issue is, I don't exactly have friends or lovers, never really did given the stuff I had to deal with. When I am at work and generally busy with work, I don't feel like I have the time to feel ""sorry"" for myself. It's just work. When I don't work, it hits me like a truck and my brain is like ""what if?"" when really, given the cards I was dealt, I should be dead.

I am 29 and I feel uneasy. Not death or anything, I feel like I died long ago before I even had a chance to live. It's more like the ability to have ""fun"" or ""popular"" or any of those so-called childish stuff is gone forever. It feels like I never got to flourish and now I am trying to progress whilst dealing with tje grief of my lost potential. Despite the progress I have made, I still feel like that traumatised kid pretending to be an adult.

I have been to therapy a few times but they make it very clear that I should just ""get on with it"" and nothing more. One thing is that I don't want to sleep away my life again as I did when I was younger. I only slept my life away because of a whole host of issues. Now I ""technically"" have power but I feel like those men that have been in prison for half their life and when they get out, they are really old men that cannot get to grips with life.

I was thinking about that movie “The Wedding Singer” this morning. In it, the main female characters mom wants her daughter to fake a pregnancy to get her boyfriend to ask her to marry him. The mom says this nonchalantly and the audience laughs but that’s a really horrible thing to do. Why would a woman think that the best way to get a husband is to fake a pregnancy? What’s happens after the wedding and she reveals she’s not pregnant?  What is this poor sap reasonably supposed to do at that point?  
I have a child because a girl I was dating got pregnant “accidentally on purpose” mainly because I was entering the military and she knew she and the child would be taken care of. Well I can tell you I did not fall for this. You can think I’m horrible because of that but I wasn’t going to have my life dictated by some trailer trash. So she got a paycheck from me for 18 years.

Me and my friend decided we would buy them too with the group of lads, after purchasing we put them in our pockets and went on with the trip. 

Later that night when we were having food in a reasturant I was called over by a teacher where they had said a female friend of mine had accused me of saying that I was going to use it on her, I was nowhere near that certain girl all day and she wasn’t in the friendship group I had.

When I tried to explain to the teacher that I had not been near the girl but I had been with my friends they didn’t believe me. One of the male teachers thought it was strange and he kind of looked after me through that trip.

During the trip nothing more was said about it until the next week when we got back to the UK where I was pulled into the head of years office where I was told there had been a complaint by the parents of the girl. They asked me what happened and my story was completely different to what the girl had said.

It affected me in school from then on people refused to talk to me, until a couple years later when I found out the girl had lied to the teacher and she came up to me and told me she had.

1707348652.0,How I deconstructed out of the men's rights movement,"I encountered the men's rights movement during my young adulthood, about the time I developed an addiction to pornography. These two are linked, because both the men's rights activist and the porn addict are discipled into seeing women as objects, explaining the substantial overlap. I don't have a handsome mug or good social skills, and I thought as long as I was broke, I had no way of getting any women's attention. This made me bitter

Regrettably, much of my technical skills comes from finding workarounds to the filters I had put in place. My dad and I were involved in a full arms race, in which I ultimately had a Pyrrhic victory. Through this he patiently informed me on how what I was doing was poisoning my mind in regards to my view of women. He hit the nail on the head. He discussed the entitlement I felt that led me to porn. This was the same entitlement that embittered me into believing, without evidence, that they'd mistreat me and get away with it.

When I got my first job, I was asked what sort of women I was into. Word got around the shop, and a woman of the description I gave came around and began to slap me on my rear. I was taken aback. She repeatedly asked to sleep with me as well. I asked my dad advice and he said he knew this situation was stroking my ego.

And it did. My ego was stroked harder than Randy Travis and Tim Curry put together. He further told me about a situation that occurred a few years after he was married, when a female coworker wanted to go on every business trip with him and even asked to share the same hotel room with him despite the company affording to lodge them separately. He found it in his heart to forgive her, but still sought to be transferred to a different department. His coworker, like mine, was discipled into thinking she had no value besides which and how many men she slept with. However, I was not raised to see women that way. I did, but only after deliberately going against what I had been taught.

It was then I realized what my coworker was doing to me was what I had been doing to countless women through a computer screen. She was guilty of (confirmably) treating one man like a sex object, and I had already lost track of how many women I was guilty of treating like a sex object. What she did was wrong. What I did was worse. She later apologized for what she did. I did one of the hardest things ever in my life to that point. I had shoveled concrete in the middle of summer. I had run mules straight without a breather. I had stood in for managers during lunch rush. I had managed to get good enough scores on my ACT to skip an entire math class at university. What thing was harder than all of this?

I forgave her.

The thought of filing a harassment claim crossed my mind. Think about it: I was one formal complaint away from getting her fired. Any subsequent employer would ask her why she lost her job, and would likely refuse to hire her if they knew. With just one signature, I could have doomed this woman to a lifetime of begging and/or prostitution. My coworker's ability to provide for herself was not worth my personal sense of revenge, and I could not stand in judgement of her when what I had done held no consequences for my career.

Knowing that I was left off the hook for the things I had done, it started to dawn on me that men really have gotten the better end of the stick, and I began to examine the claims I had heard from the men's rights movement. I found that most custody arrangements are decided outside the courts; conscription laws globally are written mostly by men, in order to fight wars that benefit rich men; that no-fault divorce benefits more men than women, and men who don't want to provide for their ex-wives had the option of not marrying them in the first place; and that women don't have an easier time than men making accusations of sexual assault. It was about eight months after my coworker and I reconciled that I fully discarded the movement.

And I am glad I have.

1707279627.0,BDE and SDE,"By far the most shameful yet acceptable terms used to describe a man and his character, the terms BDE ( Big Dick Energy) and SDE ( Small Dick Energy) are confidently and regularly used by women to judge men.

It's a weird world we live in, where a man is judged on something that he has absolutely no control over, and this is not only limited to our penis size but our height as well.

Its constant use in multiple piece of media and by actual people in the everyday life, proves of the viciousness of today's culture where men can be attacked on everything.

And when people tell that men are the ones who are insecure because of their average or less than average size, it boils my blood. What else would you expect? The constant use of the term in a humourous manner, to deliberately make men feel incompetent in every piece of media and by women, what reaction would they expect from men ?

I  would love if women were shamed on their weight, height, cup size, their vaginas etc, even the scales a bit. But realistically that ain't happening, because women are the most protected group, free from any criticizitions. The most funny thing is the one thing women get absolutely mad about being criticised, which is their weight, is easily controllable, yet they go out of their way to protect themselves because women don't know the definition of accountability of their actions.

I don't care whether it's a joke or not, don't bodyshame men, don't bodyshame anyone. But if they aren't listening, definitely do throw a comment back at them.

If you have anyone in your life, still using these terms or basically any other methods of bodyshaming men, I would suggest educating them ( though I believe that won't help ) or straight up cut any form of contact with them.

1707269786.0,Is being a male a disadvantage in the workplace for both hirings and promotions?,"I just wanted to gauge other people’s experience on whether they have noticed any potential gender disparities in regard to workplace opportunities (both hirings and promotions) throughout their careers.

In my 15 years of Biotech/Pharma industry experience, here are some of the trends that I have noticed.  

Note: these are just subtle observations that I (n=1) have noticed throughout my career and it may not reflect the norm.

— Hiring Process —
- If an equally qualified male and female apply to the same role, the female candidate is (significantly) more likely to be contacted for an interview.
- When applying to the same role, male candidates must be more qualified than their female counterparts, but they cannot be too qualified.  Otherwise, their application will be rejected.
- When interviewing, men are more likely to experience interviews (neutral) or interrogations (negative), whereas women experience more conversations (positive).
- When companies use a standardized interview process, women are more likely to experience positive non-verbal communication than men.
- When interviewing women, hiring managers are primarily looking for red flags for not hiring them, whereas for men, they’re initially discarded must prove why they should be hired.
- When companies hire women for leadership positions, they are more likely to celebrate and announce the hiring on social media.
- When companies celebrate hitting their diversity targets, it often primarily benefits women (who may actually be the majority in the company or department).
- Hiring managers are praised for hiring women onto their teams over men.
- HR interviewers are primarily women, which likely skews the candidates that move forward with the hiring manager in favor of women.

— Workplace Promotions —
- Women require less accomplishments than their male counterparts to become eligible for promotions.
- Line managers are more likely to assist women with their yearly goals in order to fast-track them for promotions (or give them easy ones).
- Men require more years of experience than women to be considered an SME (Subject Matter Expert) for a given discipline.

— Ramifications of the Above —
- When applying to jobs, women need to apply to less companies before getting hired, they’re more likely to get a highly desired job, and their new job is more likely to be a promotion instead of a lateral move.
- Since men are more likely to have to settle for lateral moves, they will experience more criticism from interviewers if their resume had indicated that they had any history of job hopping.
- Women are getting promoted into leadership positions at a much younger age than their equally or more-qualified male counterparts, allowing them to make hiring decisions early on and influence company culture sooner.
- Since women are getting fast-tracked into leadership, they are earning significantly more money than their male peers of the same age, earning them potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars more throughout the course of their careers.
- Due to the current system, men have jobs and women have careers.
- Since men are beginning to see that the workplace is significantly biased against them, they are engaging in quiet-quitting and only doing the bare minimum (even if that was not their original desired intent).
- Companies are creating exclusive intracompany groups (‘Women in Leadership’) for advancing the careers of women.  Even suggesting such a group for men is a laughable offense (or worse).
- Due to the favoritism toward women, men are more likely to experience poor end-of-year reviews, go on PIPs (performance improvement plans), get assigned grunt work, experience poor morale, get blacklisted, have their ideas get ignored by management, not get credit for their efforts, stagnate in their career, become demoralized by the work environment, etc.",MensRights

1707245571.0,Another Example of Unjust Bias on Relationship Sub,"Lol. It is so annoying to see this. I know most men and women in this world are great people. But the fact that there are some women and men that can be so deluded into thinking this mindset is justified just pisses me off. I know I should not have my emotions affected much by social media but it just sucks.

The post I am talking about comes from a relationship sub that tries to determine who is the asshole based on a one-sided POV post, the man is crucified for feeling betrayed that his wife packed a ""go bag"" and has kept it for a long time as a secret. A ""go bag"" is like an escape bag which can be used to escape a relationship. As any logical person would be, the man was hurt that his wife was basically insinuating that he is an abuser by having this bag and keeping it for multiple years. He felt like he needed to break up because how could you be with someone that thinks you are a potential danger and an abuser? And for this, he gets crucified for being an emotional abuser. Apparently you aren't allowed to be hurt by this kind of action. Apparently, this just shows that he has abusive traits and may have been an abuser in the past. All because he feels betrayed and hurt. But wait. Maybe it would be somewhat justified if they had a similar viewpoint in a similar roles reversed situation regarding paternity tests.

Women should not try to break up and they should not be offended if their male partners suggest a paternity test right? That would be emotional abuse towards the male partner? Nah, according to this alleged sub, that is perfectly alright, and the woman would not be an asshole. Women can have feelings but Men can't. The bias is just unreal and annoying at this point.

Another misandrist quote displayed in the trenches of this thread that I thought was so stupid. It said something along the lines that the worst thing a woman can do to a man is laugh at them but the worst thing a man can do to a woman is kill them. Do they think paternity fraud(cheating) is not a bad thing? Do they think men can't be abused and killed by women?

Growing up, I was inundated about my ""Male Privilege"", at school, on social media, you name it. I think now that I graduated, I have finally discovered my privilege. My life right now consists of the following:

1) Go to Work

2) Go to the Gym

3) \[Insert hobby/other cope\]

4) Sleep & Repeat

Maintaing friendships was extremely hard considering my work hours, so I go weeks without talking to people. So most of my days I don't say a single word, maybe if I'm lucky I'll say a couple sentences at work. Dating is pretty much non existent, I'm barely seen as a human and get <10 matches.

I thought one day, so this is the male privilege they were talking about, nice.. but I must be a rare exception, other men couldn't be facing similar challenges. Then I asked my fellow work colleagues who are in the 20's like me (all male), how they're experience was. To the shock of my naive self, they too barely had a life outside work, and on dating. So then I started searching online, and I saw many men on youtube, reddit etc airing out similar experiences and fast forward a few years later ""The male loneliness epidemic"" is a trending topic. 

Meanwhile, I look at my female cousins and peers. Holidays to x country, new boyfriend every few months. Buy this, buy that etc. One of my cousins showed me her instagram profile and their were 50+  unread requests from desperate guys wanting to get to know her... It seems a-lot of men live lifes of quiet isolation, forsaken to wage slaving & paining away at the gym, just for the slightest chance to get a woman, the slightest chance to have someone to talk to and care about them.

1707217285.0,Jari Wise Inquest Day 1 Today - Tensions Flared!,"Hi there. The inquest into the death of Jari Wise started in Hobart today. I noticed that his case had been discussed in the past in this forum and thought some might appreciate an update.

This inquest is to do with what some feel was the injustice of the case of a young man, Jari Wise, allegedly murdered by his female partner in a fit of drunken rage, and never being charged with his death (only with driving related offences). Some have suggested that if the sexes had been reversed, the person driving the car would have had a very different experience. It also potentially exposes issues with our legal system, as Jari's family believe that the legal system has failed Jari, and also Jari's mother had to fight for a long time to get this inquest. Jari's mother is now a passionate advocate for men's rights and wants to expose the inequity in the legal system.

If you haven't heard about the case a quick Reddit or Google search will give you lots of information, especially the sentencing notes from Melissa Oates' court case [https://www.supremecourt.tas.gov.au/sentences/oates-m/](https://www.supremecourt.tas.gov.au/sentences/oates-m/). 60 Minutes also did their own investigation which is linked here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBbtS9c7I-g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBbtS9c7I-g).

The Mercury newspaper write-up is (of course) behind a paywall but here is the basic text of the article entitled ""Tensions flare on day one of inquest into death of Jari Wise"".

Tensions have flared on day one of the long-awaited inquest into the death of Huon Valley man Jari Wise, with one witness arrested and another warned by the coroner. A young woman forcefully denying she ""invented"" a scenario to protect her friend from blame.

The two day Hobart inquest which began on Tuesday, is being held after years of tireless campaigning by Mr Wise's mother Faith Tkalac and following an extraordinary intervention by former Attorney-General Elise Archer.

Held before Coroner Simon Cooper, the inquest aims to uncover whether or not Mr Wise jumped out in front of the car that killed him, which was driven by his on-off girlfriend Melissa Oates.

Oates, who was never charged with causing Mr Wise's death in the early hours of Febrary 29, 2020, will give evidence on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Oates' friend, Jessica Hosking, who failed to show at the inquest and was taken into custody for a period by police at Huonville.

Mr Cooper said due to concerns for her welfare, it was unlikely he would compel her to give evidence. Ms Hosking was released without charge.

The same day, Oates' cousin Amber Lovell cried, swore repeatedly and frequently refused to answer when cross-examined on whether or not she had lied to police about Mr Wise having a history of jumping in front of card.

""I can't do this, I'm f...ing sick of it"" she said at one point.

""It's f...ing bullshit.

""I'd rather be locked up than have to deal with this shit.""

Ultimately, Mr Cooper demanded Ms Lovell be removed from her remote witness room and give evidence before him in the witness stand - warning her to conduct herself properly.

Ms Lovell denied under cross-examination from Ms Tkalac's lawyer, Fabiana Cengelosi, that she ""invented"" a story about Mr Wise stepping out in front of her car a week before he died.

She denied she was attempting to protect Oates, and also denied her cousin had told her she was ""going with a version"" that Mr Wise had stepped in front of her vehicle on the night of his death.

Another friend who had been socialising with Oates and Wise on the night of his death gave testimony. Katie Shead said she hadn't witnessed Mr Wise jumping in front of Oates' car on a previous occasion, years before his death, but that he in fact ""jumped back"".

Tasmania Police crash investigator Kelly Cordwell attend the scene of Mr Wise's death at 2.44am, with Mr Wise covered with a blanket outside Huonville High School.

She said it appeared Mr Wise had been standing on the roadway in the south bound lane, with his body ""almost if not toally, front-on"" to the vehicle.

Senior Constable Cordwell said Mr Wise would have ridden up onto the windscreen on the passenger side of Oates' car and likely became airborne - his body travelling some 34 metres from the point of impact.

She said there was no evidence of Oates swerving or braking prior to the point of impact - or afterwards.

""The debris indicated the vehicle has continued, with the debris continuing to fall of the vehicle"" she said.

Forensic pathologist Donald Ritchie, who performed an autopsy on Mr Wise, said his death would have been ""near-instantaneous"" when he was struck by Oates' car.

Counsel assisting the coroner, Emily Bill, said Oates served jail time for dangerous driving, drink driving and failing to stop and assist in an accident and was driving at high speeds at the time of the crash.

So we moved in together in 2014, and got married in 2016.

She’s always been a slob, to the point where I find moldy, disgusting food on plates after pinpointing a foul odor(this would happen every week).

But in the pandemic, she started being the moral authority on COVID, and not letting me win even one discussion. We had to let all the food being delivered by Walmart/etc to our apartment wait on the shelves for 2 days until putting it away(which is fucking gross). She even was against my getting wine, because I had to go outside of the damn apartment to get it. When I let food sit for 46 hours, all hell broke loose.

So anyway, I get her pregnant at this time. She actually had me go downstairs to get the food into a cart. But then she stormed down, forcefully grabbing the food away from me(let I not triple wipe everything). During this process, she started bleeding and had a miscarriage. It was devastating.

Fast forward a couple of months, and we went with IVF. I bought with my own money almost a million dollar house to have some space with the kid. She said she’d pay for utilities and furniture, but then went back on her word.

So anyway, we closed on the house in Q1 2021. The work from home movement was still on full tilt.  We were sending the kid to daycare around our house. He and I were happy.

You would have thought she’d have moved her stuff out of the apartment, but no. She got another apartment in the city, and had a 2 month overlap. She had an asinine view that she needed to have it “just in case” her job says she has to go back to the office. And naturally, she pulls the kid out of daycare around the house, and brings him to a daycare on the city, even though I am strongly opposed. But what the hell, I’m just the guy. My opinion doesn’t mean shit.

So for the past two years, she’s been living with the kid in an apartment just for her job, and denying him the opportunity to grow up with space in nature like I did and enjoyed.

She led me to believe that her job was going somewhere, and she was helping me apply to other jobs that were interesting to me. That’s why I kept at my job, even though financially it didn’t matter vs my other ventures. Then I found out she was doing jack shit on it. Pretty soon thereafter, my job started a 3 days back in the office requirement. Then I decided to take a couple weeks of vacation, and said honey, here is where this needs to blitzkrieg it. She couldn’t care less. (By the way, I absolutely hate filling out job applications, as it constantly reminds me of past mistakes I already learned from and put behind me.)

So I decided to quit the damn job and focus on trading and other ventures full time. Made 5 years worth of the total comp in the job trading the next few months. She still looks at me with disgust and kicks me when I’m down.

She says her deadend job is so damn important and if she leaves without something else in place, she’ll never get another job and the world will end. I tell her ideas for what to do, but she screams at me what her bosses “would” say to her without actually telling them anything. She’s taking my son down and trying to take me down with her.

I’ve tried suggesting marriage counseling with her. I said I’d pay for it. She goes between it’s a waste of money, I can go by myself, and she doesn’t have the time during the week. Finally the last time I suggested it, she said I’d have to pay her in addition to the counseling.

Anyway, today was the last straw. I go to that apartment, and after a few hours get a fever and am laid out on bed. I tell her that I’m sick and hungry. She proceeds to berate me about having to make the kid’s food first, then feed herself, and then cook for me. Guess what happened? She ignored making my food, then berated me for having celiac disorder so nothing to cook. And then screemed at me for turning the heat up as I’m shivering. Then when I mustered all my strength to get something I bought in the freezer, she laughs at me saying I can’t microwave it. To prove her wrong, I try to find a bowl to put the food in, but they’re all filthy.

So anyway, I care about my kid, but only see him Saturday morning until Sunday morning(when she gets a babysitter in that apartment). I just can’t take  her abuse anymore, but want to have a relationship with my son other than what she deems acceptable. What can I do? I have a prenup and was good about segregating assets.

[https://twitter.com/aibm\_org/status/1752489423252381921](https://twitter.com/aibm_org/status/1752489423252381921)

&#x200B;

Richard V Reevers always has the same rethoric, ""We need to adress men's issues, otherwise they will vote for the GOP/Donald Trump/Javier Milei/Jair Bolsonaro/the right"" he litterally mention the ballot box thing

&#x200B;

He (pretends to) adress men's issues,not because how unfair discrimination against men is, but because if responsible people don't take those issues unresponsible people will do it

I guess he thinks he is very smart for saying such a vacuos sentence. But thats is nothing more than empty rethoric for NPCs.

Who are ""the responsible people""? Him? Why? Why is he the responsible one? Why are the other ones the unresponsible ones?

Just for the record, claiming that you are the responsible one and the others (MRAs?) are the unresponsible ones doesnt mean that you are actually the responsible one. 

You need to argue that buddy. But no one of the hosters who interview him (ejem Chris Williamsom ejem) will ever confront him ideologically for all his braindead bullshit. 

Richard V Reevers always tries to freak everyone out by saying that men speaking out for their (our) right is dangerous for women, they may end up voting for Trump.

Can you even imagine how many rights women would lose if Trump would ever get to be the POTUS?

The funny thing about all this ""pendulum efect"" is that has already happened.

Trump was the POTUS, Jair Bolsonaro won in Brazil too, same goes with Javier Milei or Yoon Suk-yeol  in South Korea, and women lost zero thousand zero hundred rights.

Yoon Suk-yeol didn't even abolished the conscroption system in South Korea, and this fucking idiot (Reevers) is screaming about how dangerous this pendulum efffect is. When women are actually untouchable and invulnerable in politics, there is no way to politician to be able to take back any right from women.

He knows that a granted (sured? i dont know which verb fits better here to mean something that is sure to happen) discrimination against men is much more bearable to society that and posible future discrimination against women. This is his playbook. 

&#x200B;

It's a real shame that people like Reeves are unable to see men's issues as a genuine topic to fight for, and men rights as something to wish, cheer and celebrate, and not to fear. 

I wish Reevers to talk about men's issues as he would do about women issues. I've never been heard sb to say that women speaking up for their rights (""rights"") its preoblematic because that may them vote for the ""wrong candidate"". Or that left not adressing women's issues is turn men more right-winger. Discrimination against women is always THE problem, a problem by itself, discrimination against men is a problem because that may give way to undesireble outcomes, but is never the actual problem. 

However i would like to stick up for Reevers, his nothing but the outcome of the historic moment he lives in. Feminism is not an ideology is a culture. And by ""culture"" i mean, is not like trying to learn Spanish is like trying to forgive it (for the ones who has the Spanish as native lenguage)

3: Most incels are harmless. If incels were the new jihadis, we would be seeing more incel motivated terrorist attacks. But we don’t see that. And yes, I’m aware of Elliot Rodger and Alek Minassian.

4: Incels hate redpillers and see them as cucks. If anything they hate the redpillers more than feminists do.

Hello Reddit,

I've been contemplating for the past 12h what to do and how to handle this situation. It was my fault for having unprotected sex and being promiscuous, and I get that. The woman told me when we were together it was impossible for her to get pregnant, we had fun for a few days and I had not thought much about it. I am now notified that she is pregnant 2 months later and that she wants to keep the baby. She told me that she is totally flexible to whatever I wanted to do since I never planned to have a kid. If I was to infer, I think she wants a kid and had told me she had a couple miscarriages before.

I think I had the closest thing to having a panic attack. Part of me wishes this had never happened as this wasn't planned. Idk if or how to break it to my parents the possibility of having a kid with someone I've only met a couple of times and whom I do not really know. Coming from an Asian immigrant household, I don't know how my mom would take it. I feel like my life is over. I'm turning to Reddit as it's the only way I can possibly talk about my feelings at the moment. I can already imagine all the judgement coming from friends and family. I feel so scared and alone right now. It's been hard to think about anything else at the moment and I've been holed up in my room.

I honestly don't know what to do, and am looking for any sort of advice.

Given your allegations that the attorneys were involved in corruption, do you believe your attorneys were influenced by the judge or someone with the knowledge and possible consent of the judge to fail to properly represent your interests?

If any judge or person exercising judicial decision making authority and subject to the judicial code of conduct (e.g. some Title IV-D child support etc. employees or Title IV-E child welfare employees who make judicial recommendations such as child placement, child custody, parenting time, or child support calculations), they may also be subject to complaints under this process, even if they are not attorneys. 

Judges are expected to abide by the judicial code of conduct for your state. Most states are similar to the model.

1707092573.0,The Men who Misandrists Fuel for their Arguments,"We know the statistics that most women are sleeping with the same small number of men. Women complain about narcissism, men not caring about their needs, getting treated like shit, getting played, cheated on, etc... Then they adopt a misandrist attitude and hate men because of what the small number of men they shared did to them.

These men are high-value men, pookies, chads, players, womanizers, big daddies or whatever you choose to call them. They are the ones that are damaging all these women and are the basis for these women turning into misandrists.

We know that these women are purposely choosing these men and getting played by them. Whether or not the woman is to be held accountable is unknown since she might only pursue the toxic assholes while treating nice guys like shit. However, these men damage a lot of women all on their own and it's only the top 20% of men or less. Not saying the remaining 80% are innocent, but less likely to be the ones breaking women's hearts left and right.

Why isn't there more action taken against these men? Women don't seem to make false accusations, assassinate their reputations, punch them in the face or hold them accountable in anyway.

And before you defend this group of men, remember that they are the ones that women cheat on their men with. They are the ones who pursue other mens women and make the woman see the man they're with as inferiors. They will destroy other men's marriages/families and make fun of those men afterwards. They glorify such evil for feeding their own egos. They aren't there for you, don't be there for them. If anything these serial homewreckers are as big of an enemy to the average man as this misandrist, western society.

Yes I am an envious man, but I never took any action to damage other men because of it. I have morals and boundaries unlike the men I envy.

1706989892.0,"Male SA Victim, Abuser Wants To Keep Child","So this is my first ever reddit post, i’ve seen a lot how the community can help people with problems. So I 24(m) am in a happy long distance relationship with 22(f). She’s across the country and we do a good job of communicating and seeing each other once a month. Before we became official I was talking to several women, once we became official, I’ve told those women explicitly that I am no longer interested and have a gf now. Most respected it and we put boundaries on our friendship, if kept. One of those women (21 f), who I should’ve completely cut off, openly stated she respected the boundaries but her actions did not support this. I knew this and stopped talking to her for months, after she convinced me she had changed I let her back in my life with boundaries. We typically never seen each other alone, and always kept it cordial. One night I threw a party at my house and invited several people over including her. I had a lot to drink as did most there (including her). I usually am very good with my liquor but tonight with me being at home I felt safe, something was off though, because I was very inebriated to the point where I could not do much for myself. i’ve never felt that way before and I knew this was not good for me so i went in my room and went to sleep. She later came in the room while I was sleep and i woke up to her trying to give me oral sex, I told her no and forcefully pushed her off of me, told her to leave and i went back to sleep. I later woke up to her being on top of me, by this point all of my clothes are off and sad to say my little friend has a mind of his own. for context, yes I am attracted to this girl, but I did not want this and repeatedly refused her advances. thankfully I had enough strength to stop it, as I try to go to sleep I do not remember much after that but waking up a little less drunk later on in the night with us both being naked in the bed. She knew I was too drunk to think much for myself or even fight back as much and completely took advantage of me. As a guy it’s hard to even consider this happening to you, but i had nothing else to believe. i’ve repeatedly told her no and for her to go against my request and proceed, i felt inferior. Something that I would never wish on anyone, part of me blames myself for even putting myself in the situation or how my penis could even get up in that situation. I don’t remember every detail of that part of the night but i think I came in her just based on stains in the bed. waking up and realizing what might have happened I demanded she leave which she did, after that I tried to brush is off but it still haunts me. she apologized and credited it to being drunk, but that meant nothing to me. i’m afraid to tell anyone because how can i as a man let this happen to me, why am i dumb enough to even have this person in my life. Realizing the worst possible outcome of what could’ve happened, i urged her to get a morning after pill, hoping that it would tie any loose ends that could’ve resulted from the night, but me unsure if i even finished, just thought it wouldn’t hurt to ask her to get one. thinking that my nightmare was over I quickly blocked her and hoped never to hear from her again. I never brought the incident up with my girlfriend as it would create a huge rift in our relationship. fast forward 3 weeks later she texts me that she’s pregnant and will keep the child and that there is no way she will not. what do I do? She says that i am the only individual who’s she’s been with for the past month, and I don’t want to act to late, so i’m looking for options now. Like do i go to the police, i have no evidence, and from my understanding it’s very hard for a man to prove this especially weeks after the incident. what rights as a man do I have for this? is this even illegal?",MensRights

1706981937.0,Going Against the Current as A Woman,"I try to give people the benefit of the doubt. Why not, right? We all have our own problems to deal with and you never know what exactly is going on in someone's life to influence them in the present. Naturally, this applies to everyone, but unfortunately, some don't see it this way. Some would rather plug their ears to anything that isn't blind agreement or condemnation of what they themselves dislike.

Full disclosure, I'm a woman. Throughout my life, the subject of gender influence in society became more and more complicated, and the tide became aggressive. Before I had a chance to form my own opinions, I was told I'm right. Before I'm given proper judgement, I was told I'm innocent. Before I could blame myself, it wasn't my fault. It's all so patronizing to be treated like I could do no wrong, and that I'm not responsible for my own actions and undeserving of being reprimanded for the problems I cause. Have I always been free to do whatever I want under full social protection? No, of course not. But far too many times when I feel like I'm the wrong one in an argument, someone's there to 'defend me.'

But there's a catch to all this: You have to conform. If you disagree, you aren't one of them. If you argue on behalf of men, you're part of the problem. If you don't mind being taken off the pedestal you never wanted to be on in the first place, said pedestal is destroyed and you never deserved it. Radicals exist everywhere, no group of people big or small exist without a few troublemakers and bullshit actions, but apparently, as a female, you either join the hive mind, or they'll turn their back on you. Suddenly being a woman isn't enough to earn their good graces when it was all that mattered prior to speaking out.

I was ostracized from one of my social circles after it came out that I didn't agree with most of their views on gender politics. It was a gradual, gaslighting phase-out where all of a sudden my messages are ignored and I'm invited less and less to calls and gatherings. I concede that there could be other reasons for the sudden shift, but their attitudes and the timing of it all seemed pretty clear on my end. It hurt because they were great friends, and I miss them dearly... but I'm not peer-pressured into despising men in totality, which is where the line is drawn.

Fighting against the patronizing words I've been told all my life makes me a traitor of some kind. I guess that makes me an outcast. Be loud and proud of your feminity, unless your opinion isn't the same inane bullshit, in which you can go fuck yourself.

There aren't many places for a woman to turn to when she disagrees with the majority opinion, and when there's a space to discover and discuss these concepts, your feminine membership card expires and your thoughts are valueless. It's a frustrating cycle, to say the least.

I'm sure not everyone here approves of me being here, and I understand that, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are plenty of us on your side in all this. I would never claim to have a harder life by any means, I hope it didn't come across that way. But regardless, just thought I'd share a little perspective from the other side. Best of luck to anyone dealing these physical and mental assaults to their comfort in their gender. 

TL;DR: There's an assumption that all women should agree with the majority opinion, and being ostracized or considered a 'traitor' for disagreeing is an unfortunate reality a lot of people have to put up with.",MensRights

1706938268.0,"Medically unnecessary circumcision is abuse, but when does it become trauma?","Many  circumcised men state they do not think circumcision is bad, it has no  effect on their life, sexuality, or world view. Their actions tell a  very different tale. When does psychological trauma actually occur?

The  vast majority of American men are cut at birth, they have no memory of  it. They grow up with this reality and it is normalized. This is where  the the common statement, ""you will never know any different anyways,""  comes into play. In this pre-cognitive state there is no knowledge that  the abuse happened, therefore there is no cognitive framing and no  psychological trauma. (Imagine a person that lived 500 years ago, their  spouse secretly poisoned them and they fell ill. They would not know  their sickness was caused by this betrayal, the poisoning never  traumatized them, only being sick did.)

Eventually  males become aware that something is wrong, they learn they are  circumcised, or they experience negative genital stimuli. The most  typical response is psychological minimization and avoidance. This is  when a man says its no big deal, and just never thinks about it again,  avoiding all of the emotional problems, and the resulting damage to his  world view that would come from it. The more a person compares  circumcision practice inconsistencies to acceptable ethical practices  the more a victims pre-cognitive state and avoidance coping are broken.  This is extremely traumatic.

I was  reading about the Four traumagenic dynamics model by David Finkelhor  and Angela Browne. There is this idea that I found very useful to  understanding the practice of circumcision, why people react the way  they do, and hopefully ways to stop it. They were trying to find ways to  explain the shame and guilt of sex abuse survivors which PTSD models  dont do well. The idea is that abuse is not an event, but a process.  People have to integrate this process of abuse into their mental  schemas, or world views. The coping methods circumcised men create once  they learn of their trauma may work in the moment, they may tell  themselves they like it, avoid it, then move on, but it doesnt integrate  with a world view that abuse is wrong and unacceptable to good people.  This is an important part. Sexual abuse survivors may feel shame and  guilt by being stigmatized and different. This is a psychological driver  that circumcised men have to perpetuate circumcision, and ensure it is  common.

The problems run deeper,  the more a victim thinks about this abuse, the more he uncovers the  horrors that are marked in his flesh, the more trauma he accrues, and  the more mal-adaptive and malignant his coping strategies become. This  can lead to complete breaks in the ability to logic and reason on this  subject, rejecting aspects of reality. Denying that circumcision is  amputation, denying that the foreskin is part of the human body, denying  that circumcision causes pain, denying that circumcision affects  sensitivity, denying that any man is happy being intact. Denial is a  powerful delusion that allows us to avoid anxiety, fear, shame, and many  other negative emotions. Most importantly it allows us to avoid  reconciling the entire process of our abuse with out world view.

First  do no harm. How does a man living in a country with routine infant  circumcision reconcile the very core tenants of bodily autonomy and  medical ethics. How does he reconcile the extreme betrayal by his  parents, the medical establishment, the legal system, and all the other  circumcised men in denial around him? Many people here will know the  especially cruel torment we experience, when we finally have the courage  to speak out about the trauma caused by the abuse of circumcision, only  to have our feelings completely dismissed. Then to be told that we  should be grateful for having been abused. Most men I talk to about  circumcision simply remain silent and wait for the topic to change.  Making sense of a world that values ethics so highly and still genitally  mutilates babies is extremely difficult and painful. It involves  creating a model that explains how people can so easily and routinely  violate the most basic and core ethic for the entire tradition of  medicine, and still sees people are generally ethical.

Trauma  comes from awareness, when people are not aware they cannot experience  trauma. Some people use this as a justification for withholding truths  and lying, ""Ignorance is bliss."" ""You can't miss what you never had."" If  we lived in a society where all forms of genital cutting were stopped,  and only the genuinely medically necessary procedures happened, then it  would be significantly more difficult to argue against someones willful  ignorance. As things are now, trauma is leveraged against victims to  keep them complicit in this cycle of abuse. Every new victim gives a  temporary relief to feelings of shame, and it adds immensely to the pain  and suffering in this world.

What do you think about the trauma circumcised men experience?

What are the typical coping strategies you come across that circumcised men exhibit?

Should  we validate and respect circumcised mens' mal-adaptive coping  strategies when they refuse to acknowledge and validate the trauma of  other circumcised men?

Or when their mal-adaptive coping strategies contribute to more cutting, or prevent efforts to stop this injustice?

I've been falsely accused before had to go to court in an all female court room and defend myself but was thankfully found not guilty and she showed up drunk. She also used to abuse me physically and mentally and lie and tell people I was abusing her.

1706917089.0,The Internet and it's obsession with women biases.,"I noticed a panel that referenced the ideological gap between men and women. They suggested that the trend of women becoming more liberal is associated with positivity whereas the break away from liberalism is a negative aspect for men.

I didn't believe what I've read because it's illogical to believe someone at their word. I decided to research this statistical claim.

I happened to have found that all of the searches I've found happened to contain the word 'manosphere' and not a single article considered it a good thing. Not one. All of them focus on a 'misogynistic' behavior pattern among men. They consider this to be a violent club of 'incels' who hate women excessively.

I began drawing comparisons to the feminist movement, as sources claim that it had its roots in a men's rights movement back in the 70's, which was considered a toxic response to feminism. It claimed that men who had similar ideology to the manosphere where violent against women and I wondered where they got that from. Just like how they claim that the men who are not liberal are violent, it make me draw comparisons to the feminist movement, where women filmed themselves pouring bleach on men's crotches. Except there is actually proven instances of the feminists turning violent.

Despite this, I looked up ""why when women get violent and/or unreasonable, no one speaks up?""

I get nothing and I mean NOTHING but article related to the abuse women face at the hands or men, the prejudice against women, the hatred of women in modern culture, how men are fragile and worried that women rising in ranks will depose of them.

Never once have I seen these same negative articles about women. No matter what search engine I use. And so it got me thinking...

Why can women disparage men? 
Why is article after article dedicated to painting men as the only possible monster women can face? 
Why are the standards women face the fault of men when most of their societal dilemmas stem from what their mothers (women) teach them at young ages conflicting with what they believe in as adults?

No matter where I've looked, there is no article that states things as they are? No man can raise his voice without becoming just another -ist.

Why does the internet fixate of creating the fiction that results in the friction between men and women when more than half of it would not exist otherwise? As a man, it is fatal to me to believe that women are less rational the more liberal they are because I have no outlet to say such a thing. I've dated women from the most conservative to the most liberal and I have experience to speak of, but even outlets where men can express themselves, unapologetically, is labeled as misogynistic and dangerous. Why?

On the Internet, if you have a penis, you are a pariah, even if you did nothing. You are forced to feel ashamed for thinking that men and women are not the same. You are shunned for looking at factual data gathered by men AND women that doesn't support a trend or a notion that pushed an agenda. You cannot say that the feminist movement is not what it used to be. It's dumb. It's the exact same as what the internet tries to pain the manosphere. If the manosphere are a bunch of women haters, why isn't the feminist movement not seen for as it is, a bunch of manhaters? 

They have the same motivation, just targeting a different gender if we play by the logic that the manosphere is a women hating movement.

I'm not even a member of the manosphere and I interacted with the members, who all seemed like a bunch of guys who do not buy into this red is blue and blue is red nonsense. They don't agree that women can do anything because, logically, they cannot. They are aware that they cannot do everything either. They seem to be the ones pursuing equality.

Don't worry about bias. I speak with liberals as well. I always ask, ""what rights do I have that you do not?"" I never received a response. We have the same rights. Liberals, imo btw, simply want advantages. 

Thus, these articles make absolutely zero sense to me. The internet is not a place for men. It is an echo chamber and propaganda machine for women. 

Even still it is disheartening to see this stuff.

TL;DR: The internet is full of articles that disparages men for standing up for themselves and praises women for engaging in the same behaviors they consider dangerous for men to have. I don't understand why things are this way, but it is very disheartening to see that men cannot be who they are without the disapproval of women and the individuals making internet content to push their agenda.",MensRights

1706861164.0,My Son is a Domestic Violence Victim,"My son is 27 yrs old. He was in a relationship with a woman for nearly a year. It started to go south late in the Fall, and since that time he was battered on multiple occasions. I’ll address a couple specific incidents so you understand the level of abuse.    

In one incident my son got himself ready for work and left the house. She must have heard the door close. She ran outside directly from the shower, completely naked, shampoo in hair, and started blocking his car with her body, screaming the whole time. She is irrationally jealous and accused that he wasn’t going to work but rather to see another woman. Once he opened the car door, she started punching and kicking him. He closed the door, tried to leave again. Blocked again. Called 911. Officers were dispatched. She admitted what she did, the blocking and the violence and told the officer she has mental health issues. No arrest was made. 

Incident 2 was this past weekend. Once again, when he needed to get going she attacked him. This time head butting, pulling hair and beard, repeatedly grabbing his legs trying to get him on the floor, kicked him in the genitals, scratched him several times, split his lip. There was some destruction of his property as well. She locked him in the garage. He couldn’t get out. He called 911. officers were dispatched. She was questioned about having someone in the garage. She admitted she did and opened the door. She also admitted the violence that my son had described to the police. She was not arrested on site. A detective contacted my son on Monday to know if he would like to follow through with seeing her charged, would he be a cooperating witness. The detective then advised he would forward the report to the prosecutor, who would decide whether to charge.    

There have been several incidences where she has punched him, slapped him, scratched him, destroyed his property, and blocked him from leaving the home. He has made 3 police calls in total.     

Let me say my son bears some responsibility because he continued to go back to her. Like most domestic violence victims, he loved his abuser and kept hoping that things would get better. That whichever incident would be the last time.    

I’m writing today because as a woman and a mother of a son, I never thought I’d see my child get caught up in the abuse cycle of domestic violence. Somehow I imagined that’s something you have to worry about if you have a daughter, but not a son. I’ve been an advocate for men’s rights since I found out I was pregnant with a boy 28 yrs ago. I’ve learned so much on the topic over these many years and yet this escaped me. It never occurred to me that my son would be a victim of domestic violence, even though I know it happens to men as well.     

What can we as a society do to encourage parents to talk to their sons as well as their daughters about the dangers of domestic violence?  I am fully aware that we have precious little in the way of resources for men who are victims. This is also something we need to address. But I’m just trying to focus on how we could make sure the parents are having the talk with and watching for the signs of abuse in their sons.    

I’ll just wrap this up by saying that I’m devastated. I’m brokenhearted for my son and what he had to endure. It very clearly was handled differently because the victim here is a male. My son had a very keen awareness that if he defended himself, he would likely be the one to go to jail. My son was given a victims rights sheet, but no information about a shelter, or a number he could call if he needed to talk to someone, or follow up from a special division within the police department that is devoted to domestic violence. There are basically no resources available to him as a victim of domestic violence in our area. As his mother, I just let him talk about his feelings surrounding all this as much as he wants. I listen and I validate that the behavior this woman showed him was absolutely wrong and unwarranted. It’s all I know to do. I’m open to any feedback about how I can support him.

1706845481.0,"Misandry Is ""Patriarchal?"" Ugh","Not that any meaningful or intelligent conversation is to be expected from someone on Twitter/X, but I just now saw an utterly ridiculous comment where this person was saying misandry is nowhere near as bad as misogyny is (blatantly false, it's real and just as bad and harmful, and unlike misogyny is never given attention or taken seriously). But get this... this idiot had the nerve to say both misandry and misogyny are products of none other than misandrists' favorite imaginary, non-existent boogeyman... the patriarchy. I'm beyond sick and tired and fed up of seeing and hearing this term thrown around and blamed for every issue facing both women and men alike, and feel anytime it's mentioned or evoked, the person who has done so ceases being someone with credability or integrity of any sorts. 

I'm sure the vast majority of people on this sub don't believe the patriarchy is a real thing. It's not real, while misogyny and misandry both very much are but the latter is never taken seriously and always treated as a joke, despite it's very real and harmful effects seen. Misandry is a major reason why male victims of violence, rape, abuse, trafficking, etc. are constantly marginalized or outright ignored (especially done by female offenders, which all occur so much more than people realize or want to admit to). It's a major reason boys do so poorly in schools and comprise the vast majority of dropouts, and also how infamously biased the courts and legal system are against them. Let's not forget how men still have to register for the draft and the notion of ""Believe women,"" which denies due process and again ignores the fact many male victims of abuse, rape, violence, etc. by women also exist in high numbers. It's also a big reason these issues always have to become a man vs. woman conflict instead of equally supporting both men and women, and equally punishing male and female offenders of these crimes as well. But misandrists themselves have shown time and time again that genuine equality and fairness and justice is not something they seek or want.

To claim the patriarchy exists and either deny misandry's existence or claim it's nowhere near as severe as misogyny or that the patriarchy is somehow responsible for both, BS. I don't believe the patriarchy is real for one second, while misogyny and misandry both very much are and the latter is far more harmful and malignant than many realize or want to admit to.",MensRights

I recently had a reminder this isn’t just true overall but also within other communities such as the outdoor community where another sub recently brought up a cherry picked example of a man harassing women in the outdoors, the article and sub of course using this to claim women face some huge risk backpacking that men don’t.   

Fortunately, there’s actually some good data on this showing that assaults backpacking occur at a fraction of the overall national level and that women are at no more risk than men are.  (1).   The risk to women is proven low, yet there’s a fear mongering push to claim the opposite.   

Yet, when I provide this objective information, I get hated on for it.  It’s incredible how people (and not just feminists) are so opposed to acknowledging women simply aren’t more at risk than men.   

Not only does this downplay the risk men face, but such fear mongering unnecessarily scares women away from things that are actually as safe or safer for them.    

People here may accept the facts, but we are sadly a long, long ways from getting society as a whole to objectively look at the risks men and women face.

1706741407.0,Rant: Women should be held accountable for their part in the sex trade since they are the majority of pornstars and prostitutes.,"But no, police just arrest the johns. They don't even close the clubs and arrest the owners. Just the johns! This is from an American perspective, a country with female generals and presidential candidates. Women can do literally anything at all except willingly enter the sex industry because they are only ever seen as victims.

Prostitution is a sexual offense but they are not required to register as sex offenders. Propositioning a prostitute is a sexual offense and DOES require sex offender registration. It's also a felony in some states.

In the states with backwards thinking like that, prostitution is far more widespread than in most other states. Texas, as an example, has red light districts that are highly active and moreso now than in any point in history. I work near one and there's hundreds of women standing on the street in lingerie every night working out of hotels and adult theaters.

I think this is a further attack on men's rights because men are only ever seen as the criminal. Men have been subjected to forced military service, incarcerated at a rate 10x higher than women have been, murdered and subject to violent crime at a MUCH higher rate than women, and had their rights violated far more often than women.

Women are creating this sort of social dynamic by continuing to prostitute themselves and make pornography instead of finding an alternative approach to live amongst men in society. They should shoulder an equal legal responsibility but do not with a legal system that's been blatantly misandrist and ""conservative"" for generations.

The simple fact of the matter is that studies have not been performed on female perpetrators. I tried researching federal statistics and they simply don't research female criminal behavior. There are countless publications showing women getting proverbial slaps on the wrist for molesting their teenaged students, even having their children, when a man in the same case would be spending 5+ years in prison or worse.

1706735668.0,Was Old Marriage Oppressive to Women?,"The always brilliant Karen Straughan gave an argument to prove feminism relies on chivalry for its success. But this argument also gave a fascinating historical look at marriage. This is a long read, but sooo worth the effort. Enjoy!  

Karen Straughan on the history of marriage and feminism’s reliance on old school chivalry. ""I don't like the idea that Feminism has always been so selfish and dependent on ""old-school chivalry right from the start"".""

You don't have to like it for it to be true. (Also, women were not treated like property or pets--the best legal descriptor of what women became when married was their husband's ward.)

The relationship between married couples was governed by a body of laws called coverture. When single, women were legally no different from men (other than that women could expect to be supported by their families even as adults). 

When a woman married, she gave up:

1) the right to hold property or income in her own name, any property or income was managed by the husband.

2) the right of decision (within reason), as her husband essentially became her legal guardian.

3) the right to enter into contracts in her own name.

In return, she got:

1) the right for her and any children to be financially supported by her husband. 

2) the right to live in the family home, and prevent him from selling it (dower rights).

3) the right to act as his legal agent and make purchases on his credit.

4) immunity from marital debt (even debts she brought with her into the marriage, as well as taxes owing on her property and income--liability transferred to her husband).

5) immunity from prosecution for some types of crime in some circumstances (the husband would be prosecuted in her stead).

Feminists of the first wave didn't like the things in the first list, and between the 1830s and 1860s (UK) managed to change them, into this:

1) she has the right to hold her income and property as if she were unmarried. It was not marital property, and the husband was legally prohibited from touching it. In fact, he had no power to even demand documentation of it.

2) she has the right to certain formal processes when, say, selling her property to ensure her husband was not coercing her to do so. (In the US this was called a privy examination)

3) she has the right to enter into contracts in her own name.

Everything she gained in marriage stayed the same, so what things actually worked out to be was:

1) ""What's mine is mine and what's yours is ours."" This is quite different from giving her equal access to and authority over the joint marital property. 

The husband was still expected to pay the taxes owing on her income and property, but could not exploit that property or income in order to pay them, nor demand documentation of it for the purpose of tax calculation. If she sold a piece of property or used her income to help support the family, or even to purchase necessaries for her own use, she could sue him for reimbursement. 

She retained her right to purchase goods on his credit. During legal separation and/or divorce, only a maintenance agreement filed in court could absolve him of this liability--even before the property laws changed, women were known for racking up huge debts on their ex's credit in order to strong-arm a better settlement out of him. Courts at the time did not see it as sufficient that the man put out a public notice that he would no longer honor such debts--he literally had to go to every store and inform them in person to stop selling things to his wife on his credit before a court would uphold it.

She could sell her house, even if it was the marital home, and even if her husband objected. She had the right to kick him out of a house she owned, but he had no such legal right to kick her out of a home he owned (this was legally considered abandonment).

She kept her dower right to a ""life interest"" in his real property, and he still had to secure her permission to sell any house he owned if she had ever lived in it. That must have been fun, given the whole ""law of agency"" thing, if the wife was leveraging her access to his credit to put the pressure on, while simultaneously refusing permission for him to liquidate any of his real estate assets to cover the increasing debt.

She kept her right to his financial support for herself and her children. When the custody laws changed to default mother custody in the second half of the 19th century, this meant divorcing couples went from ""dad gets the kids because dad pays for everything"" to ""mom gets the kids and dad still pays for everything."" 

She now had the right as a married woman to enter into a contract in her own name, but remained essentially immune from any legal liability to repay a loan. (Incidentally, this led to another feminist complaint in the 1960s--that lenders were demanding a male cosigner when women wanted to get a credit card, mortgage, etc. It was very unfair, they said, though most people did not realize--and feminists weren't that keen on telling them--that lenders did this because there was no way to force a woman, if she was or got married, to repay the debt. They wanted to have someone to hold responsible for it and have a gander at his income, assets and credit score.)

Anyway, this situation (where only some of the body of coverture laws were dismantled) led to one incident in 1910 in the UK where a schoolteacher named Mark Wilks was imprisoned for tax evasion when his suffragette wife (physician Dr. Elizabeth Wilks) refused to pay her income tax. Given his comparatively modest income, and the fact that he was solely responsible to pay all the other bills, he argued that he was almost certainly financially incapable of affording to pay the tax owing on her physician's salary. Not only that, but she had refused to show him documentation of her finances so he could calculate how much to pay. The judge didn't care, he was put in prison. The law would not allow the judge to order Dr. Wilks to pay the sum owing out of her own money--it was Mr Wilks' legal obligation to do it, even if other laws prevented him from being able to.

Dr. Wilks then went on an interview tour in the news media, urging other suffragettes to do what she did, as part of a ""no vote, no tax"" activist campaign, claiming that their husbands--if they were good, decent men--should be happy to serve the prison time to draw attention to the unfairness of men having the vote while women did not. After the media outcry, part of which involved publication of his failing health, the courts stayed the sentence and released him. He died a few months later.

Meanwhile, in New York that same year, a suffragette lawyer, Mrs Harriet Johnston-Wood, wrote an op-ed in the NYTimes decrying the unfair laws governing marriage. First, she argued that women should be able to contract with their husbands to be paid a wage by him. Well, guess what? They already were able to, if the husband agreed, at which point any money he paid her would become hers and hers alone as if she were single. I suspect Mrs Johnston-Wood was decrying the fact that this was no legal requirement for husbands to pay their wives a wage for their work as housewives.

However, there was no way, even by mutual agreement of the husband and wife, to legally absolve the husband of his obligation to support the wife. That obligation was not a contract between the parties that could be nullified by their mutual consent, but was essentially a husband's obligation to the state (otherwise known as a law).

This suffragette also argued that the laws around custody and guardianship of children were unfair to women. Despite the law at the time describing mothers and fathers as equal custodians and guardians of their children in nearly every sense, and subject to equal authority and responsibility. The most significant exception was that the property and income of any minor children fell under the legal authority of the father alone to administer. Because only the father had any financial obligation under the law toward the children's support, he retained the sole right to manage their money.

And yet here was a suffragette complaining that this situation was unfair. NOT the part where only the father has any financial duty toward his children (even if his wife is wealthier than he is, mind you), but the part where the mother doesn't have equal authority over the incomes and assets of children toward whom she bears no financial obligation.

And please, keep in mind, that feminists managed to get ALL of these very one-sided changes--changes that removed wives' traditional obligations to their husbands while maintaining all of the husband's obligations to his wife, handing the privilege of custody to mothers while maintaining the sole obligation of fathers to support their children--they got all of this done in an era when women did not have the vote, where only men could be judges, and only men could be legislators. They had no formal political, legal or economic power to bring to bear on the men who would eventually give them everything they were asking for, regardless of the handicaps it would place on men.

I’ve made an observation that women in their 20s to early 40s tend to treat the average guy like crap, even in public. 

In college and in the corporate world I have met hundreds of young women. They all follow the same MO - use the smart men to help them pass classes and skate by at work, and fawn over the attractive men all while complaining about how all men are scum. A lot of them don’t even acknowledge your average Joe when walking by in a hallway. No “hello” or “good morning”. Just stare at the ground or pull out their phone. 

Over the years you hear the sayings “you go girl” and that she’s a “strong, independent woman who don’t need no man.” But you know deep down that if it weren’t for men, she wouldn’t be where she is today. In the corporate world, I’ve seen first hand that companies will have a top goal each year to put 51+% of women in manager/director roles. It’s clear discrimination against men, but either nobody thinks about it that way or since men are viewed as second class citizens today, nobody cares. 

On a personal level, it appears that a high percentage of these young women are disasters. Sure a lot of them may be good looking, but they appear to be incapable of letting themselves be guided by intelligence rather than emotion. This is why so many of them appear to be passed around by the attractive and maybe not so “good” men, and then continue to wonder why.

Typically I hate making sweeping generalizations, especially at a scope this large, but it’s very difficult for me to meet a woman and conclude she is different. Usually doing that is a sign of low intelligence, but I’m fairly confident on this one. It makes me wonder if women were always like this deep down but the feminist and sexual liberation movements over the years have helped show their true nature.

There was about 1,5k comments under this, and most of them were... Well, stories of ""first sight"" of a dick and agreeing that they are ugly. I am still convinced that this was all a joke, but I still googled this issue. And, apparently, I have uncovered a previously unknown to me layer of Internet misandry. And I CARE.

There appears to be a lot of one-sided debates on how ""ugly"" and ""not aesthetically pleasing"" male genitalia is. It's mostly here on Reddit, but it's sometimes addressed elsewhere. Turns out, penis is considered a disgusting thing by majority of peoples in the web, INCLUDING straight women. Some of these comments still seem more like a joke, while most of them proclaim that **yes dick is ugly,** and some go even deeper into the well-established (well, at least in the West) fact that female body in general holds a visual superiority over male's, and considered such by both men and women (which is a whole other topic.

Now, some do point out that vaginas aren't aesthetically pleasing either, and there is actually a number of posts saying the same thing about female genitalia, but comments under them are noticeably different - suddenly there is much more people saying that all genitalia are weird, that the poster is wrong, and -- the best thing -- that *dicks are uglier.* So there is a huge difference when roles by some chance happen to be reversed.

I personally extremely care about it. First - I refuse to believe that there is something inherently unattractive about penis. Second - **I plain feel self-conscious** about it now, simply because I happened to see this sentiment and I'm not sure where it stems from. And third - this issue is not addressed. At all. I mean, it's quite possible that Google doesn't understand my search requests (as it often does), but aside of that it seems like researchers are not interested in this subject, despite it being so seemingly popular.

Is there some hidden agenda against male genitalia? For vaginas we have symbolic paintings of flowers and designer clothes. For penises we have speculative ""symbolism"" of ""phallic objects"" that was made up in XX century. Or is it male body in general? Who knows. But it hardly should be that way.

I'm sorry for ranting, but it was certainly not a good reading before going to bed, and I had to put it off my chest somehow. After all, dicks as class are weird and ugly, and I happened to be born with one. And it looks like there is no one around who can assure me that I'm wrong thinking like this after I fell into this strange rabbit hole.

Just these past couple weeks, a colleague I thought I was cool with started giving me the silent treatment. She never responds to emails from me, even if my email is to HELP her with something. She just ignores it and continues on. She asks for me to help her take on work fairly often when she feels too busy (despite getting paid MUCH more than me) and I never have to ask her to take on work. Yet when I sense she’s struggling and try to help, she acts like a bitch. 

Interestingly, a lot of these women are late 30s/early 40s, have constant drama with their relationships (I hear their gossip about ex boyfriends), and seem like a mess on a personal level. But it’s ok, let them all make 150k and treat their male coworkers like trash.

I made a post asking for help in dealing with caregivers who were overly controlling, but because I mentioned having a boyfriend, half the thread just could not stop talking about him. Because I am physically disabled, the commenters went off about how he's a predator and toxic and stuff, and when I said he was none of those things I got insulted and attacked too. 

It frustrated me because **I ACTUALLY KNOW HIM** and these strangers who know literally only two details about him - age and gender - kept trying to lecture me on who he is and wouldn't accept my actual first hand experience. 

I talked to my boyfriend about it, and he just said ""yeah, that's what it's like"". He talked about how that's just the way society is. He talked about how men are constantly seen as predators and even socially pitted against each other by society, so it becomes very socially isolating. He talked about how exhausting it is to just exist around women because he always has to be hyper aware of how he is scrutinized like a wild animal. 

I think it's safe to say nobody in my life has ever seen me as a threat. I could never understand being treated like a villain like that constantly. 

I've experienced ableism and sexism, and sometimes I don't even know if the way I'm being treated is because of my gender, wheelchair, both, or neither. It sucks having to be on guard all the time. But I have so many support systems and he has none.

Musk is a businessman who is creating jobs and searching for ways to create new technologies. 

Recent headlines about these two people are interesting. A poll showed that 20% of Americans would vote for Swift's endorsed candidate. Another headline mentioned Musk is working on a technology that could help paralyzed people reconnect nerves to the brain.

If Elon Musk was a woman, imagine the praise and positivity that Musk would receive in the media. A woman creating jobs and pushing for science and technology! Reminds me of the great press Elizabeth Holmes had (before he scam was discovered). 

If Taylor Swift was a man, imagine how much hate Swift would receive for the lyrics and actions by the pop star. This would also be a good comparison for Beyonce. Switch the genders on Swift and Beyonce and they would be hated and called incels. (This makes sense if you swap their genders as well as the genders of their song lyrics).

However, I watched a video recently where he discusses solutions for education and found one of his points to be such a monumental step back for boys in something called ""Redshirting"" the boys, where he suggests we have boys start school A YEAR AFTER GIRLS  since boys' brains develop more slowly, so that way, they are developmentally closer to being peers with girls in the classroom.

I'm quite baffled that someone like Reeves who studies the vast inequalities of males to such an esteemed degree can conclude on such a far-fetched, unfair, and downright insulting 'solution' that plays straight into the gynocentric reality he's supposedly against. He claims that this is a good idea because some private schools tend to do this by default, but I still fail to see how this is in any way a good idea based on any real insights.

EDIT: to clarify I'm suggesting this as part of a men's rights platform or manifesto (if such a thing exists), not suggesting individual MRAs should do this. My point is that it could be a good way to show what the men's rights movement stands for - positive masculinity, against misandry and for equal rights and support for men's specific needs (e.g. mental health).

In the case of the twelve-year-old boy from the Waldviertel, who is said to have been tortured by his mother for weeks and locked in a dog crate until he fell into a coma and almost died, the prosecution is ready. The child's 32-year-old mother has to face the jury for attempted murder, among other things, her lawyer Astrid Wagner confirmed at the KURIER's request. In addition, it is also about the torment and neglect of immature, younger and defenseless people.

The mother's 40-year-old friend and accomplice has to answer for being an accomplice in the trial at the Krems regional court. However, there is no date for the hearing yet.

The judiciary, criminal police and the authorities pursued the plan to keep the matter under wraps until the trial. The matter only became known because the mother filed a fundamental rights complaint about the pre-trial detention imposed on her - and was dismissed.

The unimaginable sadistic acts on the child are well documented on thousands of pages through various photos, chat logs and a partial confession from the mother.

Um, it’s called supply and demand? People have tried selling sex to women. Women didn’t buy it. Even among the few women who are willing to spend money on these things, most of them (regardless of their orientation) would rather look at other women.

Besides that, it stereotypes that all men like the same things, which isn’t really true.

1706418344.0,Misandry in the Media 01,"I was just watching a show I watched as a kid because it was widely available on cable.  Now that I’m older I view things differently and missed this as a kid.  The show is iCarly. Season 4 episode 7 to be specific Nora (female) is a crazy stalker and she’s got the hots for Freddie.  She sexually assaults him by kissing him although he explicitly tells her not to.  This happened twice throughout the series, this is just one of the occurrences. Below I will link both.  Furthermore, you’ll see that every other character in the scene just stand around and watch as if it’s funny as the laugh track plays.

All in all, this show which was made for children rated PG-13 played male sexual assault and a young man getting stalked all for jokes.

Needless to say, female sexual assault is never played for jokes in this same exact kids show. 

NOT TO MENTION, on season 4 episode 9 Michelle Obama makes an appearance and they security detail said she’s “higher” up than the POTUS. 

ALSO, T-Bo, Spencer, and Gibby are all portrayed as idiots while Freddie is a stereotypical loser who gets bullied by a chick (Sam) the entire show.  Meaning, all the prominent male roles in this series are portrayed in a negative way. 

Also, the female cast in the show also used the term man up a lot throughout the series, code for suppress your emotions and move on.

Well, duh, that's how gender-based discrimination works. Men are not going to be treated the same as women are because they're not women. There are certain beliefs of each gender which is why there are specific laws against each gender.

Very common examples feminists pull out, like the fear of walking home alone at night, or fearing for your safety isn't even gender specific. Feeling scared of your safety is different than actually being more likely to have your safety compromised as a man.

But when they pull out laws against women they're not even present in the US. Like, ""you're not oppressed because there is not law that men can't drive,"" even though that law is gender-specific.

Good

Kambria Darby was arrested in Byram, Mississippi after her 2 year old son needed paramedics' attention for 'freezing & shaking.'

Darby has since compared herself to Jesus in a Facebook post, saying she was being ""done like Jesus was.""

The boy was taken by Child Protective Services and later released to a relative with his two siblings.

Darby is facing up to six years in jail if she is convicted for neglecting her child.

Darby claims she did nothing wrong.

""They did Jesus the same way, he felt sick to his stomach as well; he didn't want to go through it.""

""My village ain't gone play about my 3 & neither do I! Again I can't say everything it's a legal matter but my kids are not a charity case, they are not neglected, and I am not mentally ill! Stop it with the defamation!""

1706372838.0,Marriage...,"I've been thinking about this for some time. I remember looking at my grandparents, parents and aunts and uncles at a younger age and thinking, sure would be nice to be happily married when I'm older.

As time has went on and I've had plenty of relationships, I've found it something I would never do now and elaborate on this further.

So my question I'll put to you is - 

Why would men want to get married in modern society?

For me, I can't seem to think of one logical answer for that question. As it stands, men gain nothing from marriage. 

If a man decides to get married to a ""modern"" woman, then he stands to lose everything and gain nothing. Divorce being the key reason why I believe this. As man we have no worth to a woman unless we can provide them (in their view). So men work hard, they work their asses off, for a nice house, nice car, full refrigerator, nice ring and whatever luxuries are desired. If (especially due to no fault divorce) a woman decides that she no longer love her man or she cheats, then that man who has worked his ass stands to lose everything. 

Another reason some might argue is to have kids. Well if you decide to have kids with the wrong woman then your rights as a husband and father are next to none in Western culture.

Negating the kids part of the argument, if you don't have kids and go through divorce you still have to pay alimony to your ex.

Where is the incentive for men to get married now?

I could also argue, that in Western culture for the most part women don't do wifely duties. They don't cook, clean and some are even not good parents.

The fact that marriage is supposed to be a commitment and a part of the religious institution is lost also. Most people my age (33) or slightly older or younger, are not religious also. 

So my argument is. Unless men get protected better rights, women show they are willing to perform wifely duties and there is a basis of commitment to god (whatever God you follow, I don't discriminate), then men shouldn't be getting married. As we stand to gain nothing and lose everything.

This is just more of the usual BS deflecting of issues affecting men and enforcing the ""women most affected"" narrative that does nothing but divide both men and women, and continue to trivialize or even ignore real issues affecting men. 

I'd say men still being forced to register for the draft, lack of due process for potentially innocent men falsely accused, society's failure to recognize and condemn female on male violence/abuse/rape, etc., how badly boys do in schools, the ""women and children"" narrative (with ""children"" really referring to girls) and of course how infamously misandrist the courts and legal system are, I'd say these issues affecting men are pretty damn systemic and continue to go ignored and unaddressed because of the ignorant train of thought that men supposedly have it easy and things are much harder for women. Not saying women have it perfect in life but there's so much in the way of aid and services for them, and both misogyny and violence against women are constantly recognized and condemned (and rightfully so). Contrast this with men having next to nothing in the means of aid, people denying misandry exists and how little attention and condemnation violence against men (especially by women) frequently gets (or doesn't, rather).

It's so infuriating and irritating to constantly see this kind of deflecting from issues affecting men, by claiming supposedly anything affecting them isn't ""systemic"" even when there's so much evidence it actually is. Just like you can't convince some people there's a fire even when it's burning out of control and they're set ablaze and burning to a crisp, you can't convince people of systemic and societal problems affecting men even when presented with hard evidence.

1706299029.0,How do I make a good argument against alimony?,"I am in favor of abolishing alimony. My argument in favor of that position is as follows; 

Signing a marriage licence is considered an agreement to take the risk (though not necessarily a guarantee) of having to pay alimony, only because the system was designed that way. That which was socially constructed can be socially deconstructed. As it currently works, if you wish to get married and you do not want to have to pay alimony in the event of a divorce, you have to get a prenup signed, which specifies that no alimony will be paid in the event of a divorce. Some people feel awkward asking for a prenup, because it sounds like you expect the marriage to fail. If one person feels that the expectation to support your spouse should end when the marriage ends while the other person wants to receive monetary compensation following divorce, the latter is the one who should be placed in the awkward position of having to talk to a lawyer and get a contract signed guaranteeing that you will get what you want in the event of a divorce. That is because the latter is the one who feels entitled to someone else’s money and the former is the one who believes that you should have to stay married if you want to continue receiving support from your spouse. 

The above paragraph appears to be a valid argument against alimony. However, I feel like the argument needs something to mak it stronger. Is there a good argument? An analogy I could bring up?

So basically feminist call men ""Dogs"" and they always want sex and can not control themselves.

If women have low sex drive compare to men then why do average women (No sex workers) have higher body counts compared to men ? 

Okay let's assume that women are only sleeping with Chads / Top 20% males , but still they are not sleeping with the same Chad but changing the partners.

If men have high sex drive then why body counts for men are very low ? Couldn't men hire many prostitutes for a high body count ?

Don't say that men are rapist because most women rape to but get away with it , the American female teachers are a big proof.

If men have high sex drive then why so many men in their 20s are virgins but women are not ? 

If men have high sex drive then shouldn't men make a society where it would be easier for them to get sex ?

She cites some study that showed incels and men in general overestimated women's value of looks or status or underestimated their value of kindness or intelligence or something. Problem is: this is self-report. So the women's self report can mean they have no self-awareness. Certain things can be subconscious. Most people like to think they're not superficial. Not just that, but overestimating women's value of it doesn't mean it says women didn't value it a lot. She cited another study also showing self report, and then this [one](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Franco-Simonetti/publication/340068405_Sex_Differences_in_Mate_Preferences_Across_45_Countries_A_Large-Scale_Replication/links/5e7568b792851cf2719a3e9d/Sex-Differences-in-Mate-Preferences-Across-45-Countries-A-Large-Scale-Replication.pdf?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19), which still shows women value financial prospects more than men. Then she said they value ""some"" importance which means she now contradicts herself. She also cites a pew research survey showing that when respondents were asked what they think society values the most in men, they picked honestly/morality the most, and financial success is second. Problem is: these people aren't asked what they personally value the most in men, but what they, whether they're right or wrong, think society values the most in men.

She also talks about the male breadwinner myth and how it's post-industrial revolution thing. this is true. historically, women did work a lot and so did children, and the extended family took care of the kids because of extreme poverty. Once society richened in the post-industrial era, breadwinners were a thing, but it wasn't because society hated women and wanted them to be miserable by not letting them work. The book The Privileged Sex elaborates on this.

The thing is: a cross-cultural [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/1474704919852921) here found that no, women's valuing of wealth and resources or physical looks did not vary enough by country, and wasn't less common to value wealth in ""egalitarian"" countries. But she argues women only valued wealth because she wasn't allowed to work.

She then goes on about how she sees dating coaches, and redpilled communities and all that shit encouraging men to be rich and shaming them if they ain't. Problem is: why do you think that is? It's because women value that in a man. Society's expectations for men and women often are rooted in what the opposite sex values. So that's why men try to be rich, because they have to be given benefits by society such as a relationship, being promoted, being treated respectfully and getting ahead in life overall. But she then says this shit:

>But if you're a man who uses money to get women, you don't get to complain that women then use you for money.

Moreover, women do value wealth and earning potential in a man. Some of these studies are self-report, but it's true: women, especially unmarried, young and childless women, [often value men who can provide for them](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Febs0000084). Even this Washington Post [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/12/in-experiments-researchers-figured-out-what-men-and-women-really-want-in-a-mate/) elaborates on speed dating studies and other studies finding that women value men who grew up in rich areas and are less satisfied in marriages where she earns more. Even this [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103106000345), which doesn't rely on self-report directly asking how much they value wealth, found that yes, women valued wealthier men with higher socioeconomic status.

But this feminist says men become rich to impress other men, which is laughable because if anything, men resent rich men, not high-five them. If men praise rich men, maybe it's because they fit the expectation people have, which people have because men had to be rich to help women support a family, which according to The Privileged Sex, was expected of men way before the breadwinner model. Women had to work, children had to work, but women had to spend a lot of time childrearing than men because that's why the wage gap even exists, and women had to start marrying young to start reproducing to populate the Earth, and they were broke at that age. Of course women were evolutionarily hardwired to value wealth in a man.",MensRights

""Dustin Toth, 26, of Windsor, has been exonerated, but not before losing his job and nearly losing his military career.

A Weld County jury on Thursday convicted Katherine Bennett, 21, of the false rape report that she filed in November. Bennett had accused Toth of kidnapping her at knifepoint in Windsor. She claimed that he drugged her, held her captive and sexually assaulted her.

What actually happened on that night, Toth says, was a consensual night with a woman he thought was a friend.

'It was a pretty low moment. I really wanted to throw myself off a cliff,' said Toth, who could have spent his life behind bars if he had been convicted of the charges he faced. He had a clean record up to that point.

Toth said the situation alienated him from his family, cost him two jobs and prevented him from getting an apartment at one point.

'Somebody turned my whole world upside down, quite literally,' he said. ""I've been wanting to stay in a hole, but each day I somehow gain the strength to get outside my door, get on the Internet, and look for a job.

Now that his accuser has been convicted, Toth is hoping to move on with his life.""

As a matter of fact there has been a surge of violence with eight such incidents in the past two months alone.

Colombian gangs hire beautiful women to lure the men in so they can administer a date rape drug.

Today, I came across the same stories being spread on women's communities. They called them ""Passport Bros"" and ""Sex Tourists,"" to begin with, despite the fact that these men met those women on dating apps and their intentions for the dates were unclear. What was most shocking to me, though, was that the women seem to be celebrating this:

>FAFO in action. All these popular passport bro countries are usually some form of rough and you have moron incels going over there acting like they have big swingy brass balls. I’m not a fan of “he/she deserved it” but this is just common sense!

>I'm a woman and I have been to Colombia twice and everyone I met was lovely and I really enjoyed it there.  Keep being great, Colombia! 

>Oh they died? Oh no. Oh well.

>So sad, too bad... anyway, Colombia is a beautiful country.

>Oh no!! So anyway, what's everyone having for lunch?

The lack of empathy is downright psychopathic. Imagine if a woman went to Jamaica, where she were lured to a hotel bar, drugged, robbed, and then murdered, with her lifeless body being left on the street. What would these women be saying if men laughed at her and victim-blamed her?

As a 29 F with conservative values and lifestyle, I often think about different problems that our society is facing. 

Firstly, I want to say that I do not support modern feminism and believe that men's rights are more undermined in our society. Also, as a woman, I feel like feminism has, to some extent, made my life worse. But this is another topic :).

Nowadays you can often hear that abortion is a woman’s right. Personally, I don’t agree with it  and believe that it is a violation of men’s rights. 
Women do not agree with me, but I would like to know men's opinions about my point of view.

I believe that abortion should only be done if there is written and signed consent of the man and woman. 
I understand that many argue that until 12 weeks the fetus is not considered alive, but given that the fetus appears there thanks to male cells, then the man has the right to speak even in the case of the fetus.

If, for example, a man wants a child and a woman does not, then without the man’s consent one cannot have an abortion, since it is also his future  child.

1706088060.0,Societies financial/success expectations of men IS their version of bodily autonomy.,"I’m very tired of seeing constant talk of how unfair sexual expectations of women that men have and how gross and disrespectful it is.  Yet women’s constant economic/success expectations are just “preferences”.  

Work is what we are doing with our bodies.  Especially with the type of work men do (and whether it is paid OR unpaid, as men do a lot of dangerous and/or dirty jobs in their homes as well).  Women expecting their partners to pay for them, take care of them, or even protect them, is an issue of bodily autonomy.  

Especially in an equal society, with women making more money than ever before, the lack of ability to recognize this aspect of men’s bodily autonomy reeks of male disposability.  Despite that we’re not seeing gender expectations not changing for men by women, and I would argue it’s getting even worse as more and more men are being deemed economically invalid romantic partners with women making more AND wages stagnating.  I think many men could be in a much better place if socially and romantically they weren’t punished so harshly for these struggles and these aspects of their autonomy were recognized.   

I see too often in life where men are rejected because of their financial expectations, exacerbating the societal problems men have, and people writing it off as “incompatibility” via values.   And while I can agree that can happen, in an equal society it mostly just feels more like entitlement to what men’s labor.",MensRights

She goes to the clinic and is like ""do I have to use my husbands sperm""? The doctor says no but is like uhh what? 

Then the two girls go on what could only be described as a cum shopping spree looking for 'the one'. She uses this sperm to impregnate herself.

(FTM Trans Male),"Hello, this my first time ever posting in this specific subreddit as an 20 year old young adult FTM trans male (pre-op & pre-hrt) and I wanted to ask a kinda personal type of question to my fellow gentlemen that use this subreddit related to whether or not I am unaware or too ignorantly naive on the certain privileges that regular females tend to get as opposed to the differences of social treatment that most regular males tend to get in society.

And here's my first question: 

Would I be indirectly/involuntarily missing out on any kinds of special treatment or taking that form of special treatment solely based on being regular woman/typical woman (without any kind of sex related dysphoria in general at least) for granted that will no longer be prevalent in my life if I were to be recognized officially as male throughout the rest of my life especially socially & statistically?? 

And then I have a second question:

What are some of the underappreciated forms of privilege of being a woman or lady that I would be missing out on if I were to be eventually be seen as a male or be capable of blending in as a male to a certain degree within society/my social environment in general??

Hopefully these two questions weren't too bizarrely weird or extremely complicated to answer since I am just genuinely curious and open to knowing what thoughts any of you older or younger men have if I would be much less likely to be treated positively or nicely (such as being seen as more of a threat in some areas out in public) since I am also an African American negro racially and I am not quite sure how drastically different I would be treated by others if I were to be automatically considered to be a black man throughout the rest of my livelihood once I eventually start taking hormones much later into my 30s or 40s.",MensRights

The next afternoon i  asked if she took the pill or not and she said yes. Two weeks later she tells me she lied and never took it.

I was deceived, trapped and lied to by a lying, manipulative, psychotic woman. She basically trapped me to get herself pregnant it seems. I don’t want to feel like a deadbeat or a coward.

1705979248.0,My predictions about the future of sex technology due to the sexual power inequality between men and women,"Throughout human history, men have always overcome adversities through the power of technology and surpassed what nature provided.

1) horses were surpassed by automobiles

2) fire was surpassed by electricity

3) you can even argue that the invention of writing and language, well before the printing press, led to the augmentation of human brain by compensating for the short term memory span of the human brain (this is from Yuval Harari's book) 

&#x200B;

It is a well known fact that billions of evolution gave women & female mammals superior sexual power over men due to the difference in the reproductive cost. 

In the modern world, social media  and online dating have made it near to impossible for most men to find love. This will challenge men to come up with better alternatives, as we have in the past through the power of technology. 

I believe that by the end of this century, men will surpass the sexual power that women hold over men and in the longer term.

This is my prediction of how the sex technology will involve in the next 100 years and how well it replicates real women - there are two different metrics 1) sexual gratification 2) companionship.

companionship is technologically much more complex to replicate and likely will not be surpassed until we completely reverse engineer human brain and become transhuman, but 1) is much simpler problem.

Remember that horses are still much more complex than cars in terms of engineering complexity -> horses consist of trillions of cells that self-replicate. they have consciousness and their own complex thought process that surpasses those of dogs and cats. but cars replaced horses because they surpassed horses in a very specific subset of tasks that they were needed for - transportation.

Likewise, while it is technologically near to impossible to create an android companion robot that has the human woman intelligence and autonomy (which I predict will not happen until 2100s), the technology that will surpass a subset of tasks that certain group of women perform - which is sex work , can be replicated & surpassed much more easily, and by limiting the problem to that specific subset of tasks (having sex with a human woman) the engineering problem becomes much less complex than having to create an autonomous female robot with human level intelligence.

  
Without further adeu, this is my prediction of how the technology will evolve to replicate & surpass the problem 1) - fully replicating & surpassing the experience of having sex with a human woman.   


== from the past to today (2024)

1) magazine porn  - it replicates 5% of the goal 1)

2) VHS porn - it replicates 10% of the goal 1)

3) 4k internet porn  - it replicates 30% of the goal 1)

4) 8k vr porn with fleshlight - it replicates 50-60%  of the goal 1)

== future

5) light field VR porn - around 2030 & with fleshlight - it replicates 70-80% of the goal 1)  
\- we will have light field VR porn - where the viewer can move around within a given sphere -> a natural progression from the 8k  vr porn with the resolution requirement of 16k-32k.  

6) torso doll synced with passthrough model of a pre-recorded human being performing different positions or a CGI rendered character  => it replicates about 90% of the goal 1)

\- around 2030-2035. 

torso doll will have sensors embedded within the skin that syncs with the VR/AR goggle. it has sensors & positional tracking so it can react to your movement - when you are about to penetrate, or looking at the doll from different angles, it will be able to say certain things to increase the immersion. 

&#x200B;

7) robot doll synced with passthrough model of a pre-record human being performing different positions -> around 2040 - 50, this is the point where human sex work will be killed, just like automobiles killed horses.

\- a robot doll with animatronics head and the ability to switch & move positions within the context of replicating sexual acts, synced with a 3d model of any real human or rendered character, with the ability to replicate all sex positions and acts will become available. 

&#x200B;

far future (2050-2100) -> this is where we become more metaphysical and begin to start challenging problem 2) -> surpassing the human companionship provided by a real woman

=============

around 2050-2070, we will have an interactive volumetric video - unlike static videos of today, where you say something to a youtube video and it won't respond, in the far future, when you wear a VR/AR glasses or contact lens by then, and when it displays a volumetric video of a real life scene you captured, let's say you have a memory recording of you interacting with your crush at school or in the office. in real life, you just had to say goodbye or just walk by, but in the interactive volumetric video captured passively via advanced holographic imaging of the future, you replay the memory, say hi to her, ask her to go to the bar with you, or even to the bed with you. you will be able to fulfill your any fantasies, and you will also be able to sync this volumetric 3d rendered ai interactive model of your crush with the doll mentioned in the previous step

&#x200B;

around 2070-2100 - this is when the human-level ai is likely going to be achieved, and we will have westworld level robots with the same intelligence and capability as an adult human woman, but with the ability to provide companionship to you. 

&#x200B;

As I agree with Yuval Harari, our desire for intimacy and companionship is just a sequence of neurological signals that modern technology cannot fully decipher but will be cracked by the end of this century. if you can reverse engineer and fully understand the inner workings of the human brain to individual molecular level, you will even be able to decide to turn on/off or fulfill that sequence of signals (algorithms) that produce your desire for companionship and intimacy. this will likely happen after the westworld robot stage, sometime in the 22nd century, when humans start to merge with the machines and take the path to become a transhuman cyborg, by then, just like we consider the desires of dogs and cats as inferior, we will look at human sexual desire and companionship as something of lower dimension and will probably seek higher orders of things, whatever that might be that our current monkey brain cannot comprehend.

Basically their motto is that they claim to help men but it doesn't come from a place of genuine care for the men, but for the women. They think solving women's issues will solve men's issues and that men's issues were only caused by men so it's their responsibility to be good people for women. It rubs me off the wrong way.

Let me start by saying I think all humans naturally tend to see things from their perspective first. I’m trying to see things from the male perspective and wondering if anyone here is open to seeing things from a female perspective? I’m genuinely curious about where there’s a middle ground, where we can both mutually benefit the other, leading to a better world. Depending on whether I get down voted to hell (don’t care) without any useful engagement ( I learn something or share something that helps) perhaps I’ll inquire further.  I have no interest in tilting at windmills, I have interest in becoming enlightened. 


So: I hear men get a bad deal in divorce. I think this has been traditionally (mostly) accurate. Men’s rights groups have exposed inequities in the system that are now attempting to be mediated. If they do the following would it then seem fair to you?

1. Custody is 50/50 unless someone is a danger to their child by DCF removal criteria.

2. Child support is determined strictly based on the number of days spent with each parent, irrespective of sex, based on a formula with the income of each parent calculated along with metrics (childcare costs, number of children, Medical expenses..).

This is how it works in Florida. You don’t type gender into a child support calculator and get a different result based on male or female.

If you disagree why?

3. If a parent does not exercise visitation child support is adjusted based on who actually has the child not who is slated to have the child. If a father or mother for whatever reason (too busy, can’t be bothered, drug or alcohol addiction) is not actually taking a child they shouldn’t get the benefit of reduced child support without the responsibility of feeding, clothing, and caring for said child. 

4. Alimony is based on a formula derived from earnings, length of marriage, and factors such as one party putting the other person through school making them therefore more valuable. 

It should be temporary and rehabilitative irrespective of whose paying unless it’s a long term ( grown kids who someone gave up their career to raise) marriage where a spouse gave up their career to stay home. SAH dads should get lifetime alimony If they entirely gave up their careers and now they have grown children.

Feminists like to project that we live in a patriarchy as they like to say men overall have more power. 
The common refute I use is there are more female voters and thus choose who is elected.  

Now I don’t have anything to cite but from what I see women seem to be far more organized and support one another more than men seem to.  This bothers me but I understand why it is true.  

Then we introduce the internet and social media where most on the world spend significant time and where any physical power that gives men any advantage is stripped away absolutely.  So you have many small groups of men and individual men vs large groups or organized women who primarily want to support other women or at the very least see men as scary and on one or many levels the enemy. 

Social media is in the crosshairs frequently with people critics for anything and everything that’s going wrong.  Election interference, terrorism, crime , misinformation. You name it.

For instance some EAs will say that malaria is a big issue that kills about 450000 young children that could be solved in part by [giving people at risk insecticide-treated bed nets](https://www.againstmalaria.com/) (you can prevent a case of malaria with $5 and prevent a death with $5000). Or that factory farming is bad for animals and it could be solved in part by [improving welfare standards for animals](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/). And so on.

I was wondering if the MRM can do something akin to what the EA community does, i.e.:
1. Conduct research into the issues men and boys face around the world and write detailed reports (like [this](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/naTwu3xD3WFWu5fbp/global-lead-exposure-report)) about them (i.e. how many men and boys around the world or in specific countries have spent time in prison or had a worsened reputation due to false accusations, what drain does IPV against men have on the global economy and QALYs, what interventions can we implement and fund, what is the cost-effectiveness of those interventions, and so on for all the other men's issues).

Whenever you bring up that female on male violence and abuse also exists (which it most definitely does and in much higher numbers than believed or known, or many are willing to admit to), besides getting the usual rebuttals of how to stop silencing women or that male violence against women is much higher and at ""epidemic"" levels and thus a bigger priority, misandrists sometimes claim men being violent to women is a systemic problem and the other way around is not a concern. 

I mean WTF, how delusional are these people? They act as if men all over were born hating women and want to disadvantage and harm them as much as possible. So much of the West goes the extra mile to prioritize the rights and welfare of women and girls including always bringing awareness and activism to the subject of violence against women and having campaigns about it, and what's done for female violence against men?

It's just more misandrist victimhood nonsense and another way to deflect from the equally real and prevalent issue of FVAM and to trivialize it and make it a not serious or pressing issue even though it absolutely is.

1705870382.0,How men are harassed into marriage by Indian law ...,"*Prior to delving into the content, it is crucial to acknowledge that certain aspects in this discourse are presented in a legal context, which might seem intuitive to some. However, this articulation is essential for comprehending my perspective and why I deem this law as both archaic and biased against men. The objective of this post is to express my viewpoint on why a democratic nation such as India should refrain from maintaining a law of this nature, deeming it unconstitutional and susceptible to rampant misuse. As always, I invite constructive criticisms and open debates on the subject matter*.

In India, there exists a legal provision wherein a woman may provide consent for sexual intercourse under the condition that the man will marry her in the future. If the man reneges on this commitment, he can be charged with rape. The inherent flaw in this law is not only its susceptibility to misuse but also its contradiction with legal principles. Enforcing a commitment to a future event such as marriage goes against the constitutional right of individuals to have the opportunity to withdraw from a marriage contract before its actual occurrence.

Marriage, being a lifelong contract, should not be compelled or mandated in legal terms. While it is reasonable to pursue civil suits for expenses resulting from a broken promise (in presence of proper evidence that such costs were actually incurred) , **criminal charges** for reneging on a marriage proposal are unjust. Individuals should be entitled to change their minds regarding marriage without facing criminal consequences.

Furthermore, sexual relations should be based on genuine consent rooted in love or, alternatively, within the framework of legal prostitution where one party is compensated monetarily for the act. The court of law should not consider a promise to marry as a valid consideration for providing consent to engage in sexual activity.

If individuals engage in sexual relations out of love, the legal perspective should acknowledge that both parties are mutually consenting due to their 'past positive experiences'. This consent is a result of their desire to please each other based on their shared history, **with no guarantee that the relationship will persist in the future.**

Lastly, casual encounters or friends with benefits (FWB) arrangements are solely intended for momentary pleasure and should not be construed as indicative of a long-term commitment. These relationships are transient by nature and should not be subject to legal consequences beyond the immediate context of their occurrence.  

Now, let us discuss the potential misuse of this law. Analogous to provisions within rape laws, instances have arisen where a woman's assertion – specifically, that a promise of marriage was made, hence leading to her consent – serves as evidentiary support without necessitating a thorough investigation. Consistently, **the responsibility to establish innocence lies squarely on the accused man**.

Numerous instances have come to light involving allegations of blackmail in connection with these cases.",MensRights

 People think the deconstruction of a man is some loud, violent  occurrence. This outpour of bitterness towards the world, and in  reality, the deconstruction of a man is a silent film, a common surgical  procedure that the world didn't know it was trained to do.  


The  breaking of a boy is the world's quietest natural disaster. As a man,  there is no such thing as being stuck between a rock and a hard place;  you either use the stones at rock bottom to build a way out or you get  buried by them. Ain't nobody coming to save you; the entire world is  trying to construct you into its perfect little image, and the people  around you are the ones who fuel the process of your manufactured  masculinity.  


Some of us are going to make it through assembly,  but we need to watch out for our defective counterparts because the  whole world is going to use their flaws to define all of us. Luckily,  the most effective product is aware of its own shortcomings and tends to  destroy itself given enough time alone with its imperfections.  


This  abridged explanation of the process is how you become a man or a  monster. Everybody knows what a monster does, everybody judges the  monster, nobody questions its creator. Some of us are manufactured to  make light of our peril with jokes, if you will.  


Male comedians  are magicians in this way; how they take their pain and airbrush it into  something laughable. He He, Ha Ha. Joke about a failed suicide, the  crowd laughs, the curtains close, the comedian drinks all the way home. A  man's tears are just funny that way, how they have to be translated to  be accepted, how they have to be transcribed into an art form to be  worthy of observation, how you have to bleed artistically to become a  worthy topic of conversation.  


Funny how we can joke about a man's  misery, but nobody taught the boy to cry. But they taught him how to  fight, nobody tucked him in at night, so he doesn't sleep at night.  Nobody offers protection to the protectors, nobody provides the  providers with provisions, nobody looks after the overseer, nobody has  ever tried to guide the man who steers. Everybody judges the weak men,  nobody checks on the strong ones. Only other men know how subtle a  difference before the transition.  


Nobody taught the boy to cry,  so he would do it at all the wrong times: in the barber chair getting  casket sharp, remembering the funeral of a failed relationship in the  grocery aisle, breaking down because he's weighed down by the tears  collecting in his baggage at a soccer game, remembering what it was like  to be a boy running towards a goal.  


Most men will only  experience unconditional love from their mothers, and some of us don't  even get that. Most of us have never even felt appreciation or respect  without conditions or hidden intentions. We don't know what it sounds  like to hear, ""I see you, and I'm proud of you. I'm glad you're here.  You really make a difference."" Yet the expectation is to constantly be  displaying the strength and love that the world is hesitant in  conveying. We're expected to have a thick skin but get judged if it  turns to a hard shell.  


The first step in being a man is ignoring  the hunger because, yes, boy, you're gonna be starving: starved of  attention, starved of affirmation, starved of love, starved of being  told that you are enough.  


Step two in being a man is  comfortability with replaceability. You are only as good as you are  useful, you are only as valuable as you are needed by others. Should  there ever come a day, boy, where you fail to provide everybody with a  smiling face, then do not be surprised when they say, ""All men do is  take up space,"" and you are swiftly replaced.  


Step three in being  a man is overcoming your fear of the fire because almost everything you  will ever try to build will go up in flames: relationships, careers,  hobbies, and yes, you are always to blame.  


Step four in being a  man is understanding by the time you finally get all the right answers,  these questions will have already changed. You might achieve the  strength of Herculean fiction trying to balance the weight of all these  contradictions.  


""Be a man,"" they say, definition unknown,  description keeps changing. We men so empty, so irritable, so this, so  that. We get told what we are so much, we've accepted that who we are  ain't even up to us. The blame is always on us, regardless. One guilty  man's actions require an innocent man's explanation, otherwise, you're  all guilty by gender association.  


There are four times as many  male suicidal ideations because it's been hammered in our head that  we're falling short of our societal expectations. Imagine being in a  world of hurt for a hundred different reasons during a nationwide  emasculation season. There is a unique brand of sadness that follows  being hated without reason. It ain't no secret: while over 30 percent of  us have attempted to stop breathing, nobody even mentions the men who  have succeeded.  


As the saying goes, every failure is one step  closer to a successful attempt. There is no such thing as an attempted  suicide; a man's soul dies long before his body has a chance to realize.  A man with an old soul is just a boy who contemplated going ghost. For  every woman that suffers the same fate, four men will follow her to the  grave. And I try to hide the stats from the poet because he might  romanticize them, he might mistake this tragedy for a love story. He  might write a poem in place of the suicide notes that were never left  behind because nobody taught him otherwise.  


So who's going to  teach these boys to cry while they're still alive? A man with nothing to  lose will view everything as something to take. A child that isn't  embraced by the village will burn the village down, and he will stare as  everything that didn't love him back contorts and cracks. He will ease  his way into the fire until he finally feels some warmth. ",MensRights

I do the laundry, but I leave the folding to her.. she says that FOLDING clothes is harder than washing said clothes. I clean up her beauty room, by sweeping the floors without a thank you! Which I don’t look for it, I understand some days it’s hard for her due to the baby. 
Yet, she says I don’t do ANYTHING, around the home..she’d like for me to go grocery shopping, wash and fold clothes, cook, while also taking care of the baby while she works Tuesday-Sunday, she used to only work Thursday-Sunday, but she had to change her schedule, due to my mother being sick. Which she went ahead and our daughter, in daycare 2 DAYS after my mother was in the hospital. The daycare is 550, a week which for me? It’s honestly too expensive.

1705704320.0,Alimony should be abolished,"Remember, alimony is different from child support. If a couple breaks up and one person gets custody of the child, it makes logical sense for the non-custodial parent to be forced to pay child support to the custodial parent. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/17rqus8/if_legal_paternal_surrender_is_a_good_idea_does/ 

Alimony is money you pay to your ex-husband/wife. This can happen, even if you never had any children. 

I believe that alimony should be abolished. 

Here are my reasons. 

Reason #1: If the expectation to continue to be home maker ceases after a divorce, then so should the expectation to be a bread winner. 

Imagine a lesbian couple (let’s call these women Judy and Erica) get divorced. During the marriage, Judy was the bread winner, while Erica did most of the cooking and cleaning. 

After the divorce, it is likely that Erica would NOT be compelled by court order to continue cooking for and cleaning up after Judy. Therefore, it would not be logical for Judy to continue supporting Erica financially. 

Reason #2: Being paid by your ex-spouse after the divorce is like being paid by your employer after losing your job. 

After losing your job, your former employer is not required to keep paying you. Therefore, after a divorce, you should not be required to keep paying your spouse. You may be thinking that severance pay is a real thing. Let’s keep three points in mind. 

Point #1: 

Severance pay is not required. 
https://www.google.com/search?q=Severance+pay+is+not+required.&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=Severance+pay+is+not+required.&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yDQgCEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgDEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgEEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgFEAAYhgMYgAQYigXSAQczMDVqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 

Point #2: 

Alimony has no time limit in some states. Depending on where you live, you can be required to pay alimony for the rest of your life ( https://www.cga.ct.gov/2014/rpt/2014-R-0036.htm#:~:text=Connecticut%20law%20does%20not%20set,indefinite%20or%20lifetime%20alimony%20order. ). In the state of Florida, there is a law that says alimony can last no longer than half the length of the marriage ( https://www.tampafamilylaw.com/divorce-family-law/alimony-spousal-support/florida-alimony-bill/#:~:text=Mid%2DTerm%20Marriage&text=Just%20like%20a%20short%2Dterm,paying%20ex%2Dspouse's%20gross%20income. ). Even at companies where severance pay exists, it is never the case (that I know of) that severance pay can last a lifetime or even that it is required to last half the amount of time you spent working at the company. 

Point #3: 

Comparing alimony to severance payment works, only if the person who initiated the divorce is the one paying the alimony. If the person who initiated the divorce is the one receiving alimony, that is analogous to your employer being required to pay you even after you have quit your job. 

Reason #3: You could get a job and receive governmental support in the meantime. 

Alimony was created in a time when women had very limited job options, and so alimony was just about the only way for a divorced woman to make ends meet. That is not the world in which we live today. Today, women account for almost half of the work force ( https://www.bls.gov/blog/2017/12-stats-about-working-women.htm#:~:text=Women%20are%20Integral%20to%20Today's,three%2Dquarters%20of%20the%20workforce. ). 

If you are unable to work, then you can and probably should receive disability benefits. If, however, you are capable of working, then just do that. You can receive welfare benefits in the meantime. Universal Basic Income also sounds like a pretty good idea ( https://youtu.be/kl39KHS07Xc?si=EIhJYmknnX6_I0FO ). 

Imagine that your spouse asks you for a divorce. You get down on your hands and knees and beg your spouse not to divorce you. You make every promise you possibly can to change and improve the marriage, but your pleas fall on deaf ears. 

In this situation, if your spouse has to receive government benefits in order to make ends meet, you will have to support your ex-spouse through your tax dollars. However, every tax paying citizen will have as much financial responsibility to your ex-spouse as you do. This makes logical sense, as every tax paying citizen had as much say in the decision to end the marriage as you did. 

Reason #4: For as long as alimony exists, you could be rewarded for destroying your marriage.

If the lower earner cheated and that was the reason for the divorce, it would not be right to force the higher earner to pay alimony to the person who destroyed the marriage through infidelity. 

Gold digging has always been a thing. There have always been people who value others exclusively for their money. Alimony takes gold digging to a whole new level. Not only is the higher earner valued exclusively for his or her ability to provide financially, the higher earner is more useful to the lower earner after the divorce than he/she ever was while the couple was together. 

Reason #5: If you were abused physically and feel you are owed reparations, those reparations do not need to take place in the form of alimony. 

The argument in favour of alimony that may be on your mind is physical abuse. If you abused your spouse physically, then you should be forced to pay reparations. 

Obviously, being forced to pay reparations to someone you have abused makes logical sense. This does not need to take place in the form of alimony. I am pretty sure there are laws that allow you to sue someone for assault. 

Reason #6: If you wish to receive money from your spouse following the divorce (and especially if you want it to be mandatory) you should ask for a contract that says so. 

If you decide to take time off of work so as to make sacrifices for the marriage, you know that being divorced and no longer having monetary support from your spouse is a real possibility. You ought to get a contract signed stating that your spouse will have to support you after the divorce, if that is what you want to happen.",MensRights

1705668802.0,Men are opting out.,"So I've noticed a massive change in myself, I'd say over the past 4-5 years. I've pretty much opted out of society and I'll elaborate on this further.

I used to be in a long-term relationship with a woman, that pretty much went ""emotional terrorist"" on me for years until enough was enough and I walked away from her and I've been single since.

After the break-up I was angry for a long time. Mostly at realisation that I had given everything and received nothing but abuse over the years.

So I decided to walk 15 miles a day along the coastline of where I live in Scotland and actively go to therapy (which I saw through to the end)

Now that I've given a brief description of what my situation was for context, my question is:

 ""Do you believe men are opting out of society because of toxic Feminism and the behaviour of modern women on general?""

I feel I've opted out. I'm fit, well educated, contine to expand my knowledge through academic reading and I'm mentally healed through therapy...However, I don't interact with others now. I'll be civil if I'm forced to be, but I won't open up to others (especially women).

I went from being very extraverted and outgoing to almost a complete recluse. I'm not putting this all down to Women and their dangerous/toxic behaviour, I'm also throwing it out there that Politics plays a massive in this also. I'm Catholic and Conservative (I don't bible bash or lecture, just my beliefs politically and in God). 

I feel that my beliefs also make me want to Opt Out of society as to me it's pretty grim and bleak. I try not to judge, but it's hard not to when the Degenerate Behaviours are rife which I attribute mostly to Neo-Liberalism/Feminism and Misandrist Attitude towards men.

""A Grade 11 boy at Kriel Hoërskool, Bafana Sithole, took his own life by hanging himself with his school tie in a school classroom storage on Thursday morning November 17, 2022.

Some of the Learners indicated that Bafana did this after a female friend tried to charge him with a false rape accusation. It’s reported that the girl filed a case with the police three months ago.

We've witnessed this before with the case of Lufuno, who was bullied to the extent of her believing suicide was her only way out. This case may be different, but the effect is ultimately the same. A 17 year old boy who had his whole life ahead of him took his life because of an alleged rape accusation made by a fellow classmate of his. The nature of their relationship may not have been revealed, but the repercussions of her words that were ""just a joke"", as she claims, are the loss of life. 

Our aim is not to have this young girl punished for her words, but to bring awareness of the impact that her words have caused. A life was lost. How many more lives have been ruined by such slanderous accusations? It has become so easy to accuse someone of rape that a single accusation made by a female is believed without basis or proof and innocent men receive hard judgement, jail time, and in this case death.

But as usual, this gets brushed aside or even ignored to enforce the ""women most affected"" narrative that's been so heavily ingrained in society for so long.

Not even so much as a Christmas card or birthday gift, nothing. She has rights to contact and visit to maintain a meaningful relationship with then, but hasn’t even attempted since not getting her way in their divorce. Their divorce was strung out and messy to say the least. She’s on antidepressants and antipsychotics (too many facts to share) but the common denominator is because of a TBI she received while working. She continues to lie about my husband and make false allegations that she was abused when there’s proof she had been the abussive one,but charges kept getting dropped because she’s the woman and continued to lie and gaslight everyone. The tipping point of their divorce was she kidnapped the children and fled to another state, he spent lots of money to find them and through his lawyer legally have them returned all with officers present. But the police never filed anything or did anything about the kidnapping because “he had his children returned”. after 10 days where nobody knew where they were and returned with marks on their bodies. In this state she falsely obtained a protective order by lying about her safety. In a later proceeding to have it appealed the judge told him “it’s her interpretation and you’re a veteran and a man who looks scary so I’m going to keep it in order”. No proof, no nothing you can’t make this up. Now he’s being accused of violating said protective order by the DA of that state for sending an email that she needs to pay her vehicle and owes money because she refused to refinance it under her name which was supposed to be done after their divorce and she refused to do. The judge told him he “could” contact about legal communication directly because she refused to legally change her address from their old house which he received in the divorce and his lawyer was CC’d in said email. But the DA will not drop it and wants to convict him of DV over this. This cannot only ruin our lives and buisness but adversely affect our children.

> “It doesn’t seem fair to me that a man has to take financial responsibility for a child until they are 18 when he didn’t want to have them,” Lemoine said in a radio interview on Tuesday. The bill that she plans to present gives women two weeks to notify the father that they are pregnant : “The woman, when she finds out that she is pregnant, has 15 days to notify the father and the father can decide if he is going to be responsible for the child or not.”

>  “Since women have the privilege of killing their children and giving up being mothers, why do men by law have to keep a child because the woman perhaps told them: ‘Yes, yes, come [ejaculate] inside, I’m on the pill’ or she punctures the condom,“ Lemoine argued. ""Many women do these things to reel a guy in and take advantage of him when he’s in the heat of the moment, my grandmother told me about it,” added Lemoine",MensRights

1705573816.0,What is society's crippling obsession with friendless/single men? Why would such demographic live rent-free in most people's heads?,"**Now I will get this outta the way by prefacing that this doesn't legitimately bother me on a personal level, in fact the older I get the more I truly appreciate my own solitude and company and try not be clingy on friendships/relationships for void sake's, however this phenomena has always intrigued me for sure and it says a lot about how society basically mis-instrumentalizes men's socialization into contemporary society**

&#x200B;

Now onto the beginning of the rant: I find it fascinating and oddly intriguing that for most society single/friendless men are seen as these people suffering from arrested development, as if men need somehow need to company of others to be worthy of respect, honor and decency

&#x200B;

What gets me even more intrigued is that somehow society acts like male entitlement when it comes to their affairs is even a thing, when most aren't even allowed to vent out of their loneliness and atomization AT ALL

&#x200B;

But this is where I suspect society is mis-instrumentalizing men's socialization

&#x200B;

Let me elaborate and explain: Men are seen as being needed of domestication, being civilized of their way of being, basically the idea that without society's influences men are incapable of being sociable and easy-going people to be around

&#x200B;

TFM even talked about this and brought it up in one of his videos basically stating that men's masculinity is always seen as inherently dangerous unless codified by the nurture of society, is a deleted video unfortunately so I cannot link it right now, but basically the whole point is without the nurturing forces of society men are incapable of being seen as civilized human beings 

&#x200B;

I believe this is where the sensationalist trope about how all incels and socially-outcasted men eventually turn to become mass shooters and terrorists, and you see this trope heavily reinforced in sjw/feminist circlejerks too

&#x200B;

The funny thing is socially ambitious types in both genders can actually as secretly dangerous around their environments considering their undenied ability to blend in into social environments much easier and quicker and thus be able to manipulate their people into petty social contracts

&#x200B;

Bryan Johnson is a biotech CEO famous for spending millions to meticulously reverse his age was accused of walking out on an ex-fiancée after a breast cancer diagnosis and serially cheating on her.

According to a breach of contract lawsuit filed in Los Angeles in 2021, content creator and actress Taryn Southern alleged that entrepreneur Bryan Johnson obsessively controlled aspects of her personal and professional life.

He spent 2 years fighting horrid false accusations of his ex fiance who had tried to quietly blackmail him into paying her 9 MILLION fucking dollars to not ruin his entire life.

The boy gets arrested on two felony charges, for possession of child pornography and manufacturing child pornography.

But the worst part is this: the prosecutors issued a warrant to take a photo of the boy's erect penis as evidence. How to they plan this? To take him to a hospital and give him an injection to cause an erection, then to photograph him and compare it to the sexting video.

Also, no charges have been filed against the girl, even though she sent naked photos of herself. 

And how is this not considered the police producing child pornography?

I’m not saying women should need to register as sex offenders if their rape case turns up nothing, I’m saying they should if there’s evidence they made it all up. I’m prefacing with this because this is really hard for some people to understand. 

I believe lying about rape is a sexual offense. If peeping on someone is a sex crime, if peeing in public is a sex crime, if lying about STDs is a sex crime, then lying about sex to ruin someone’s life is ABSOLUTELY a sex crime. 

The point of the registry is to warn people against those who are sexually dangerous. I’d say men have a right to know if their potential partner has lied about a sexual encounter in the past.

Can you imagine this father, found guilty of raping his 11-year-old daughter, and what life in prison must have been like for him? Can you imagine, police, social workers, judges, all being taken in by the lies of a 11-year-old?

This is not an isolated case - if you put in a search engine - father falsely accused of rape - page after page comes up. And these are the cases that were discovered because they could not be hidden since the main witness admitted that she had made it all up!

Then don't generalize about women yourself.

If you don't like how men are labeled as violent brutes and rapists, then don't label women as lying and manipulative harpies yourself.

If you don't like how some feminists and some women distrust all men cause they were raped or abused or are afraid to be raped, abused or killed. Then don't distrust all women yourself like every single one of them is out there looking to destroy men in some way.

If you don't like how some feminists ask women to stop dating men or having sex with them cause she thinks that men are abusive rapists. If you think that they are sexist and crazy (and they are), then don't tell men to stop dating or having sex with women cause they are all lying 'whores'' who will all destroy your life in a whim too.

And no, this is not a ''concern troll'' or a ''shill'' or whatever stupid term that some people here want to shout at everyone who they don't agree with.

I'm genuinely concerned about this sub and this movement, we are beginning to grow and be herd, and some sexist and misogynistic mothefuckers want to use this chance and jump on the wagon to spout their sexist bullshit to a bigger audience. 

And the only ones that they will be hurting in the end is men and this movement. We are sometimes having problems to have people listen and agree with our message that we are disadvantaged in some fields and that we are lacking some rights.

So do you think that people will listen to their stupid and sexist bullshit? No. They will disregard them **and** any man who would want to speak about men's rights. They will lump us all together cause those sexist turds are using this sub, this movement and our platforms to spout their mysogynistic bullshit. 

And the problem is that in many cases, they are upvoted. Especially whenever the topics of marriage, sex or dating comes up. Then they come in herds and you see all the sexist generalization about women being upvoted to the top sometimes.

We should watch out, cause not only this sub will lose any credibility we already have, this sub may be even quarantined or banned.

r/theredpill and r/braincels are quarantined, and they are getting way less traffic the last time I checked them out. They have to go somewhere, and this sub is one of the biggest subreddits about men in this website.

THE CHARGES HAVE BEEN DISMISSED!!

First and foremost, I want to thank this community. In December when I wrote my original post I was at my wits end.  My life was falling apart and I was having suicidal thoughts. At that time I had no one to talk to and felt completely alone. The outpouring of support lifted a massive weight from me. Many of you messaged me directly to express your concern, offer help, or share your similar stories. I honestly believe posting here on r/mensrights may have saved my life. One user, in particular, was a massive help. He contacted me via DM and told me he had gone through something similar quite recently. He was kind enough to tell me his real name, and a simple google search brought his sexual assault case up immediately. He gave me his number and spoke with me on the phone for several hours, which eventually lead to me hiring the same attorney.  The attorney’s name is Antoinette O’neill, and if any of you find yourself, or someone you know in the situation I was in, I can’t recommend her enough. [https://parlatorelawgroup.com/content/antoinette-quinn-oneill](https://parlatorelawgroup.com/content/antoinette-quinn-oneill).  

The amount of sexism and discrimination I felt through this whole process can’t be properly related in a reddit post. The US Military has essentially given women a get out of jail free card when it comes to sexual assault allegations, however absurd those accusations may be. My accuser has been protected at all costs. The “investigators” tore apart my life. They interviewed co-workers, acquaintances, ex-girlfriends, friends, etc. Anyone who they felt would help them prove my guilt, they spoke to. When I was originally informed of the accusation, I was told it was the investigators job to find the truth, to collect facts, and allow JAG to take things from there. When I received the Results of Investigation Report, or ROI, what stuck out immediately is investigators never once interviewed any of the “victims” friends, family, co workers, ex-boyfriends, etc. They never attempted to ascertain the validity of her claims. She told a minimum of a dozen people about the assault, including her chain of command, and not a single one of them was interviewed. They simply came at me from every conceivable angle. They interviewed people I had not seen or spoken to in YEARS. The sad truth is, if they had investigated her absurd claims, they would have discovered the truth in a short amount of time. Instead, the process took a full YEAR to complete because they never once attempted to confirm a single aspect of her story. As an example, she claimed that she could not accurately place where the sexual assault occurred. She simultaneously claimed to have used a ride share app to leave my residence and travel home. Those two statements together make zero sense. Yet they never once asked her to show the ride share app receipt, history, or contact the ride share app company for documentation of the travel. HOW IN THE FUCK DID THEY NOT ASK THAT SIMPLE OF A QUESTION!? That should have been extremely easy to produce if the statement was true. If they had, her entire story would have begun to fall apart. It was absolutely infuriating.   They interviewed anyone they could find I had contact with to see if I had ""confided"" in them about ""what I did"".  Their exact words when interviewing one of my friends.  Meanwhile, they didn't interview a single one of her friends to see if she had confided in them about the assault or any of the lies she told.  How the fuck is that not discriminatory?

After a full year of no word and my administrative hold, I was informed that JAG felt they had enough probable cause to charge me with the sexual assault, among other more minor crimes associated with the assault, and we moved onto the Article 32 hearing. This is where my attorney embarrassed the prosecution and easily ripped their remarkably weak case apart. For those unfamiliar, the Article 32 is sort of a pre trial for military members, which a 3rd party official oversees the charges and decides on their validity before proceeding to court martial. Since I refused to speak with law enforcement without an attorney, it was my first opportunity to refute the charges, show any evidence I have in my defense if I so chose too. The officiating officers’ job is to analyze both sides and decide what charges should be taken to court martial.   Due to COVID very few people were physically present in the room. It was mainly done through video teleconference. The prosecution attempted to explain and justify their bullshit charges, which included a lot of “ummm … “and rifling through paperwork to answer questions from the officiate. It was obvious they were ill prepared and inexperienced. When it came time for Toni to speak, she ripped their case apart in a matter of minutes without once looking at notes, needing to look up or reference precedent etc. She flat out embarrassed them, and in that moment, I knew she was worth every single penny I had to pay for her representation. Afterwards, I realized how I must have looked on camera while Toni was ripping them apart, cause I was staring at her in awe of her abilities. I was being charged with a life ending crime and I had a giant shit eating grin on my face watching my attorney work. It’s one thing to be told someone is good at their job, but seeing it happen in real time was impressive to say the least. A couple weeks after the Article 32 ended we received the report from the officiate. My favorite line was, which was written by a female officiate in a sexual assault case, “This case, borderline, meets the low legal standard for probable cause, but likely would not if there was the ability to cross examine the victim and witnesses”. It was explained to me the only thing necessary for a sexual assault allegation to meet probable cause is a reputable accuser. That is it. If the court believes the girl that made an accusation is of sound mind and body, and the accusation sounds possible, they have probable cause to bring charges to court martial. For my case, they said it met the low legal standard, barely, but would not if my attorney had been able to cross examine the victim or witnesses during the article 32. AKA a good attorney would have easily been able to rip her story apart if given the opportunity to question her about her absurd claims.  Later on in the report, she literally expressed (in big legal terms) that she didn’t believe the victims accusations, that multiple aspects of her story were contradictory, and most importantly, she directly benefited from the accusation which caste significant doubt on the validity of her statements. Furthermore, JAG and investigators never even proved that they had jurisdiction to investigate the claim or prosecute me. How’s that for some shit. A year of hell and nobody even checked to see if they were in their legal right to do anything. Some real high IQ’s in the legal office. After the report was published, it went up the chain. Nearly two months later I got a phone call from my attorney letting me know all charges were being dropped. No explanation on why they were, but it is not difficult to figure out. After more than a year of hell, I get a nice fancy letter signed by a general and get told to move on with my life. 

Unfortunately, in the time since then I know it is not over for me. I find that my fear and anxiety over being helpless and discriminated against has slowly turned to pure anger of the injustice of it all. She has suffered zero consequences, and more than likely won’t. The common line I’m getting from people who were informed of the situation is, “just move on.” But I can’t.  I used to lie awake at night in fear of going to prison for something I didn't do.  Having everything I've worked for my entire life gone at the word of a bitch trying to save herself.  Now, I lie awake at night knowing she got everything she wanted.  She and I still wear the same uniform.  She gets to walk around knowing she won. 

I’m considering filing a defamation of character or libel civil suit against my accuser. Her actions cost me a great deal of money, damaged my career, and to say my mental health and personal relationships have suffered is an understatement. On top of all that, the military has no way of expunging charges. For the rest of my life, when an employer runs my background check, they will see a sexual assault arrest and charge on my record. That is never going to go away.  Part of me is disappointed this didn’t go to court martial, and so was my attorney. We had so much evidence of my innocence, which is rare in sexual assault accusations, that she was looking forward to calling her out on all her lies on the witness stand. The charges may have been dropped, but since they were dropped without prejudice, the door remains open. It wasn’t an admittance that I am innocent, it was an admittance that they knew they weren’t going to get a conviction with the bullshit case they had presented. Proving she lied in court would have made me feel exonerated, instead, I just feel angry.  

If anyone has any legal resources, or a civil attorney I can have a consult with I ‘d appreciate any suggestions. My accuser and I are both military, and we are now in different states then when this all began. I don’t’ even know what state I’m supposed to file the law suit in. The state the accusation was made, the state I reside, or the state she resides? I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag just yet, but I will say I can prove she lied, and actually committed a felony while doing so. She made sworn statements in court, in front of a judge, which were complete fabrications, and I can prove it. We had all this prepared for the court martial to confront her in person. I’m hoping this leverage will aid the resolution of a civil suit, because if the military found out they would prosecute her, she would be discharged and possibly face jail time. I want justice, and you are all more than welcome to come along for the ride.  Again, Thank you all so much. You helped save me, and I am grateful.",MensRights

1627929125.0,"Detained by police for ""Man with child""","Due to unfortunate circumstances, which I won't get into on here,  my grandson (21 months) has been living with me for the last 8 or 9 months.  He's my #1 sidekick and our bond is obvious to all but the densest of minds. 

Saturday afternoon (7/31) he and I went to an outlet mall nearby because I needed some new jeans, and he's in need of some new clothes, himself.  

We stopped after about an hour to have a hot dog and then decided that some ice cream sounded good.  We made our way to an ice cream kiosk/booth - bags in hand - and bought 2 cups of ice cream, then found a bench to sit down. 

Now, to set the scene, my grandson insists on copying everything I do, right down to the way I dress. If I'm wearing boots, he too must wear boots. Same goes with ball cap, t shirt, etc.  

On this day, we were both wearing college apparel from my Alma mater.  Hat and t-shirts were almost identical.  Jeans and converse chucks as well.  He was my mini-me. 

As we're eating our ice cream and he's pointing at different objects, people, etc., I hear someone say ""Sir, do you have any ID?""  I turn to look and its a male and female officer.  No ""how we doing?"" or anything.  Just ID.

Long story short,  someone had called them because its suspicious for a 49 year old man to have such a young toddler with him, and I was suspected of possibly abducting him.  

Nevermind him screaming as soon as they picked him up and began turning him where he couldn't see me. Forget that we were eating ice cream together, dressed alike and he kept pointing and saying ""Pop. NO!"" while they put me in in cuffs for my own protection.  (I guess I shouldn't have been questioning them.)

I complied with every request. I explained at least 10 times, who I was and why I had him - the whole history leading from his birth til now,  to what ended up being 6 different officers; all the while listening to my boy cry hysterically. 

In the end, a sergeant decided that I was okay, and let us leave, but I'm afraid this scare is going to stick with the boy for awhile.   It was a nightmare, trying to drop him at daycare this morning.  

I never had to deal with this with my two (no grown) children.  How does one go about getting some kind of official ID that matches a child to a specific adult?  I don't want to experience this again, just because I'm a man. 

Anyone else had to deal with this?",MensRights

**TwoXChromosomes**

Most recent post about Amber Heard was a year ago--well past the time when we knew her story wasn't holding up--about her reading a letter about abuse allegations at the Incredible Women (barf) Gala. There are previous posts made three years ago about her initial allegations against Depp.

Zero talk about how she was the abuser. Every post with exculpatory evidence for Depp is deleted either by automod or manually by moderators. They are sweeping it all under the rug because it does not suit their narrative. 

**Feminism**

Last post about her domestic abuse case was three years ago. Highlight post:

>The Internet’s Reaction to Amber Heard’s Domestic Violence Case is Proof of Why More Victims Don’t Come Forward

Just like TwoX, they are deleting everything about her abusive nature.

**MensLib** (yes, this is a women's community)

Last post was a couple of months ago, which is even more shameless than TwoX and Feminism: the moderator team asks the users there to give Amber Heard the benefit of the doubt. They pussyfoot around the fact that we have her, on tape, discussing at length exactly how she committed horrific abuse against Johnny Depp. The users jump on to claim there is no ""perfect victim"" of domestic violence. 

**GenderCritical**

Bizarrely, the most honest of the bunch. A post three days ago agrees that Amber Heard abused Depp, but then immediately jumps into apologetics with ""bUt WoMeN ArE KiLLed bY mEn eVeRY dAy.""

>But fucking hell what a hypocrisy is it to keep talking about Amber and Johnny while domestic violence is a problem that affects and KILLS women EVERY DAY, all around the world. Majority of victims are WOMEN. Majority of physical abusers are MALE.

If you CAPITALIZE random words, it MAKES your argument more CONVINCING.

**Why is this related to men's rights?**

Women are not held accountable, and they are held accountable by other women the least. The largest feminist communities on reddit, and therefore the largest feminist communities on the Internet outside of Twitter, are either (1) censoring posts about Heard's violence or (2) justifying them. 

Hold women accountable.

Edit: as this post goes on, more and more people are getting confused. Nobody is saying that women's communities need to talk about every case of women abusing men. The case of Amber Heard abusing Johnny Depp, however, is one where they allowed posters to talk about how Depp abused her, but are now refusing the actual facts of the case to be posted. This is an active effort to **hide the facts of the case once they became too inconvenient.**",MensRights

We encourage you to share your opinions, experiences, and voices to help contribute to our goal in helping alleviate issues that modern men face. 

&#x200B;

Belonging to this sub does not mean that we hate women or don't care about the discrimination that you face; most of that hate that comes from this sub is geared towards the blatant media biases and hypocrisies. Similar to the BLM movement this sub is a place for ALL of us to focus on men's issues and progressive ways to help make life better for our fellow brothers, fathers, and sons everywhere. We encourage all who wish to help to participate!

&#x200B;

It is important that our ideas, posts, and methods are questioned, discussed, challenged, and even sometimes ridiculed; this is all part of a healthy dialogue and will move our cause forward.

&#x200B;

It would be a disservice to ourselves and our focus to be dismissive of any voices that hold genuine opinions and ideas. We understand that Reddit is a male dominated space, and this sub more so, But I would like to extend a personal invitation to any and all women who want to be heard in this sub to do so, and I challenge all the men in this sub to listen and hear what our female comrades have to say. Its not easy to walk into the lions den and feel safe, so we have a responsibility to foster an environment where discourse is valued.

&#x200B;

We've seen enough hate from enough hateful subs, and it starts with being dismissive. So we at r/mensrights just want to let you women know that your opinions and experiences are valid, welcomed, and appreciated here.

I think feminists may have bitten off more than they can chew here.   Society has no problem endlessly abusing men, but now that feminists are trying to abuse little boys things may get sticky.   Most people aren't aware that schools have already been changed to privilege girls (See CH Sommers' ""War Against Boys""); if they were aware of this we would undoubtedly see more pissed off mothers and fathers.   This time they're doing it right out in the open.   These disgusting harpies and their billionaire/state backers actually have the gall to tell boys they are abusive privileged oppressors even as they're being drugged with Ritalin and systematically disadvantaged in the education system.   These boys are just learning how to ride a bike for Fuck's sake~!   

Feminist indoctrination is not so terrible in highschool because the kids can just do a google search and easily debunk eg the wage gap.  But the Australian government is trying to teach this shit to boys (and girls) as young as **six*.**   Ironically these lessons were supposedly designed to reduce male on female domestic violence (apparently the reverse doesn't count), even though the Duluth model has long since been discredited.   So their brilliant plan is to engage in the mass mental abuse of boys at the age when they are most vulnerable and when boys are *already* disadvantaged in schools.   Could you imagine a male teacher bullying six year old girls like this?   How pathetic does a person have to be to bully children?   

Edit: Since the particulars of the program itself are not mentioned in this article here is another one: 

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-37640353

>A guide for the Year 7 and 8 curriculum states: ""Being born a male, you have advantages - such as being overly represented in the public sphere - and this will be true whether you personally approve or think you are entitled to this privilege.""  [Also over-represented in privileged spheres like workplace accidents and deaths -- about 95% if memory serves]

>It describes privilege as ""automatic, unearned benefits bestowed upon dominant groups"" based on ""gender, sexuality, race or socio-economic class"" [interesting that socio-economic class is placed last on the privilege hierarchy, even though it is by far the most important indicator of actual ""privilege"" -- to the extent that we can even quantify such nebulous concepts; I wonder if that's because most feminists are middle and upper class?].   

>Year 11 and 12 students are introduced to the concept of ""hegemonic masculinity"" which ""requires boys and men to be heterosexual, tough, athletic and emotionless, and encourages the control and dominance of men over women"".  [Excuse me, *requires* men to be heterosexual?   Have these idiots not watched a wild life video?  Are feminists suggesting that we pray the hetero away via feminism like religious fundamentalists demand that gays ""pray the gay away?""   How in the fuck is this shit being taught in schools?  Nevermind creationism: feminism is the new ""Jesus rode a Dinosaur""]

>Pay inequality, anger management, sexual orientation and the dangers of pornography [porn is actually strongly correlated with a decrease in violence, sexual or otherwise, against women] will be among the topics explored by students in the programme, costing A$21.8m (£13.5m; $16.5m).   [Gee that money was well spent.   I think it would have been better spent on programs for Australian Aboriginal peoples.   They have the highest rates of domestic violence in Australia -- not due to ""toxic masculinity"" -- but dispossession, poverty and despair.  I think I just blew an intersectional feminist's mind.]

Edit two: Some people have pointed out that this is nothing new (though this takes it to the next level -- I would have assumed that Canadians, Brits or Swedes would have beaten you Aussie cunts to the feminist punch).   As most boys who went to school during the 90's and after can attest, degrading and humiliating little boys is par for the course in modern ""education"" systems.   

In this article (published in the Guardian no less), the novelist Dorris Lessing (herself a feminist!) condemns a ""female culture that revels in humiliating the other sex.""   

>""I was in a class of nine- and 10-year-olds, girls and boys, and this young woman was telling these kids that the reason for wars was the innately violent nature of men.

>""You could see the little girls, fat with complacency and conceit while the little boys sat there crumpled, apologising for their existence, thinking this was going to be the pattern of their lives.""

>Lessing said the teacher tried to ""catch my eye, thinking I would approve of this rubbish"".

>She added: ""This kind of thing is happening in schools all over the place and no one says a thing.

>""It has become a kind of religion that you can't criticise because then you become a traitor to the great cause, which I am not.

>""It is time we began to ask who are these women who continually rubbish men. The most stupid, ill-educated and nasty woman can rubbish the nicest, kindest and most intelligent man and no one protests.

>**""Men seem to be so cowed that they can't fight back, and it is time they did.""**

As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**

Over then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys.

Cornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *“commensurately graded by their teachers”* in any subject *“as their test scores would predict.”*

The answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.

Boys are falling significantly behind in grades, *“despite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.”*

After fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *“a teacher’s subjective assessment of the student’s performance”*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *“socio-emotional skills.”*This has had a significant impact on boys’ later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child’s future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.

Eliminating the factor of *“non-cognitive skills…almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades”*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *“surprising”* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.

The report also found that:

* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.
* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.

**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys. It has als been shown:**

In another study in the work place researchers asked supervisors to grade two poorly written essays and to provide feedback directly to each writer over chat, so that the writer could improve. At this point, the writers' names (Andrew or Sarah) were revealed, revealing that one was a man, the other a woman. Participants submitted a grade to each writer, as well as substantive comments to improve their essays.

Participants were more likely to tell white lies to the woman writer,  **inflating Sarah's grades nearly a full letter grade higher than from their initial private evaluation.

What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up nearly as much too.**Current system is bad for everyone but it just s happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading, mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter) all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting girls but doing nothing for boys

Telegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)

I do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety – and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex

By the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender’s triumph – never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn’t dare.

Along with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century.

What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up  nearly as much too.** Current system is bad for everyone but it just s  happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes  about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading,  mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter)  all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of  uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing  anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it  would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships  and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single  degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for  example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting  girls but doing nothing for boys

Telegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)

I do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the  1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to  raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at  least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades  of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in  class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral  dubiety – and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class  treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for  those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never  seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex

By the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist  commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the  rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that  females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook  boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education  system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender’s triumph – never  acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at  the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in  the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn’t dare.

Along with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this  feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has  characterised their outlook for the last half century.

1578482443.0,"I've Been Falsely Accused of Sexual Assault , My Life Has Become A Living Hell and Nobody Cares","Recently, I was falsely accused of sexual assault.

I am a member of the US Military and the girl who filed the sexual assault accusation was in the fast lane to getting in A LOT of trouble.  What she had done was against more than a few rules and would have resulted in her getting kicked out of the military.  When I was first informed I was horrified, upset, and angry.  After speaking with counselors and a defense attorney I came to terms with it.  If law enforcement did their jobs they'll figure out pretty quickly she's lying to deflect from her own behavior and I can move on with my life.  Unfortunately, this couldn't be further from the truth.  

For those unfamiliar with military justice system, when a member is accused of wrong doing that particular branches law enforcement agency investigates.  Their job is not to prove or disprove the accusation, just collect the facts.  The results of investigation are handed to the JAG office, and from there it is decided if they want to pursue charges.  In the civilian world this is the equivalent of someone reporting a crime to the police, and the police investigating.  Unless there is overwhelming evidence a civilian is not usually immediately charged with the crime.  While law enforcement conducts the investigation the accused goes on with their daily life.  Not so in the military.

I was placed on an administrative hold.  What does this mean?  It means my career is at an absolute standstill until the investigation is completed.  I was supposed to promote six months ago, but still haven't.  Having to explain to friends and family why I wasn't promoted was a real treat.  The admin hold also means no TDY's, no formal training schools, nothing to help or advance my career or my job proficiency.   This ordeal has cost me no less than 15k in pay.  To say that my mental state is an absolute fucking disaster is an  understatement.  Crippling depression, weight loss / weight gain, PTSD, anxiety and a whole host of other issues.  My girlfriend is a therapist and she gave me a list of her professional observations of what I've gone through and what will be needed in the future to help me get over this.  It's going to take a long time.  

I have been put through hell over this.  The ""investigation"" has been going on for more than 8 months.  My life has been on hold for 8 months and NOBODY GIVES A SHIT.  Here are the following things I have heard:

The female will suffer ZERO repercussions for lying.  NONE!  I can literally prove she stated multiple lies in her initial statement.  As of right now they PCS'd her to a new duty station of her choice ""to protect her"".  We weren't even at the same fucking base and have different career fields!  There was zero chance of us ever interacting.  Before this accusation she was on the fast track to discharge.  Now, nobody cares what she did before.  Only that some evil man raped her and she needs to be protected.  Now that she's under a different chain of command they have decided she has a ""clean slate"" and all her previous issues are gone.  Her new command is not going to pursue charges against her, even though her former command requested they do so.  She got exactly what she wanted.  She was even promoted ... ya know ... the same thing I've been denied.  hy accuser has actually committed multiple crimes under the UCMJ which I could file charges against her for.  I've been told they wont pursue charges because anything I claim, regardless of how truthful it is or how much evidence I can show, will be seen as a retaliation and not taken seriously.  

Nobody is going to be held accountable for how I've been treated, the damage to my mental state, career, or financial well being.  I've already lost 15k in pay, and that number gets higher with every passing day.  I have suffered greatly and I haven't even been charged with a crime.  The best I can do is go after her in civil court for defamation of character, which would more than likely loose me money even if I won the case.  My attorney even stated I'd be paying thousands of dollars just to make a point on principle.  I have been told by multiple high ranking parties that when this is over that I am just supposed to BE GRATEFUL that its done with and move on with my life.  Apparently, people can lie and fuck up your life and I'm just supposed to smile and be thankful I'm not being sent to prison over a crime I didn't commit.  

I held off for 6 months before finally admitting I had massive mental health concerns and started counseling.   I have been having suicidal thoughts and am smart enough to know I need to nip that shit in the bud now.  My Commander told me that JAG  and Law enforcement see this as me trying to garner sympathy, or that I have a guilty conscience.  They literally told my commander this when they spoke!  The US Military has a suicide epidemic right now and when a member seeks out help it seen negatively.  Unbelievable.  

Several friends have been interviewed by law enforcement.  They are required to sign NDA's before leaving so they couldn't specifically discuss anything with me.  However, two of those members contacted my defense attorney to request to testify in my defense if this goes to court martial.  Not just because they know the truth, but more so because of how disgusted with law enforcement they were.  As stated, specifics couldn't be discussed, but they told my attorney that law enforcement was incredibly biased against me to a remarkable degree.  One friend even said the interviewer said my name ""with disgust in her voice"".  The questions they were asked were not open ended, or the kind you would ask if you wanted someones side of the story/perspective.  They were all leading and an obvious attempt to say anything to incriminate me.  One even said when they attempted to tell what they knew about the situation, which was in my defense, investigators tried to cut her off and accused her of lying for me.   It was not collecting facts in the least.  My First Sergeant told me investigators got angry with him because he advised me of my rights and not to speak to them without my attorney present.  They actually cursed him out when they interviewed him simply because he told me what my rights were.  For context of how bad this must have been, one of the girls requesting to testify on my behalf is an ex, and before this she hated my guts.  I know she still dislikes me, but even she couldn't sit idly by while my life is torn to shreds.  I don't deserve that.

I'm sorry for the rant, but I can't talk to anyone about this.  Anything I say to anyone can be used against me, regardless of what I say or the context.  Any time I reach out for help I'm told it looks bad.  More than anything I'm angry about the injustice of it all.  I haven't even been charged with a crime and I feel crippled.  I'm scared to death.  I just want this nightmare over.  What's sad is they've won.  When this is all over, I'll be so happy I can go back to my life that I won't care that this whole ordeal has been biased and left me with crippling anxiety and PTSD.  Its crushed my soul and I haven't felt any kind of happiness in months.  It's destroyed my career, friendship, and relationships.  I have no faith whatsoever in the US Military anymore after this, but can't leave or I'd forgo all retirement benefits.

&#x200B;

EDIT: kinda long title but basicly this is what my friend said, not me. im norwegain so luckily i dont have to deal with this shit and our country has a gender equal draft thing. STILL my country being really good on the equal gender stuff (apart from the millions of double standards) i still see news and people commenting ""women and children"" as if they are worth more than the average male life. Why not just write ""civilians and children"" or something like that. i see some people calling them out but unfortunatly theres still a good amount of ppl who are like this

EDIT 2: It's funny how alot of people now are like ""woman birth 1 kid, man give seed to 100"" As if Ukraine is living in some tiny Tribal cult where the population is highly unstable, we have more than enough people in the world any argument that is ""but man can impregnate alot of women while woman only birth 1 kid"" is stupid in this current day. I see not EVERYWHERE but ENOUGH for me to notice it that people on news etc are saying ""WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND MOTHERS"" .... what about men and fathers? why not just say civilians or something instead of seeming like women are the only ones affected...lol? its pointlessly sexism .

EDIT 3: Where is feminism? most feminists i've talked to insist it's about EQUALITY FOR MEN TOO!! ... yet i haven't heard a peep other than the ""my heart goes out to the vulnurable women, mothers, elderly and children"" Checkmate feminists, you aren't for equality after all :O im so shocked......

EDIT 4: sorry for bad english. Oh and this got pinned... glad theres alot of attention to this problem right now as it's an EXTREMELY sexist one.

1552375623.0,Lost my job because I was targeted for being a white male,"I'm a 33 year old white male, and I am a mental health counsellor. I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. 

She took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be ""fixed"" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. 

Flash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I ""don't fit in"" and that my ""views are better suited elsewhere."" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.

I have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.

Edit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.

The list:
-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said ""I didn't see the point"" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; ""there are too many of you and only one of me"" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)
-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me ""you can't say that!!"" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings. But of course that doesn't go both ways)",MensRights

The secretary told me in the past that if I get there when the kids are getting out then to just wait until they're gone, then bring the packages in.

No problem right? Except the whole time I'm waiting in my truck, there's mothers walking by with their children giving me dirty looks. It made me feel bad, and I hadn't even done anything wrong. Even as I'm going into the school with a package, some random mother intentionally shut the door in my face. Like, what the fuck?

Another time, I was out for a walk when some random boy came up to me and said ""Hi!"". And me, not being an asshole, replied ""Hey dude!"". Then the mother gave me the dirtiest fucking look ever, just simply for being polite!

1373670650.0,"I ask 2 girls to leave private property, I end up hand cuffed in the back of a police car.","Right now I am so fucking pissed off I can barely post this post. I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. 

Tonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. 

After a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text/posting like crazy. 

After about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. 

So for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered ""creepy"" by doing my job. 

The officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course. 

Update #1: I woke up this morning and my just venting on here blew up. I've replied to a few comments. I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me ""that is utter bullshit"" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!

Update #2: I recieved a phone call from the police departments internal affairs division today, they took a statement from me and are going to look into how the officers handled the call. I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car. 
  

Update #3, It has been over a month since I filed my complaint over be handcuffed, detained, questioned, and background checked. So this afternoon was low at work and I called the CPD internal affairs division to find out the status of my complaint against the officers. Well over 45 minutes being put on, on and off hold, I was told that there is no record of the report. I have the report number and they can't seem to find it. I guess this is my answer, it never happened. ",MensRights

I lost custody of my child, my family was torn apart, my mental and psychological health was destroyed. For the last 11 months of jail I was isolated in administrative segregation in a cell by myself where I left once a week for recreation. 

The detective that arrested me admitted at my trial that he never did an investigation, he arrested me 30 days after questioning me. I was denied bond 11 times and I developed major health concerns. 

As to the girl who did this? Yeah, we hooked up, but, I didn’t know she was married. When her husband found out, she didn’t want to admit she was a whore so she said I “raped her”. My DNA was never found, there was NO evidence even supporting something occurred, there were no “reproductive injuries” no physical injuries, not even a bruise. 

At trial, I was found not guilty of one of my charges, the others were a hung jury. My attorney asked the judge to dismiss the rest of the charges because the statements based on her accusation were “inherently incredible and so manifestly false reasonable men ought not to believe it”… the judge agreed 10000% and dismissed my charges, I was released 12 hours later.

If you experienced what I just did, what would you do? How would you do it? Who would you get in contact with?

Last Saturday at around 1:30 PM, because of the long weekend, Disney Springs in Walt Disney World in Florida was very busy.  And as it often happens in crowded places there was a line for the ladies room and almost none to the men's room. 

The particular restroom was located at the World of Disney store.  The men's room was busy, all the urinals were occupied but two toilet stalls were open.  I went into a stall and was doing my business.  I heard the door open and someone announced: ""woman coming in"".  I have seen this happen before when a female custodian comes in to the men's room to clean.

This woman walks directly to an open stall.  She announces ""I am not waiting in that line.""  Followed by ""Y'all don't have anything I haven't seen before"".  

After she finishes her business, she walks over to the sink again announcing ""Y'all don't have anything I haven't seen before"", washes her hands and then walks out.  All the men in there kinda looked at each other like ""what just happened here""?

This woman not only disrespected every man that was in the men's room at that time, she also disrespected every woman waiting in line.  Worst of all, she got away with it. 

Imagine if a man did exactly what she did by going into a busy ladies room.",MensRights

1600912864.0,"After 2 years, I finally won my custody case after being accused of molesting my daughter","There's a long backstory and if you're super interested, you can look at my post history (I constantly change minor details for anonymity).

Short recap: I've had primary custody of my son and daughter since 2015. Divorce was amicable at first but their mom met a guy on Tinder and went off the deep end. She began accusing me of domestic abuse and calling the cops on me all in an effort to take full custody and move 400 miles away to be with her Tinder guy. It resulted in a settlement out of court giving me primary custody and her secondary custody with her paying very little to no child support.

In the intervening years she failed to utilize a large chunk of custody and ultimately the Tinder guy died under mysterious circumstances. Almost as soon as he died she began showing interest in the kids and we started to communicate and get along. Not a full month after Tinder guy died she was already shacking up with a new guy that supposedly had lots of money. He seemed like a decent guy if not a little immature. Anyways, she told the kids she was moving back locally and everything was groovy up until she got pregnant with his kid and decided she wanted custody of the kids.

We all met for lunch and she sprung the information she was pregnant and wasn't planning to move back to our home state and that she wanted primary custody of my son only. When I had a chance to get the kids in the car and speak to both my ex and her boyfriend in private I said in the most polite way possible that they can get fucked. This resulted in Rich Boy threatening me with his family's deep pockets. Once I got home with the kids I texted my ex wife to let her know I appreciated us getting along for a few months and would like to see it continue that way and that going to court would not end well for her and ultimately be a waste of money for the both of us. I got served court papers a month later stating I molested my daughter and that mom wanted primary custody and child support.

Flash forward until today after almost 2 years of me being in constant anxiety and fear we had our final hearing. My ex attended via Zoom and was already turning on the water works. We had the hearing and the judge ruled in my favor 100%. He saw through her bullshit and didn't have time for it. He awarded me every single penny I spent on litigation (almost 10 grand) and child support of 900/mo.

Honestly I feel disoriented, I'm stunned. Best part is, she quit her job 2 weeks ago thinking if she wasn't working they wouldn't order her to pay child support. Judge wasn't having any of that bullshit either. First payment is due 10/1 and she has to turn over court fees in 90 days.

This is a blatant violation of equal rights, it's like a two-tiered justice system.","So, the Mayor's office has just announced a [new program](https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/pilot-launched-to-tackle-reoffending-rates) where female offenders will be spared prison. It is called the The program is called *The Female Offender Diversion Project pilot.* [Here's another article](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/hundreds-of-female-criminals-including-thieves-and-drug-users-will-be-spared-jail-under-a-pilot-scheme-to-tackle-reoffending/ar-AAHorN1) on it.

It's worth noting that the London Deputy of policing and crime, Sophie Linden, is former Hackney MP who tried passing a [1000 pound fine](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gkne3/criminalising-the-homeless-is-a-new-low-for-london-733) for being homeless.

In my opinion, this is very troubling and disingenuous. This is a blatant discrimination and indefensible inequality. It is creating a separate justice system for men and women where a man is automatically treated worse simply for being male. It is direct inequality under law- this is creating a two-tiered justice system where a male and female offender are automatically treated differently simply for their gender. The arguments given are very illogical and really don't hold up:

>Research found women more likely to reoffend than men after a short sentence

So why is this a justification for *more*lenient treatment? This makes absolutely no sense as a reason,. If anything, if males were more likely to re-offend, it would be said that they deserve *harsher* punishment because of it.

And couldn't it be likely  that female offenders offend more *because* they receive more lenient treatment *to begin with*. This has been the [standard legal practice](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/06/26/justice-secretary-dont-send-women-prison-unless-commit-violent/) in the UK for over a year...so wouldn't it make sense that the group that knows they face less consequences would be more likely to re-offend? [This article](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45512468) is an example of that, a woman repeated arrested for shoplifting saying she does it over and over again because the consequences are so minor.

I did some research, and found [this powerpoint from the Ministry of Justice](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759772/women-cjs-2017-statistics-infographic.pdf). It disputes the argument that women are more likely to offend...on the bottom right, you'll see the rates for reoffending is *higher* for males (31%) than females (23%)

So that that argument is based on statistics that aren't even true. Either way, still a poor argument IMO.

>The move to help 1,000 female criminals over the next two years has been launched by London Mayor Sadiq Khan after research found women are more likely than men to be sent to prison for a first-time offence.

This is extremely unlikely to be true, given the above...in fact, it's logically impossible...it's actually the law to exempt women from prison for minor offenses, and has been for a year...there is absolutely no way female offenders are more likely to be sent to prison for a first offense than male offenders. I would like to see that data publicly. Even so, it's not a justification for a separate and distinct legal system.

>Shoplifters, drug users, thieves and low-level offenders will instead be referred to specialist services for help with mental health problems and substance abuse.

But if the issue is to address factors like mental health and substance abuse, why make it a gendered program? Why not make it a program that focuses on mental health and drug offenses? The argument that women are ""more likely"" to be affected by those things doesn't hold water, because under this program, a woman who *isnt* affected by one of these factors still benefits from the program, while a man who *is* affected wouldn't, simply for his gender. There's no sense in making it a law that treats gender as an absolute. In fact, doesn't so is blatantly discriminatory. To grant 50% of the population automatic immunity from prison for theft is absurd.

>A lack of a women’s prison in London means women are taken further away from their families and support networks, which makes the process of rehabilitation more difficult and women entering custody are at high risk of losing their accommodation and having significantly worse employment outcomes than men

This argument is absurd...the problem then would be the lack of women's prisons in London. This feels setup, for the past few years there have been [calls to close women's prisons](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/01/why-we-should-close-womens-prisons-and-treat-their-crimes-more-fairly). Now this has happened, it's being presented as a reason why women need to be treated *even more* leniently.

So now, a woman with no mental health issues or drug issues who steals will be automatically spared prison, whereas a homeless man who is starving who shoplifts will be sent to prison.  50% of the population of London now knows they can commit theft with impunity from prison. This seems like a very dangerous circumstance.",MensRights

I had a divorce trial this summer. I have 4 kids, and my daughter has been living with me for the last two years, due to the abuse of her mother. I was petitioning for custody of my 3 sons. Currently, I get every other weekend, and 1 day a week. In the summer, I got them overnight for that day. 

I had not received the order from the judge yet, but my ex did. Not only did I not receive full custody, or joint custody, but the court decided that my son's and I didn't need that overnight in the summer anymore. 

After she geelfully told me that had changed, I started thinking about my and many other fathers situation.

 I am a slave.

 I am forced to pay my ex wife, and the courts use the love I have for my children to keep me paying. I can't leave, because my kids need their Dad. I also cant leave because the state will do their best to get me back here. I cannot stop paying, because that is illegal. If I quit my job, the state just runs my social security number to see if tax documents have been filed, and they start their immediate money grab.

I am forced into financial bondage, due to not wanting to be married to a woman any longer.

 I am good enough of a father to pay for my kids, but not good enough of one to raise them.

1591790783.0,"Scotland's new gender quota law directly discriminates against men. It requires at least 50% women, but not 50% men. Men have no protection.","Scotland has recently updated their 2018 [**Gender Representation On Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018**.](https://www.gov.scot/publications/gender-representation-public-boards-scotland-act-2018-statutory-guidance/pages/1/). This act is  gender quota for women on public boards. When you read the actual measures and provisions, it's completely one sided and allows for discrimination against men. Men have no protection under this measure.

Essentially, the measure requires all public boards to have at least 50% women. [Having *more* then 50% women is also encouraged, however.](https://www.gov.scot/publications/gender-representation-public-boards-scotland-act-2018-statutory-guidance/pages/2/). And here is [a screenshot of the above](https://imgur.com/a/EqbTYiZ)

>2.3 The gender representation objective is not a cap. The Act does not require board non-executive membership to be precisely 50:50 men and women and it does not prevent a board having more than 50% of non-executive members who are women. **A board with more than 50% of non-executive members who are women has met the objective.**

Added emphasis mine- this makes it clear that having more women than men, by any amount, is considered a success.

The measure requires a woman to be chosen over an equally qualified man if it brings the percentage of women closer to 50%. However, as was made clear above, this does not apply for men when they are under 50%. So even if men are only 40% of a board, it's still permissible to hire a woman over an equally qualified man.

[Here's the section on the application process](https://www.gov.scot/publications/gender-representation-public-boards-scotland-act-2018-statutory-guidance/pages/3/)

[>However, in circumstances where there are two or more equally qualified candidates, at least one of whom is a woman, then section 4(2) of the Act requires the appointing person to give preference to a woman if doing so will result in the board achieving (or making progress towards achieving) the gender representation objective. This is, however, subject to section 4(4).](https://imgur.com/a/utrmptX)

[>If there are at least 2 equally qualified candidates, one of whom is a woman, then the appointing person must appoint the woman if doing so would result in the board achieving (or making progress to achieving) the gender representation objective. This is subject to the provision at section 4(4) of the Act **which requires the appointing person to consider whether the appointment of an equally qualified candidate who is not a woman would be justified on the basis of a ""characteristic or situation"" particular to that candidate and allows appointment of that candidate**.](https://imgur.com/a/KnO049M)

Added emphasis mine- it means that even if a man *is* equally qualified, he must specifically be able to prove why it is appropriate or necessary to add him. So in practice, it means a woman will almost always be considered more qualified than a man (as always works with these things.) So it'll be easy for boards to become 70-80% women, and men have absolutely zero legal protection.

So let's just take a look at [what this will actually look like](https://www.gov.scot/publications/gender-representation-public-boards-scotland-act-2018-statutory-guidance/pages/7/). I think this paragraph sums it up well:

[>If, at the time of recruitment, the gender representation objective has been achieved, the requirements at section 3 and 4 of the Act will not apply unless the appointment will result in the lapsing of the gender representation objective. For example, if a board has 6 female board members and 3 male members and is recruiting to replace one of the female board members there would be no obligation to appoint a woman in a tie break situation (i.e. where there are at least 2 equally qualified candidates, one of whom is a woman). However, if at the time of the appointment round the board has equal numbers of female and male non-executive members and the board is recruiting to replace one of the female members, then section 3 and 4 would apply with a view to achieving the gender representation objective after the replacement had been appointed.](https://imgur.com/a/RreTEQh)

So, if there are 6 women and 3 men, that's not a violation, it's just that ""oh, well, a man is allowed to be hired now."" But if it's 5 men and 4 woman, a woman *must* be hired over a man.

My guess is this law will stay on the books indefinitely. Feminists will say now ""oh, it's just temporary to achieve equality"", but come the time when most boards are vast majority female and men are significantly underrepresented, if anyone tries to point out how the law is very outdated and unfair, feminists will say ""you're just trying to undo progress by women!""",MensRights

When Trump wins in 2024 the media is going to seemingly make a 180. All of a sudden they're going to appear to care about our problems.

**From November 2024 and onward the Democratic Party is going to pretend to care about us but they'll try to not do anything significant because it will piss off feminists, and feminists are a core liberal voting bloc.**

**Do not give Democrats your vote unless they’re actually pushing for tangible reform.**

The main thing I want is the financial abortion. I refuse to vote for “Pro-Choice” politicians until it’s a mainstream part of their agenda. I go so far as to vote Republican in every election even though I know MRAs will never really be a part of The Right. 

Whatever your thing is, you need to make sure your vote and support is contingent on actual progress. 

The Left is going to pay a bunch of lip service to our pain but try as hard as possible to still appease feminists by not actually doing anything substantial.

1354935992.0,On the shadow-banning of Paul Elam and Dean Esmay,"Dear feminists, and by feminists, I mean most of you sorry cretins who inhabit r/mensrights.


Good afternoon, my name is John, some of you may be familiar with my work. This letter is hopefully clear up a few misperceptions and put to rest the concerns of many members pf this community.


Several days ago, my colleague and friend Paul was shadow banned, not by the moderators of /r/mr, but by the administration of reddit. Similarly, Dean Esmay, with whom I work at AVFM was also shadow banned. Apparently, this was due to their endorsement or public statement of support for discovering the identities and publishing the names of feminist participants and organizers of the U of T Warren Farrell protest.


I have also been told by some members of this community that stooping to the tactics of the enemy is unacceptable. Addressing this claim literally, I agree. I completely agree that censorship, intimidation, threats of death, advocating violence, initiating violence, and cultivating hate against a group based on identity or sex, s totally unacceptable. However, the criticism directed towards me used that rhetoric, but referred to my advocation of publication of identity the woman harassing a man at Warren Farrell's protest. The “you are fucking scum” woman. 


And apparently, my genuine intention to attach her public behavior to her name is seen as “stooping to the tactics of feminists”


Are you fucking kidding me?


Why do any of you dolts imagine Paul, Dean, myself and other actual MRAs advocate public exposure of the evangelists of hatred and the initiators of proxy violence? Do you think, in your pea brains we intend harm to come to the cretins we document?  A summary pass through any of our collected writing  will quickly disabuse you of that stupid assumption.


In fact the concern over the practice of outing the agents of hatred and the initiators of proxy violence is not a moral concern at all. It's fear of offending the powerful. On Reddit, that would be the feminist hegemony who seem able to indulge in any cruelty and hate with impunity – on the misguided notion that if only we in the r/mr reddit were a bit nicer, they'd come right around and embrace the undeniable reality of our concerns.


Stupid and cowardly. Thats what this concern is. 


And just in case any of you slow-witted dolts haven't got it yet, while I wont do it on reddit – respecting the rules of the house here, outside of this forum, I will publish the name of anyone – male or female, MRA or Feminist who advocates violence or initiates violence, including by proxy, and I'll do it with satisfied smile on my face, and not even a slight twinge of guilt. 


Or do you snivelers think accountability is only for men, and that women, or feminists (including feminist men) have a free licence to commit and cultivate violence and hate?




Do you think women are so fucking helpless and infantile they cannot possibly own any accountability – even in the commission of direct violence? If you /do/ think this, then you are indistinguishable from a gender ideologue, and you will have earned my unlimited contempt. How can you possibly oppose violence without supporting accountability for it's direct and proxy initiation? 


Oh, and if anybody, after reading this cares to claim that publicly identifying the initiators of violence is /actually/ a backhanded technique for putting them in harms way, then you're too stupid to be allowed to participate in an adult conversation. Yes, you too David.


Anti-feminism is the revolutionary notion that women are (like men) moral agents.


I expect I'll be getting banned on reddit directly after posting this, which will simply be the wider reddit community making itself even less relevant on the topic of the Men's Rights Movement. 


And to the Reddit Admins: Go on, ban me, and tell yourselves the violence cultivated and committed by the feminist community is harmless because it principally targets men.

1401007317.0,Elliot Rodger and blood libel.,"Many of us may be wondering why there are stories circulating which claim that we are somehow linked to the terrible events around the recent shootings by Elliot Rodger, claims which have been [thoroughly debunked by Forbes among others.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/05/24/the-disturbing-internet-footprint-of-santa-barbara-shooter-elliot-rodger/).

If we look at history we find that virtually every group that has been singled out for hate and persecution has being subjected to this technique.

In Europe before world war two, the claim that jews abducted and murdered children was circulated, called blood libel.

In america, claims that black, men had a preference for raping white women were popularized.

The aim of these claims is simple: it's an attempt to make the public believe that the target group are not like them, that they are *bad by nature*. If they are bad by nature then the public can then be told to ignore everything they say without consideration. And that's what this is about: the hate group tries to stop the public considering the target groups words because they fear that the public will find merit in them, so they attempt to deny them that consideration.

I'm sure this thread will attract responses which pretend to be shocked that I've dared to compare what's happening with the plight of Jewish or black people. But as a group *we're literally being accused of being linked to a mass murder and of being complicit in it*. And in the same way, some will feign outrage at seeing me compare us to the civil rights movement, but that's what we are all about: a group who are discriminated against in the court, the university and the street, fighting for equal rights and being accused and abused in return. There is no hyperbole here.

I encourage you to stay positive through this. The hate groups targeting us are doing it because they're so terrified of what we say that they're resorting to telling everyone we're murderers to try to silence us. How powerful must our words be if that's what it takes to smother them?",MensRights

1328902812.0,I am a man who was falsely accused and tried for rape. AMA.,"Let me start by giving you a little bit of history to the relationship I was in at the time. I started dating this girl in my senior year of University. Things hit off quickly. We spent almost every night together, and fell in love. After graduating, we both landed great jobs in the same town, and moved in together. I honestly can't describe how great things were. We had no debt, good savings, great jobs, and the relationship couldn't have been better. I knew she was the girl I wanted to marry less than a year after we started dating. My parents, who were divorced, were very outspoken about not rushing into marriage, which is why I hadn't yet proposed 3 years in.

This girl was my perfect match. We knew each other inside out, and would never get sick of one another. I would have done anything for this girl. We had tons of fun, lots of friends, and lots of money. Life was good.

If there is one area I wouldn't have described as perfect, it was our sex life. Don't get me wrong, we had great sex, but finishing was often disappointing for at least one of us. This was the problem (gets a little descriptive):

Whenever I would ""finish"" first, she would become upset and slightly frustrated. Most of us probably know the feeling of getting really close and not being able to get there, so I never really blamed her for that. Usually when this happened, she would become very self-pittying for about an hour, and we'd go to sleep on opposite sides of the bed. It's like she was deliberately trying to make me feel bad for not making sure she was taken care of. It's probably worth mentioning I'd usually offer to go down and finish her off, but that rarely had any effect. Anyways, this wouls usually last about an hour, she would calm down, and everything was always fine. 

Now, here's the flip side of the coin. Most nights I was actually able to make her come. After this happened, I'd continue, and I would say about 30% of the time, she would be in pain. i don't know how normal this is or why it happened, but I accepted it. In these instances, I'd have to stop. The difference is that, although I was usually extremely frustrated (and horny), I'd let her know that it was OK. She was usually frustrated with herself when this happened more than anything else, so I tried as best as I could to constrain my frustration and show her that she meant more to me than anything else. We'd cuddle and go to bed. 

This may not sound like a healthy sex life, I don't know, but to me it was a very minor detail in an otherwise amazing relationship. We still had lots of excellent sex, and we were both very happy with the way things were going.

So now to the night it happened. We had just gotten back from a 5 day trip to her parents' place, which meant no sex for those 5 days. When we got back, I was ready to fuck anything that moved (I was 24, and probably at my sexual peak). I had been letting her know since the night before just exactly what I was going to do to her when we got home.

So we got home, things started, and then something happened. She came first, and then started to have that very recognizable painful look on her face. Now in the past I was able to restrain my frustration in these circumstances, but this time I couldn't. I rolled off and over to my side of the bed. She could tell I was frustrated and wanted to talk about it. I obliged, and began to pour out how exactly I felt. The conversation was actually fairly well-spirited, but I was still frustrated. After a little bit, she asked me if I wanted to try and go at it again. Once more, I obliged. A few minutes in and the same thing happened, except this time, she put on clothes, stormed out of the room, and left.

I was completely shocked. I tried calling but got no answer. It was no more than 30 minutes later of constantly trying to reach her that the cops showed up. She'd told them I'd raped her.

I immediately went in to shock. It was the first time in 3 years I felt the girl of my dreams start to slip away. It seemed surreal. I felt helpless. I tried to reason with the cops (it seemed like my only option at the time), but that obviously had no effect. They took me in for questioning. I was later released on bail and moved in with my parents, but of course, with a trial pending.

For the next few months, everything just seemed like it was in a constant downhill spin. A local feminist group got hold of my girlfriend's story and came to her ""support"", although it seemed their main goal was to make my life a living hell. They found out where I worked, and it didn't take them long to make sure I was fired. At every court appearance, sure enough they were there to ridicule and taunt me for what I'd done, even though I maintained my innocence.

I considered suicide a few times. Ever since graduating, I had the perfect life planned. Get married, have kids, live the life.  I couldn't even imagine my life without her in it, or finding someone to replace her. I had no job, and even started to believe some of the things these people were telling me. I was a wreck. I was very fortunate to have a supportive family. They believed me and helped me through it, and that kept me alive.

As for the trial, I told my side of things, and her story was constantly changing, always getting closer and closer to my account, which never changed. Eventually, her story had changed so much that the judge no longer considered the event to be rape. I was acquitted, and life moved on. The feminist group was not pleased. They were convinced I was guilty and that my ex had somehow been ""emotionally manipulated into changing her story"", because apparantly she still had feelings for me. This is beside the fact that she hadn't talked to me since that fateful night. They continued to pester me and be a generally nuissance, but slowly faded away.

So now, 4 years later, I am again in a happy and trusting relationship. The best thing for me has been to realize how silly those feelings of ""I will never find someone to replace her"" were. I actually managed to find a new decent job during the trial, so yes I'm employed. I look back though, and still have no idea how I could have been so wrong or what the hell happened. She still won't talk to me (although admittedly I stopped trying long ago), and I haven't the slightest idea how things went from best to worst. To think I was going to marry this girl...

So there you have it. If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.",MensRights

RAPE in AMERICA: Decade by Decade

In the 50’s and 60’s, rape was rare, and what little there was was kept hushed up, swept under the rug, and never spoken about in polite company.

In the 70’s, there was a marked increase in both the frequency and the brutality of rape, coinciding with the start of the women’s movement. Although it may not have been a coincidence, but rather the natural reaction of men unhappy with women demanding more and more rights, and wanting to “put them back in their place”. In this pre-DNA era, a rapist’s best chance of getting away with his horrible crime was to do away with the only witness/evidence in such a way that her body would not be located for an extended period of time. Countless attractive young women lost their lives to serial rapist/killers during this decade.

In the 80’s, the feminist movement doubled-down, working hard to stretch the definition of rape to include acquaintance rape, date rape, and even spousal rape. They not only insisted that these assaults be prosecuted just as vigorously and punished just as harshly as the most violent stranger-rapes, but they began demanding a lower standard of proof: A woman’s word alone, with no collaborating evidence at all, should be enough to send any man to prison forever, while new “rape shield laws” prevented him from confronting his accuser by delving into her past or questioning any contributing factors on her part that may have led the man to believe that “she wanted it.”

By the 1990’s, the new science of DNA had burst on to the scene, promising an end to the widespread scourge of unpunished rapes. But a funny thing happened on the way to ending injustice: The double-edged sword of DNA began proving—conclusively—something that most people had never even suspected: Women had been lying about rape. Frequently. And for the most trivial of reasons. Or for no reason what-so-ever. Or for reasons that were shockingly cruel and evil. And thousands of innocent me, who had been paying the price rotting in prison for crimes they didn’t commit, were now on the road to being exonerated.

By the turn of the century, actual rapists had a brand new, and rock solid defense. DNA had taken the “who-dun-it” out of rape cases, so now, every defendant’s plea became “it was consensual.” And every prosecutor’s trump cards, “women never lie about rape” or “why on Earth would she lie”? has been so thoroughly destroyed by the revelations of DNA that they dare not even utter those words in court, lest the defense bring up 1,000 counter-examples. A jury, playing by the rules, must acquit. Every time.

Now, nearly half-way through the 2010 decade, rape is more popular than ever. It’s becoming the great American pastime. Potential rapists are springing up like mushrooms, contemplating rape and prosecution, and saying “I like my odds!” while feminists are pulling their hair out (and with equal fervor, NOT pulling their hair out), making increasingly insane demands to weaken the Constitutional Rights of defendants, which even if enacted, would just result in more innocent men being punished and then exonerated, which in turn would create an even greater backlash from the jury pool.

The moral of all of this is, of course, that DNA science could have—and would have—solved the rape problem, had women been living up to their pre-supposed virtue of truthfulness. DNA + women not lying about rape = a death blow to rapists (and even the eventual elimination of the rape gene from the gene pool). Instead, feminists sought UNequal justice for women while trying to keep the power of the nuclear option of being able to falsely accuse men of rape when necessary.

So now, and in decades to come, we will surely see the day when the feminist-created, made-up statistics of “1 in 4” and “every 6 minutes” will become a reality. A reality that could have been different, had feminism truly embraced the concept of EQUAL rights, and justice for ALL.

Happy Thanksgiving. And pass me the turkey. But stick a fork in the concept of prosecuting men for Acquaintance Rape. It’s DONE.

[TL;DR 11th grade student examines the evolution rape culture from 1950's to the present and beyond, placing most of the blame on feminism and predicting rape will become more commonplace, and prosecuting rape will become pointless. I, the teacher, am having trouble deciding what grade to give. Note that I don't have to agree with the paper's conclusion to give it a good grade, but only that some compelling points were made. And in this case, the points made were unique, and not shared by any of the other papers turned in, nor, as far as I can tell, lifted from any posted internet opinions.]

A JUDGE has refused to immediately jail a young man for having sex with a 13-year-old girl saying today’s youth do not realise underage sex is a serious crime.

District Court Judge Rosemary Davey says Sasha Pierre Huerta, 21, was not a predator and his teenage victim “was looking for” a sexual encounter.

In transcripts viewed by The Advertiser, Judge Davey says teens living in our “overtly sexualised” world are ignorant of the maximum seven-year jail term for underage sex.

“Regrettably — and I don’t live in an ivory tower — that kind of criminal conduct is happening day in, day out,” she says.

“In fact, if you ask most 17-year-olds or 16-year-olds whether they know (underage sex) was an offence carrying seven years’ imprisonment, they would die with their leg in the air.

“It’s just crazy, in my view, that we maintain this law and we do not pass the message on out into the community.”

Huerta, 21, of Walkerville, pleaded guilty to one count of having sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 14 years.

He admitted that, in February this year, he had sex with the girl, 13, following an all-ages party in the city.

Huerta had met the girl earlier that month at Marble Bar, sparking sexually-explicit Facebook interactions during which she claimed she was 14 years old.

Do you think our children fully understand that underage sex is a serious crime?

In the transcript viewed by The Advertiser, the court was told the girl dressed “like a 23-year-old” and “presented herself as a woman”, attending bars and events she could not lawfully enter.

“This is a girl who was not a girl who was sitting at home just putting Barbie dolls away,” Judge Davey said.

“This is a girl who was out there wanting to party and mix with older people, who put herself out there.”

The transcript records the fact a school class was sitting in the court’s public gallery as sentencing submissions were heard.

Lawyers for Huerta said their client and the girl agreed to have sex — even though she could not lawfully consent, and he was aware of her youth — in his bed at his home.

Judge Davey said she doubted the school class in the gallery understood their burgeoning sexuality could lead to criminal charges.

“I’m not suggesting that it’s not a serious matter for a man, although he is a young man too, to have sexual intercourse with a person underage,” she said.

“I would like to do a straw poll of the young people sitting in court at the moment — I’m not going to — to find out how many of them realise it’s a serious crime to even have touching of the genital area under the age of 17.

“It’s just that I find it extraordinary that there’s never public discussion about (the fact) we have a whole generation of young people having sex ... which is a crime.”

In sentencing, Judge Davey told Huerta it was “a crazy mixed up world we live in”.

“The reason why the law is as it is, is to protect young people from themselves,” she said.

“Whilst the media and the world we live in might encourage young people to think they are in control of their bodies and their sexuality from a very young age, you know ... that with sexual development one does not necessarily have the maturity to make decisions about sexual intercourse at an early age.”

Judge Davey said Huerta’s offending was not predatory and that he was “deeply shocked, upset and contrite” about his actions.

She imposed a two-year jail term, suspended on condition of a two-year good behaviour bond.

“One of the reasons why I suspended the period of imprisonment is because I think it is most unlikely we’ll see you back here again,” she said.

“You have your whole life ahead of you. Be good.”

1323488682.0,This subreddit is turning into a politically correct wuss-fest.,"Maybe it is because we're getting comments from folks who are new to the scene. Perhaps the cold winter winds are causing everyone's nutsacks to shrivel up. But in the last several weeks, I have seen this subreddit take a distinct turn towards PC feminist-appeasing manginaville, and I don't like it one bit.

In case you guys haven't noticed, we are a tiny group of people fighting an incredibly powerful and well-funded hate movement. This hate movement has connections in all levels of government, and has purposefully turned society against men. We are also dealing with a society full of kool-aid drinkers (men and women) who will throw their brother/father/son under the bus if they think it will help some woman, somewhere. 

I have been talking about MRA-related stuff for 17 years now. And no matter how ""nice"" i used to be, no matter how logical i tried to make my arguments, and no matter how far i went out of my way to prove my egalitarian mindset, I was always painted as the evil woman abuser simply because I wasn't a dedicated kool-aide drinker.

Eventually I realized that as a MAN, I will be called into question NO MATTER WHAT I SAY OR DO. And as an MRA, I will be hated no matter what I say or do. Therefore, I simply think there is no reason for us to be nice and accommodating to people who want us dead.

Stop making excuses for bigots and misandrists.

Stop shouting about NAWALT, when scant few women lift one fucking finger to help men.

Stop thinking we can feed Feminists ice cream cones of logic and sweetness, and they'll somehow have a revelation. They won't.

Stop questioning and criticizing every single fucking thing REAL activists at AVFM are doing. If you don't like their approach, put up your own damn advocacy site and prove to us how your way is better.

No. You bought into the hype:

1. Fighting sexism against women and ignoring sexism against men is not fighting for equality,

2. ""Women need more rights so there is equality"" is just playing victim, not seeking equality.


**""I have a right to post here!""**

Yes, but ask yourself why you are really in a subreddit that tries to discuss the issues of men's rights when it is not really allowed in feminist subreddits. Question your own motives. Are you really here for discussion or just to scream at us that we are wrong?

The patriarchy is not a catch-all for all your gripes about the world. It is not the dark side of the force. It is not satan. It is a convenient excuse for feminists to avoid responsibility.

1353007466.0,Help!  They're removing all male-oriented fitness equipment from the gym in my building!,"
I went to the gym this morning and saw this:

http://i.imgur.com/nVcRP.jpg

The gym in my building has been overly biased towards women for a while now. [1]

There tons of aerobic nautilus equipment.  There are three treadmills and four stair climbers.  All the machines are the mechanical (non-free weight).  And the only alternative if they remove the bench press is a smith machine (which have been shown to cause injuries and be less effective than the bench press).

    http://thewaronbullshit.com/2009/09/21/dangerous_exercise_machines/

The dumbells max out at 30 lbs.  There is no squat rack and originally there was NO bench press but another male in the building offered to donate one.

Further, there have been issues with the bench press before.  The incline press causes the bench to shift dangerously.  I've brought this up to the HOA only to be ignored.

I've been trying to work with our HOA for a while now and offered to by a squat rack but was ignored by the HOA for 4 months before giving up.

NOW they want to remove the LAST piece of gym equipment usable for men.  

I think part of this is that the HOA is getting bad advice but they don't seem to want to listen to any external advice other than those on the HOA board and their exercise machine vendors.

There was a gentleman at the gym who I brought this up with and he 100% agreed with me on all these issues.

I'm 90% certain they are just going to ignore me when I bring this to the attention of the HOA.  Men are 50% of the building and should receive 50% of the resources.  

1. I have NO PROBLEM sharing the gym with women.  If the situation were reversed I would fight for it to be fair for them too.

1627366071.0,"About the patriarchy, and how it causes men's rights issues (by a feminist)","Hi everyone as the title says I'm a feminist looking to have a friendly debate/discussion. I'm not here to scream ""Y'ALL ARE WRONG MEN SHOULD DIE"" so I hope y'all don't do the same at me lol! (Seriously though, rude comments will be ignored). Fair warning that English is not my first language. I am also not well versed in US politics or issues since I am from southeast Asia. This is going to be a long post so TLDR at the bottom!

So I've been looking through this subreddit out of curiosity, and *I think my biggest issue is that y'all deny that men's rights issues do not stem from patriarchy (and I want to argue against that).* 
I'm looking for (constructive) input and different perspectives!

**Let's establish what's patriarchy first** . The wikipedia definition is very straightforward: [Patriarchy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy) is a social system in which men hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. (Some people have said that Wikipedia isn't a reliable source but I wanted to be unbiased and Wikipedia has the most agreed upon definition).

**Contrary to popular belief, the concept of patriarchy does NOT mean that ALL men are the oppressors who hold power, or that ALL women are oppressed**. Let's break this down: The expectation of men to have primary power does not mean that they are privileged, infact it means the opposite. [Expectations of power means certain expectations of other traits, such as leadership, aggresiveness, stoicness and material ownerships. Associating maleness with all these things deprives women of their own autonomy in these areas. Meanwhile, femaleness is associated with submission to that primary power, which entails expectations like reproduction, emotion/expression and family. Women hold power over men in these aspects, depriving men of their autonomy too](https://open.maricopa.edu/culturepsychology/chapter/stereotypes-and-gender-roles/). 

So do men actually hold primary power? NO they are **expected** to. Remember that the patriarchy is describing a social system, not a ""hard truth"". So are men responsible for patriarchy? NO! Is everyone responsible for upholding patriarchal values? YES! 

**So why do most feminists ignore this fact and seem to advocate for women alone?** Statistically, [men are known to be more violent than woman](https://nypost.com/2019/01/16/the-scientific-reasons-why-men-are-more-violent-than-women/), which makes people focus on women's issues, as they are perceived as more oppressed. Men's issues are neglected because [they don't occur at the same frequency](https://globalnews.ca/news/1221021/women-more-likely-to-be-victims-of-violent-crimes-study/) or have the same marketability, as violent crimes against women (which also makes a much more sensationalist headline). [This isn't to say women can't be violent too](https://www.domestic-violence-law.com/blog/2016/april/women-or-men-who-usually-instigates-domestic-vio/), it simply means that people perceive men to be more violent due to largely reported numbers. 

So looking at the concept of patriarchy from a female-centric view (by focussing on women's issues alone) throws men who are oppressed by that same patriarchy, under the bus. This isn't a contest and we should not focus on who is more oppressed. **Ultimately, both women and men experience certain priviliges and oppresions due to patriarchy.**
 
Now there's been ALOT of bashing against the concept of patriarchy in this subreddit because it's a huge part of feminist theory. I completely understand that many people on here do not agree with feminism because if their experiences with feminists, and that's totally valid. However, it should be worth noting that feminist theory should not be judged so quickly based on a bunch of people on the internet trending the hashtag #menaretrash. I can assure y'all that the people who say this are either not well versed in feminist theory or displacing their aggresion that's stemming from trauma (I'm not justifying their actions here, simply offering an explanation, their actions are wrong). I call myself ""feminist"" because I agree with the [concepts behind the theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_theory), not because I advocate for women alone and i
I try not too look at these concepts from a female-centric perspective (Hence, this post to understand your perspectives).

The concept of patriarchy isn't just a part of feminist theory though, and as many people seem to assume, it's not a concept that's been ""made up"" by feminists and only supported by anectodal evidence. It is a [sociological concept](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system) first and foremost, meaning that it is a theory that sums up patterns of social interactions that has been observed within society and studied by many! And yes, theories change overtime, especially sociological theories because society changes over time. 

**So what does patriarchy have to do with men's rights?**  Everything! As I pointed out before, [the patriarchy reinforces gender roles (maleness is associated with leadership, aggresion, stoicness, material ownership, etc while femaleness is associated with submission, reproduction, family, emotion, expression, etc)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1984-23015-001). Historically speaking, gender roles stem from our biological differences, but in the age where we have technology to make up for our short comings, whether man or woman, we are equally capable, rendering gender roles as a biproduct of social systems rather than a necessity. 

**Let me give a few examples of men's issues that has commonly been discussed in this subreddit and how the patriarchy is behind them**:

• men not receiving child custody: [the patriarchal society views women (femininity) as more suited towards caring for young, making people lean towards granting women child custody as opposed to a man.](https://secularpatriarchy.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/the-rationale-of-father-custody-under-coverture/) This usually means they grant it to the women (regardless of how fit she is to actually take care of the child) and assume that the man will neglect or abuse the child, or will be an incompetent parent, which is unjustified.

• men getting abused/assaulted: [the patriarchal society views men as dominant, and thus, violent/aggresive/strong and capable of protecting themselves.](http://www.hiddenhurt.co.uk/male_victims_of_domestic_violence.html) They are also perceived to be unaffected by trauma because being emotional is seen as a feminine trait. So people struggle to grasp that men can be abused/assaulted and suffer trauma from such an incident in the first place. Furthermore, men are perceived to more likely BE in the role of an abuser. This also factors in on my next point.

• false rape/assault allegations: The fact that this issue isn't getting discussed more is baffling. False rape allegations are basically people who are taking advantage of the assumption that men are more likely to be in the role of rapist/assaulter because the patriarchy deems men as ""dominant"", which is synonymous with violent/aggresive. There's also the case of a self-fulfilling prophecy, in which [rapists are morely likely to be men](https://medium.com/@annetteinafrica/all-men-are-potential-rapists-399176050f3) (regardless of whether the victim is a women or a man) due to patriarchal expectations of dominance and violence. While [statistically, men are more likely to be in this role as opposed to the numbers of false rape allegations recorded](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-men-are-more-likely-to-be-raped-than-be-falsely-accused-of-rape), it is still a gross injustice that should be addressed.

• suicide rates among men: the patriarchal society expects men to be ""strong"" and dominant, and the assumption is made that external events would not affect them (and even if they did, men are expected to hide them and be expressionless). This makes men themselves repress emotions, stunting emotional growth and making them prone to mental illness. It also [makes their mental issues undiagnosed (ignored or ridiculed), making them less likely to even seek help in the first place](https://www.verywellmind.com/men-and-suicide-2328492).

• men's body image: another issue that's should be discussed but society decides to gloss over. We see plus size models of women in magazines all the time (and this is a great thing!) but never of men (not so great). The assumption that men should be strong comes with the [expectations for men to be physically fit, and not just in a way that seems you healthy but in an extreme way to fit the mold of beauty](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/lets-have-a-frank-talk-about-male-body-image-kpkn/) (this perception is based on the assumption that the man has to please the submissive women with his dominance). As you can see, this leads to body image issues, insecurity, eating disorders and more mental illnesses. 

• men are expected to provide for the family and earn more than the women: [Men find themselves falling into the role of ""leader"" because of the centuries long expectation of being the breadwinner, regardless of whether he likes it or is capable of it.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1759-5436.12064) It is expected by everyone around him, that he provides for the family. But if he earns less than, or even equal to his wife, he is seen as incapable of ""supporting the family"", eventhough both men and women have the opportunities to earn for the family (it has to be pointed out here that in most countries, women are not priviliged enough to work, which actually reinforces the role of a man as primary provider. All in all, it's not a fun situation for both of them). 

As I pointed out in my last point, notice how certain priviliges enjoyed by man is stemming from the oppresion of women. Notice how the women enjoys priviliges stemming from a man's oppresion. These things are interconnected, and that's what the patriarchy tries to describe. This is what systemic sexism is. It should be noted that oppresion isn't the fault of a priviliged person, but the fault of the societal system (patriarchy), which stems from the values upheld by ALL of society. **So instead of playing the blame game, why not focus on dismantling it?**

How you ask? Well first, by accepting generalisations for what they are: generalisations. Treating stereotypes like facts is what got us here. Let's allow people to make their own choices instead of placing expectations on them to conform to patriarchal values. This means that it's completely up to the person whether they want to conform to a gender stereotype (such as a man wanting to work in risky careers or a women wanting to be a housewife). The difference is that they CHOOSE this and aren't pressured into it. It also gives people the freedom to choose otherwise (such as a man wanting to be a househusband or a woman wanting to follow risky career paths). Equality isn't about equal distribution of roles among different genders (ie. Same number of men in STEM fields as women) but about equal opportunities (both men and women having the capability to choose their career path without any hindrances).

Anyway, this is all I can think off the top of my head so far. Please feel free to mention any men's issue I missed so I can explain further! **Btw, I'm not asking anyone to ""change into a feminist""**. Whether you choose to advocate for women's rights or men's rights is entirely based on your surroundings and experiences, and only our common goal to achieve equality matters. If we can sort out our differences (civilly) and agree on this common goal, then we can focus on the means of reaching it together.

Thank you for taking your time to read until here :)

**TL, DR: the patriarchy isn't what you think it is and it's the source of both female and male right's issues in *most of society (see my 2nd edit)*. So we should stop with associating labels (feminist/men's rights activist) with generalized characteristics. Let's just strive towards equality.**


Edit: I've added sources for people asking for ""proof of the patriarchy"". Again, I want to reiterate that this is a theory/concept that has been studied under sociological and psychological fields so I encourage y'all to search it up and learn more. I admit that feminists often look at these concepts from a female-centric perspective, but the scientific research behind it is unbiased (because that's literally a requirement for scientific studies). I also realise now that labels (like ""feminist"") can be powerful and that the modern feminist movement hasn't brought favourable benefits for everyone. However, [I can't deny the benefits that it has brought to others all over the world](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-007-9272-7), and want to continue identifying as a feminist so that I can stand behind the concepts of feminism to advocate for both men's and women's issues.

To the the people who provided constructive criticism, unbiased discussion and different perspectives, thank you. Y'all were awesome and I learned a lot :)

Edit 2: it's come under my attention that some people may be part of social networks that have already dismantled patriarchy, but has some other form of power hierarchy (like the matriarchy). While this is an issue that's less widespread compared to patriarchal social networks, I realize that describing ALL of society as a patriarchy is detrimental to dealing with issues that people in a matriarchy face. So my conclusion: **We need to dismantle all forms of power hierarchies (patriarchal or matriarchal) to truly be equal**. To the people who say that power hierarchies are ""not bad"", consider the possibility that you enjoy more priviliges from that system than others do.",MensRights

1347661725.0,If sexual harassment is such a problem for women why do they dress in more revealing clothing than men?,"I got into an argument recently here on reddit with a user named felltir (perhaps this person was a troll...judging by the name, it's not an outlandish theory) but it got me to thinking about something...Feminists often claim sexual harassment is such a problem for women, and when I say harassment I am not talking about assault or rape (so those statistics which supposedly prove that assault and rape are not correlated with what women wear are a response to a straw man argument which I am not making)...In any case, feminists indeed make this claim and many women do as well.  So we have that.

Now, if you look at any woman in the subway or passing you in the street you will find that women **relative to men** wear clothing which is far more revealing than men do.  Most men wear collared shirts, a pair of gray pants or loose fitting blue jeans and shoes or boots, perhaps a jacket or an overcoat...something simple and anonymous...Women in contrast wear clothing that men would feel utterly ashamed to wear, like booty shorts and skin tight t-shirts with high sleeves (designed to show off even more skin) and women spend far more time concerned with their appearance.  Aside from rock & roll musicians, women seem to be the only ones who wear things like skin tight leather pants and short skirts...Men simply do not do this.

Now, if we put this together we have a situation where something doesn't add up.  If women were truly sexually harassed to a point where this were a major problem for them (relative to men), the market would dictate that we would find the situation to be completely the opposite...Women would be dressing in far more conservative clothing (relative to men), to ward off this truly problematic harassment.

But here we have the complete reverse taking place...We have women claiming sexual harassment is such a major problem and yet we also have women choosing of their own accord to wear far more revealing clothing.

The same is true of feminists who claim women are overly ""objectified"" and that this is problematic for women.  If it truly were problematic for women, why do they select clothing which objectifies their own bodies?

Now...before anyone straw mans me and says I'm saying women should cover up, I challenge you to point to a section of my text where I said that.  I did not say that.  My statement is simply that if sexual harassment were such a problem, relative to men, we would see women more covered up, relative to men.

The only explanation for this is that the benefits of women objectifying themselves and of women revealing skin and wearing skin tight clothing (narcissism, control over men, personal exaltation) outweighs the potential costs (harassment, such as whistling or comments)...

And anyone who thinks harassment has no correlation with how women dress is a completely deluded moron who I will not have any discussion with.  If you are so far out there that you think how a woman dresses doesn't effect her odds of being harassed you are an idiot.  

Now, I truly do believe sexual harassment is a problem for women, but perhaps it's because they are dressing in such a way as to provoke the response.

Enter sex positive feminist and their ""slut walks"", the complaint that it's not a woman's fault that she wears revealing clothing and is harassed, it's the harasser.  See, here we have an instance of feminists throwing gasoline on the flames they themselves are claiming to want to put out.

But isn't this a cryptic straw man?  It's not like preventing women from wearing overly sexual clothing and asking them to take responsibility for their actions is something which society doesn't expect of men.  If I wore booty shorts and went on the subway and I was harassed, it would be obviously because I am wearing such revealing clothing.  If you think about it, these types of slut walks are not an issue of equality...Are they fighting to be able to do something men can do and they can't?  No.  Men don't walk around in booty shorts, free of harassment.

But this is, for the most part, a free market, and it's a reflection of our values. So, if it is true that more women are being harassed than men and it is true that more women specifically choose to appear this way, it follows that whatever cost the sexual harassment has, the benefits outweigh the costs, at least relative to men.

Whatever, these were just some thoughts on my mind.  Anyone else consider this?",MensRights

It was horrible, Feministing now is using tragedies of UNDERAGE girls to promote misandry. Basically two girls start a fight, one of them bullies the other, the bullied one commits suicide, it's gendered bullying stand to Feministing. Which automatically would insinuate that the girl was being bullied by a boy, which wasn't the case, even the article that they quoted clearly explained that she was being bullied by another GIRL. I understand that most of these days *feminists* are just closeted misandrists, but to use the tragedies of underage people of their same gender is awful.

Seems we have posts all the time asking why feminists and MRAs can't get along.  These people don't understand that feminism is directly opposed to equality and men's rights.  But what if that were not true?  What if one day a miracle happened and every single feminist out there suddenly had a Road to Damascus experience and realised they needed to quit hating men, and spreading lies about men, and creating discrimination against men?

It wouldn't change a thing about the movement, and here's why.

As MRAs begin to get their message out, ordinary men are beginning to realise the situation of oppression that they are in.  They might not use that word but they are realising more and more that all this stuff about women being oppressed and men being assholes is all bullshit.  They are realising that it's usually men who get the shaft, not women.  Women get lifted up.  And they realise that society is lying about all this.   

What is their reaction?  They are angry.  They are going to be pissed off.  Probably they will be angry with women in general, which is bad, and misdirected, and something MRAs need to try to carefully reduce.  But certainly they will be angry at feminism, and that anger is actually accurate and the truth and will make them stronger for it.

But it does mean that feminism has to die.  Because if these men realise their situation and then see MRAs making kissy with feminists they will simply disregard the MRAs too.  Feminism's reputation is already too embedded and mixed up with women only and anti-male.  The MRAs are not well known.  If our society even tries to let feminism off the hook for all the evil it has done, men will _CORRECTLY_ see this as society being complacent still about anti-male behaviour.

They will _CORRECTLY_ see it as just one more example of how ""women"" can attack men and never get called to account.

There must be an accounting.  So EVEN IF every feminist suddenly stopped hating men their movement must be destroyed (publicly repudiated and called a hate movement) so that men and young men especially can see this and be satisfied that finally there has been an accounting.  Only then can they accept that society is maybe changing.

And frankly?  If any feminist ever really did change then **they would be the first to say this** and understand that they cannot change their ways and stay within the feminist movement.  **Any time you see a feminist who claims to ""get it"" about men but is still a feminist -- they don't get it**.  They don't get it and they think their crimes and the crimes of their movement are very minor at worst and can be swept under the rug and get back to business as usual.  They are more interested in saving their own skin than in addressing the inequalities they created.

Basically, in a conversation regarding drunk people fucking, and men being de facto ""rapists"", a feminist questioned why any man would be willing to have sex with any woman who said anything other than ""YES YES PLEASE!"", and insinuated that she was shocked that so many men would admit that they're basically rapists.

I'm not linking to it, lest I be accused of inviting in a ""downvote brigade"".

You like chocolate, right?  Of course you do, everyone does.  If someone offered you some chocolate, you would eat it, right?  Would you only eat it if that person were manic and virtually shoving the chocolate in your face as they screamed ""EAT EAT PLEASE!!!""?  What if they opened up the box of chocolate, and only reluctantly offered it to you?  Would you turn it down?  What if you asked for the chocolate, and they just opened the box, and motioned for you to take some, but didn't seem to give a fuck?  Would you refuse that chocolate because they weren't ridiculously enthusiastic about you eating some?  What if you met them at a bar, and the two of you were drinking, but they were REALLY enthusiastic about it all?

Now, imagine your desire for that chocolate is MUCH stronger.  In fact, it's foundational to nearly everything about you...and your gender.  Imagine simply hearing or seeing things somehow *related* to chocolate, can stir up a hunger within you equivalent to the hunger of a starving person who hasn't eaten a real meal in years.  Of course, as you mature, your desire for chocolate gets more subdued and nuanced, but when you're younger, especially when you just start eating chocolate, the desire for chocolate can be pretty extreme, and can undermine your judgment.

Add to that a society which has all sorts of rules, regulations, and social conventions surrounding how chocolate should be eaten and procured.  Most of them make sense to you...don't accept chocolate from a kid, don't steal it from people, don't coerce people into ""giving"" you chocolate against their will.  But some of them are asinine: you shouldn't eat chocolate with socks on, you shouldn't directly ask for chocolate, men shouldn't share chocolate, etc.  More than that, now you have some people called chocolatists who want even stricter rules.  They tell you that you're basically a criminal who should be locked up because you would accept chocolate from someone who offered it to you when you were both drunk.  They insinuate that you're responsible for the other person's actions AND your own, but that they're not responsible for any actions whatsoever.  They claim it has to do with someone being drunk and being incapable of giving consent to chocolate-sharing.  But in the hypothetical situation, you're both drunk...and they're only blaming you.  When you point out that you disagree, they start insisting that, because you say you *would* accept chocolate even if the person wasn't jumping around like an idiot trying to shove it in your face, you're a horrible person, on par with those who steal someone's chocolate when they're passed out...or those who beat people up to take their chocolate, etc.

A long time ago, some religious people passed laws making it illegal for people to buy chocolate.  Most reasonable people now seem to agree that two consenting adults should be able to sell and buy chocolate from one another...but many of the chocolatists do not.  In fact, they equate buying chocolate with kidnapping people, abusing them, and forcing them to sell chocolate for you under threat of death.  They ignore all the people who currently sell chocolate (illegally) without being coerced, etc.  Aside from that, some chocolatists actually try to outlaw DEPICTIONS of chocolate.  They claim it's also on par with forcing people to sell chocolate against their will, etc.  More than that, many chocolatists also fight for crazy laws...laws which throw out the presumption of innocence (the bedrock of our entire legal system) when chocolate-theft is alleged.  

The thing is, in this world, only gender-A has a natural source of chocolate...gender-B must procure it from gender-A.  So when they fight for some of these crazy laws, they actually fight for legislative gender-inequality.   You look into a lot of their literature...and see much of it holds up gender-A as being inherently superior, but also perpetually victimized, and it holds up gender-B as being inherently inferior, but also perpetually victimizing.  It looks sexist to you...so you call it sexism.  But they have an answer to that.  Instead of denying the idea that they're bigoted against gender-B, they point you to a special definition of ""[sexism](https://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/category/gender/sexism/)"" they're written, which claims it's impossible for gender-A to be sexist against gender-B, but not the other way around...that's right, their definition of sexism is, itself, sexist.

So you facepalm and walk away...unsure of how people could be THIS far off base.  The most fucked up thing of all?  Chocolatism has been embraced, at least superficially, by the mainstream.  These people are actually respected by your society...at least superficially (i.e. people pay them lip-service out of fear).",MensRights

I've left many a female I lived with and the best way to go about it is to go stealth. Plan

Last female I left was in 2006- she became psychotic and controlling after about a year- the usual- so I just started looking for another place to live, got the place, put down a deposit, took a day off while she was a work, got a Uhaul and moved everything out while she was gone.

>Incel is an online subculture, in which men blame women for their involuntary celibacy, i.e. their lack of sexual relations with women. Many incels have a history of problems socialising and finding a female partner, and have experienced rejection in the past. In incel online communities, this experience is transmuted into hatred against women. They reject women’s sexual emancipation and label women as shallow, cruel creatures who will choose only the most attractive men if given the choice.

According to this definition, the incel subculture is not violent, just hateful. 

**Do not allow anyone to call you an incel, if you are on the lookout for a female partner. This is inaccurate and insulting, calling you a member of a hate group.** 

I have zero problems with this definition myself. I have zero hatred against women and I do not reject their emancipation, and I do not discriminate against gender. Nonetheless, I do have an issue with several narratives and trends. I, however, support most of them, as I do believe in the freedom of the individual.

1355950522.0,Why Do You Think U.S. Women Are So Miserable Now?,"I work for a company where we deal with hundreds of corporate clients and 98% of the women I talk to (thousands over the last 5 years) are SO passive aggressive and just sound so miserable all the time. And women I see anywhere just walking by look so incredibly pissed off and miserable, just hating life.

And so much of the time when they *do* manage to laugh, it's always that 'cackle' like a witch, like when they're talking on their cell phones - and you know it's about someone they fucked over or someone getting fucked over.

I know a lot of the theories, I just wanted to hear what people here had to say. Of course you'll never get a straight answer from women so it's pointless to even ask them. 

And if you're just going to reply with some braindead answer like, ""not all women are like that"" could you just do us both a favor and not bother and just move on? I'm interested in serious answers. Thanks.",MensRights
1311562304.0,"Throwaway account, long time lurker and closet-convert to the MRM and have some thoughts to share that I've been working on for a long time (anonymously though, GF has a reddit account and I'm not ready to open that bag of worms yet). ","Wrote this essay previously, in a fit of frustration with what I see in the West, so I've copied and pasted. Hope that's ok.

For all the talk about “girl power” and “women kicking ass” which you see on movies these days, if the men of your “tribe” are too weak or demoralised to protect you, you will be enslaved and crushed by the men from other “tribes” before you can say “Vagina Monologues”. Which means that if you break down men’s masculinity, their willingness and ability to defend themselves and their families, you destroy the country. That’s exactly what Western women have done for the last forty years. ….

The male protective instinct doesn’t take action because Scandinavian women have worked tirelessly to eradicate it, together with everything else that smacks of traditional masculinity. Because of this feminism has greatly weakened  Western civilisation as whole. …

Didn’t feminists always claim that the world would be a better place with women in the driver’s seat, because they wouldn’t sacrifice their own children? Well, isn’t that exactly what they are doing now? 

Misandry, the hatred of men, isn’t necessarily less prevalent than misogyny, the hatred of women. The difference is that the former is much more socially acceptable.

If all oppression comes from Western men, it becomes logical to try weakening them as much as possible. If you do, a paradise of peace and equality awaits us at the other side of the rainbow. Well congratulations to Western women. You’ve succeeded in harassing and ridiculing your own sons into suppressing many of their masculine instincts. To your surprise, you didn’t enter a feminist Nirvana, but paved the way for an unfolding hell. ….

Feminists claim that the reason why women haven’t been as numerous in politics and science as men is due to male oppression of women. Some of this is true. But it is not the whole story. Being male means having to prove something, to achieve something, in a greater way than it does for women. In addition to this, the responsibility for child rearing will always fall more heavily on women than on men. ….

it was in fact the women who started this whole “single is best” culture that now permeates much of the West. Since women initiate most divorces and a divorce can potentially mean financial ruin for a man, it shouldn’t really be too surprising that many men hesitate to get involved at all. … At the same time, women during the past few decades have made it a lot easier to have a girlfriend without getting married. So women make it riskier to get married and easier to stay unmarried, and then they wonder why men “won’t commit?” Maybe too many women didn’t think all this feminism stuff quite through before jumping on the bandwagon? …..

The elaborate welfare state model in the West is frequently labelled as “the nanny state,” but perhaps it could also be named “the husband state.” Why? Well, in a traditional society, the role of men and husbands is to physically protect and financially provide for their women. In our modern society, part of this task has simply been “outsourced” to the state, which helps explain why women in general give a disproportionate support to high taxation and pro-welfare state parties. The state has simply become a substitute husband, upheld by taxation of their ex-husbands. ….

Radical feminism has bred suspicion and hostility, not cooperation. And what’s more, it has no in any way eradicated the basic sexual attraction between feminine women and masculine men. If people do not find this in their own country, they travel to another country or culture to find it, which in our age of globalisation is easier than ever. A striking number of Western men find their wives in East Asia, Latin America or other nations with a more traditional view of femininity, and a number of women find partners from more conservative countries. …

radical feminism has been one of the most important causes of the current weakness of Western civilisation, both culturally and demographically. Feminists, often with a Marxist world view, have been a crucial component in establishing the suffocating public censorship of Political Correctness in Western nations. They have also severely weakened the Western family structure, and contributed to making the West too soft and self-loathing …

Well, after two generations of Second Wave Feminism, Ms. Willis and Ms. Beauvoir have had their way: The West has skyrocketing divorce rates and plummeting birth rates, leading to a cultural and demographic vacuum. And feminists still aren’t satisfied. ….

Feminists claim that women have been victims of men, that men have oppressed women for centuries and that the sexes are equal. Denying this will result in the smears “misogynist” and “male chauvinist pig”. But equalising the sexes has led to a crippling feminisation of Western society … portraying women as oppressed victims and the equals of males is one example of how the pursuit of equality is being used to destroy our society and undermine – and therefore be in conflict with – Mother nature. ….

Firstly, let's talk about NAFALT.  It's rhetoric.  Of course not all feminists are fire-breathing monsters like Big Red.  But they are all still deluded into thinking feminism is still necessary and has anything to do with humanism.  

There are laws protecting women from unfair treatment in the workplace and proper treatment of women is now ubiquitous corporate policy.  The wage gap now favors women as does the education gap.  Women are snatching up expensive STEM education hand-over-fist (and pissing it down their legs, incidentally.)  And the courts both criminal and family think they are all innocent angels incapable of doing any wrong.  So they won.  They got what they wanted.  They are obsolete. 

 So at this point the only purpose of feminism is about getting more agency and privilege.  And I tell ya, if you think giving one group undeserved privileges doesn't compromise the rights of another group then you deserve what's coming to by way of your precious ""true feminism.""

So think about what you're supporting when you support a ""true"" feminist.

1413063759.0,"I am a feminist, and I support Men's Rights","Alright, you should all know that I am a self-identified feminist. I support the movement to increase the protections of women, *especially* when it comes to reproductive rights (this is an area I feel is extremely important). But as a feminist (along with other feminist activist I know) we have these outstanding issues with the Men's Rights movement's progress.

Let's list them:

1. We feel as though female dominated positions (Nurses, teachers, dental hygienists, airline attendants) occupied by male employees are just as challenging as the opposite. However, we feel as though it might be **more** difficult for men to find the support that women are able to find when conquering these challenges. (Yes, we *do* however believe that this is caused by a macho dominated society. Sorry, but there's no way around that.)

2. We feel as though the protections for male rape victims are woefully behind the protections for female rape victims (not that they are great to begin with). We take issue with the recognition of male by female rape. However, we also believe this has to do with an overwhelming belief of the fallacy that men can't be raped because they are men, and we think that is enabled by a patriarchal society. (Again, *we* as a group of concerned and hopefully rational citizens, cannot deny that a society who failed to recognize the personhood of over half of the population for as long as it did to be anything BUT prejudiced towards a belief of standard male macho behavior.)

3. We feel as though custody agreements are inherently unfair and without overwhelming circumstances, tend to favor the mother over the father.

4. We fully support paternity leave, or a more neutral parental leave, that is equitable and provided to both parents without causing the other parent to lose time with their new child and spouse.

5. We unanimously support men having reproduction protection options, such as birth control designed for men, excluding the vasectomy as that already exists, but as a more permanent solution. We believe men would benefit from more options.

Things we do not support however are as follows:

1. We do not support the draft (for men or women) and will not pursue the requirement of women to to join the military, and instead pursue the avenue for the entire act to be abolished.

2. We do not support paternal financial abortion, we understand that it is completely unfair and wrong for men to have to financially support a child they did not want; however, we **cannot** deny the rights of a child who had no choice in the matter of their parent's sexual act that led to their procreation. A child should not be made to suffer because their mother and father didn't agree on a contingency plan before a one night stand.

3. We do NOT support the disgusting actions that seem to have been led by popular Men's Rights fringe groups to call into question valid rape reports made by women at a University. Rape is a deplorable human act on all counts, and we do not need to make it worse for REAL victims no matter how many fake ones take advantage of the situation. We cannot condone the vilification of all female rape victims due to the actions of a small few. Our reasoning is that if valid claims of rape are being treated as dishonest, how will a more timid population of rape victims have the confidence to come forward?

4. We do NOT support the idea that one victim group is worse off than another. All rights and complaints of victimization or marginalization deserve the same consideration, we do not believe it's a pissing contest to see whose piss can travel furthest.

*Lastly, our greatest belief is that we do not need to sacrifice or downplay the interests of one group to prove the importance of another. We fully believe that if our argument is valid, rational, and worthy, it will stand up on its own.*

For example, most male circumcisions are done in hospitals or sterile environment with clean medical cutting tools, while most female genital mutilations are done out in the open with dirty non-medical cutting tools (like hunting knives or sometimes a piece of glass even).

Also, female genital mutilation usually takes away most sexual pleasure from a woman, while men can still feel a lot of sexual pleasure after a circumcision. Most of the clitoris (or at least a lot of it) is removed from female genital mutilation, while only the foreskin is removed from a male circumcision. The equivalent to removing the whole clitoris in males would be removing the whole glans of the penis, and the equivalent to removing the foreskin in females would be the clitoral hood.

* Obamacare establishes 7 powerful ""offices of women's health""

* These offices advise the USPSTF.

* The USPSTF determines who gets health coverage, and who does not.

Fore the record, here are the seven powerful women's health offices established under Obamacare (with no male equivalent):

1) Establishes the Office of Women’s Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.

2) “There is established within the Office of the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an office to be known as the Office of Women’s Health”.

3) “Establishing within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration an Office of Women’s Health.""

4) “There is established within the Office of the Director, an Office of Women’s Health and Gender Based Research.”

5) “The Secretary shall establish within the Office of the Administration of the Health Resources and Services Administration, an office to be known as the Office on Women’s Health.”

6) Establishes the Office of Women’s Health in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

7) Establishes the Office of Research on Women’s Health (ORWH) within the National Institutes of Health

Like the horrifying Jim Crow legislation of the 60's, President Obama is too much of craven coward to directly discriminate against men, boys, and fathers.  Insted, he has outsourced his discriminatory hate mongering to a series of powerful ""women's health"" bureaucrcies, which are in charge of spilling the blood of  men, boys, and fathers to pay for women's perks and political privilege. 

Recently it has become clear how well the president's discriminatory plan is working, with the following USPSTF determinations:

1) Free birth control for women, but not for men (IOM recommendation only)

2) Free tubal ligation for women, but no vasectory for men

3) Free cancer prevention for girls, but no cancer prevention for boys (Guardasil, etc)

4) Free enhanced STD treatments for women, but not for men

5) Free enhanced smoking cessation intervention for women, but not for men

6) Free breast health for women, but no prostate health for men

7) Free well woman visits for women, but no ""well man"" visits for men

Note:  In the case of STD treatment and smoking cessation, there is some protection for men, but extra protection for women.  In the other 5 cases, men are left completely unprotected.

Then came the first mention of men:

8) Cut costs by outlawing coverage of PSA testing for men.  With  no PSA test, it is impossible for men to have early warning of the onset of prostate cancer.   With no diagnosis, there will be no treatment of prostate cancer, which will save government billions of dollars, to pay for extra perks for women.

Well, they are at it again.  Today, the USPSTF came out with its newest man-hating feminist discriminatory policy:

http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/draftrec2.htm

As always  under Obamacare, women are to be protected, men are to be left to fend for themselves.

This time, it is not too late to act.  The most recent Obamacare ""protect women from violence and let men die"" mandate is still a draft.  You can find out how to respond to this outrageous new discriminatory policy of the Obama administration here:

1622396900.0,"As an MRA, I think we should be more at peace with feminism","I know that this isn't really a popular idea, but I trust this movement's respect for other opinions enough to post this. 

As a start, I should state that I've been an MRA for years as can be seen from my history and I've debated many feminists in those years. In those debates I realized that even though many feminists were as sexist as I expected, most actually wanted equality. They just weren't aware of men's issues.

This made me wonder, so I spent time on r/Feminism. Many posts over there are sexist as well, but you can see that a majority of posts just state their opinions without being hostile to anyone and when I showed the sexist posts to feminists I have met in real life, most of them were visibly disgusted.

It annoys me that they don't realize we want equality, they think we are women-hating bigots. But that is because of misinformation, not because they're sexist themselves. Millions genuinely believe that feminism=equality, so they think a movement that goes against its ideals would be sexist. This brings me to my last point.

How many of you can say that they can openly declare their views without being worried? Not me. I still do declare, but I definitely don't feel safe while doing so. The reputation of the MRA movement is bad, which is one of the biggest reasons we have difficulties pushing for change. If we can't make peace, we can't fix our reputation, and we will have a hard time pushing for legal equality, for example. (do I have to point this part out for rule 1?)

If you think I am wrong, please comment why instead of downvoting. I don't have any bad intentions, and I am open for other ideas. I especially wonder what the rest of the movement thinks about this, so please comment.

- No one I have had a relationship with has ever expected expensive gifts from me.

1354329530.0,Question...what rights do guys lack?,"Girl here. Drunk and waiting for a hot pocket to cook. Still I have a few questions. Not trying to be a jerk, sincerely curious about your guys' perspectives. 

Clearly men have more rights than women, maybe you guys don't think so, I don't know... (Although I think there are obviously double standards, different ones for both men and women. Women are called sluts when they sleep around and people always act like all men are potential rapists, etc.) Anywho, I get the feeling mens rights advocates (talking about in general here, not specifically this subreddit, as I haven't extensively read it) blame their problems on women. I see this as silly. Women aren't actively working against men's rights, they're fucking oppressed as it is! **I think when men's rights are impeded upon, it is due to the same system that gets in the way of women's rights.** For example, courts overwhelmingly favor mothers when determining who kids will live with during custody/divorce cases without regard to how good a father the husband is. I don't think this is fair, but I also don't think it's  the fault of women. The same social system that says women are caring, feminine, and good nuturers also paints men as uncaring, lacking emotionally, and not responsible for they're children's development. Who do you think the judge is going to assign custody of the children to with this model of thinking?! **I think men and women are both oppressed by the same system, what do you guys think? Agree or no?**

Edit: Okay, nobody seemed to respond to my most pertinent question, so I bolded it. Like I said, I think men and women are screwed over by the same system, but in different ways. Men are supposed to be masculine as possible and dominant in order to gain access to power in society. Part of this script involves creating a story about how males are 'invincible', when in reality they are not. That's when you start to see men being ignored as a group in healthcare because they don't ""need"" it. On the other hand, as a society we have this preoccupation with taking care of women because we see them as 'weak' and in need of healthcare. I also tried to make a point earlier about the child custody. Women are viewed as caretakers, men aren't. It's only logical for someone who holds such a belief system to give custody to women (not saying it's fair). Also, someone mentioned higher arrests and whatnot for men. Again, women are viewed as weak and non-threatening. Men are viewed as the violent and powerful ones, as persons who actually are threatening and need to be put in jail. Basically, what I'm trying to point out with the above examples is that I think the disparity in treatment we see between men and women all stems from our current beliefs about the ""natural"" behaviors of men and women. I also think all of that so-called difference is pretty much utter bullshit. Men need healthcare just as much as women, men can be just as good of parents, women should be punished just as equally as their male-counterparts for committing the same crime, and so on. The thing that you guys seem to be missing the point of is that *women aren't doing this to men, men are doing it to themselves*. The president is a male. Congress is mostly male. Police officers are mostly male. Court Judges are mostly male. Most positions of power in our society are overwhelmingly held by men. Why then, are men still being denied their rights? It's because these same men are 'trying' to maintain male dominated power structures that rely on men being treated in such ways. (I don't mean consciously trying, it is just the way things are, and women are also guilty of enforcing the same systems when able to do so.) 

To the person who questions that women actually have less rights then men--you've got to be kidding me. Would you also maintain that racism is a thing of the past? While women are quite equal to men in a legal sense, that is about as equal as it gets. I think I phrased it poorly using the word ""rights,"" but women do not have near as much access to power as men. Men dominate positions of power in our society, and it is **not** because they actually deserve to be there more than women. Women get paid less than men for the doing the same jobs with the exact same qualifications. Somehow, women's work is inherently worth less then men's work. I could provide other examples, but there is no point, I am not trying to prove which sex has it worse in society. Men and women need to work together to fix a social system that has oppressed both in different ways. But really, can't anyone here see the fucking contradiction in men's lack of rights and males occupying positions of power that also cause these lack of rights?! 

Sorry. I am tired and want to go to bed, but I appreciate the replies. I hope I didn't come off as too judgey, but it really worries me when I hear people blaming feminism or women for men's lack of rights. That's bullshit. Feminism will increase rights for both men and women, any other interpretation is simply inaccurate. ",MensRights

The thought of jail was too terrifying for me and I decided I was going to meet up with my girlfriend and string her along just long enough to avoid having her press charges.

Yesterday morning though, the police showed up at my apartment and arrested me. My gf told me she would wait until yesterday to give me enough time to decide before she called the cops, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised she screwed me over.

On my way out, I could see the police were talking to my neighbor. I have very thin walls and I'm terrified about what my neighbor might have heard.

I spent the night in jail, the worst nightmare I could ever imagine and the one thing I wanted to avoid more than anything else. I have a (male, thank god) public defender and my parents posted bail.

My mom isn't speaking with me. My dad says he is very disappointed in me. I could barely hold back my rage at them. I tried explaining how my girlfriend tried to IMPREGNATE herself against my will. How I had taken extreme (though justifiable) measures to stop this injustice, but they're so blinded by fucked up gender equality beliefs that they are turning against me, their own son.

Oh, also when I got home today I found an email from a summer job I really wanted saying I didn't get it. Is it related to this? Did my gf tell them I was arrested? I can't prove it, but I'm suspicious as hell.

I feel fucking destroyed reddit. My entire life is ruined by this lunatic and every single fucking person is against me. I'm hopeless for the first time in my life.

I'll never trust another person I date. I'm flushing every condom, I'm only using spermicidal lube. I'm even considering getting a vasectomy. 

I don't care if you believe me or not, I'm ready to accept I'm worthless garbage to society. To everyone who supported me, thank you, it means a lot. To everyone else, keep laughing and destroying me. Everything is so bleak, I just don't care how much you hate me.

1357421520.0,"Male babies are 50% more susceptible to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. It seems when it comes to infanticide, our society turns female murderers into victims.","If you've been part of the MRM for more than a few months it should come as no surprise that men are the victims of violence and that boys are abused more by their parents than girls. If we look at deaths ruled as homicide we see not only a clear trend of infanticide, but a sex disparity as well:

http://i.imgur.com/nETpy.png

And I suspect that females are overrepresented in these statistics because female deaths are investigated more thoroughly and thus more likely to be ruled a homicide. Although the statistics differ significantly year to year, the trend is pretty clear. About 40% more boys under 1, and ages 1-4 are victims of homicides than girls. It should be obvious that the perpetrators of these homicides are the parents, more specifically mothers, because they are they ones taking care of young children.

Let's look at deaths due to child maltreatment for all ages:

http://i.imgur.com/fi4WD.jpg

Again, the picture is clear. 50% more boys die from maltreatment than girls, and mothers are twice as likely to be the killers than fathers. These are merely the official numbers. Given how our society likes to treat women as victims *even when they kill their own children*, it is likely the real numbers are more skewed.

Now that we have a general picture of infanticide, let's see if we can shed some light on this mysterious Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). [According to studies SIDS affects 40 to 50% more boys than girls](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11343850). Why should this be the case? Male and female children, especially babies, are very similar before puberty. It makes little sense that boys would be affected 50% more by deaths for which autopsies can find no cause. [And yet various ad-hoc explanations have been advanced.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome#Hypotheses) 

In 1998 a book called [The Death of Innocents: A True Story of Murder, Medicine, and High-Stake Science](http://www.amazon.com/The-Death-Innocents-Medicine-High-Stake/dp/0553379771) came out discrediting the sleep apnea theory of SIDS and pointing to child abuse as the real cause. Here's an excerpt from a review by an Amazon reader:

>There is something darkly fascinating about the cognitive dissonance in imagining seemingly ordinary parents killing their children. There's just as much cognitive dissonance in recognizing seemingly brilliant researchers at the world's most reputable institutions completely failing to see the most common sense truth staring them in the face. Yet as this book points out, that's just what happened with SIDS. The SIDS literature is built on a study pivoting around a family with 5 SIDS deaths in a row, one of whom was a 3 year old who the mother said just keeled over in front of her, all of which deaths occurred when only the mother was present. How did the original researchers and the peer-reviewers and then the many researchers who built on this original study over decades miss this extremely suspicious scenerio? It was either a case of childlike naivite or willful coercion of the facts that led them to overlook the very compelling evidence of parental homicide.

What's not said is that our society holds women in such high regard that it either permits them to murder their children lawfully, as in the case of abortion, or is willing to look the other way. When the cause of death cannot be determined, assuming there is even an attempt to do so, the death is labelled as SIDS. On the other hand when the woman is undeniably guilty of murder, we invented a whole class of disorders called postpartum depression to excuse her conduct.

1378855245.0,The rationale behind /r/creepypms : Validation,"Did anyone ever notice how half the PM's in /r/creepypms aren't even creepy? I'm not talking about the cockshots, or guys asking to have sex and stuff like that. Some are just private messages from guys on dating sites, who get upset when the woman doesn't seem to be interested.

Regardless, the question you need to ask is as following: Why would you make a subreddit where you post evidence of guys who seems interested in having sex with you? What's the point to that? The reason for it is actually very simple: Validation.

Women judge other women, based on how they relate to *men*. An older woman is judged based on whether she has children, whether she is married, and if so, to what kind of man. Young women primarily judge each other based on how wealthy their family is, and how much attention they receive from boys. Look at any high school, and you will notice that the girls group together based on how attractive they are.

Girls keep check on each other. If a girl receives attention from a boy, she rises in standing to the other girls. It's not uncommon for friends in high school to send fake text messages to each other, so that they can pretend to other girls that they got attention from a boy. Some girls will actually invite a friend over during online conversation with a boy, just so that the other girl can confirm that the boy is in fact real.

Of course, girls also need validation of their appearance. If you compare pictures of single boys and girls on Facebook, you will notice something strange on the pictures of single girls. The single girls have comments from their friends calling her pretty, generally from other girls, who are also single. This is a kind of favor that girls do to other girls, to make them feel pretty. For girls in relationships this is generally not the case, as the other girls now see it as the responsibility of her boyfriend to make her feel pretty. However, validation from other girls hardly works as well as validation from guys of course.

This brings us back to the ""Creepy PM"". For a single girl, or even a girl in a (lackluster) relationship, harassment from boys raises conflicting feelings. On the one hand, there is a genuine feeling of harassment. On the other hand however, there is an experience of validation. Even a guy who is not desirable to you as a partner is still valid as a measurement of your own attractiveness. If you show any sign of enjoying the attention, you reveal yourself to be on ""their level"", and you will also face accusations of being ""easy"". However, if you *complain* about the attention, you can elevate yourself above it.

So why do we have a subreddit, run by feminists, where young women can complain about the attention they receive from guys on the internet? The answer is obvious: This is a form of self-help therapy! Feminists are women in need of validation, and /r/creepypms is the place where you can complain about the endless hordes of fedora-wearing neckbeards who are beneath you and yet strife to be with you.

Shall I take it a step further? I will. I remember watching a Dutch documentary, where a woman concerned about growing old goes to a group of construction workers, and asks them why they no longer yell things at her when she walks past them. She needed the validation, and yet she no longer receives it.

However, it works the other way as well. To see ANOTHER woman receive validation from men, makes a woman feel unattractive, because she realizes that other women of her age receive more attention from men than she does. There is one exception to this rule, which is when a woman can tell that the man realizes that the other woman is simply a better match. 

Many radical feminists actually warn men against taking any sort of initiative towards women. Why is this? Because seeing another woman receive attention from a man causes the radical feminist psychological anguish!

Some heterosexual women are actually so insecure about their looks, that they mistakenly believe themselves to be asexual. They realize that they have no desire to be in a relationship, but the reason for this is because to enter a relationship would diminish the attention they receive from men, on which they by now psychologically depend.

So, is it great when guys constantly tell you you're pretty? No. There's also the problem of addiction. If you receive continual validation from people, you eventually become dependent upon the validation. It's fine to tell a girl she's pretty if you're dating her. Don't go on random good looking people's Youtube videos and tell it to them however, because they will grow addicted to unhealthy levels of validation.",MensRights

Having default equal custody is great and all, but only the legal father can apply for it.  If you're married, you pretty much always get a presumption of paternity.  But if you're not married, your rights as a father are dependent on whether or not the mother puts you down as the father. **AFAIK, this is a problem almost everywhere** (see [here](https://thoughtcatalog.com/janet-bloomfield/2015/04/5-reasons-no-man-should-marry-and-1-reason-he-might/) for example). Kentucky is working to fix this though.  Alberta also has a one year grace period where the father can attempt to establish paternity.

A few states have made progress in other areas.

###Arizona
In 2013, the state of Arizona passed a law that helps fathers in quite a few ways.  Courts are supposed to maximize the amount of time that both parents get with the kids.  And parents who try to do things like delay court hearings or ""mislead judges"" (which I assume means making things up to gain custody) get penalized.  This stands in stark contrast to the situation before 2013 where the gender of the parent was directly relevant in custody decisions (with the mother getting preferential treatment).

A 2017 bill would have established that equal parenting was in the best interests of the child, but it didn't pass.

###Kentucky
In 2017, Kentucky passed a law making equal custody the default for temporary custody arrangements.  This can only be overturned if the parents agree to something different, or if it could be proven that it wasn't in the best interests of the child.  This was considered important because initial custody arrangements often influence permanent arrangements.  

In 2018, a similar bill was passed for permanent custody, making Kentucky the first state ever to have these types of laws.

In 2019, a bill was proposed that would allow an unmarried father to be considered a parent, exactly the same as the mother, as soon as he can prove paternity.  As it is now, an unmarried mother can refuse to let the father establish paternity, which is basically a loophole around the above two bills.  Information about that can be found [here](https://fox17.com/news/local/local-dads-fighting-to-make-joint-custody-the-default).

###Areas with failed legislation
In Florida an equal custody bill was passed, but then vetoed by the governor due to pressures from NOW and other feminist lobbying groups.  There was a very large public backlash against this when it happened (see [here](https://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/gov-rick-scott-vetoes-controversial-alimony-bill/2273409)).

Something similar also happened in Minnesota.

Most of the Wikipedia article about this is basically a graveyard of failed proposals by various US states.  Outside the United States, Canada also had an equal custody proposal in 2014 that failed.

###Pending legislation
There are a few US states which have bills currently being looked at.  Italy also has an equal custody bill being looked at.  And while not perfect, Finland has a proposed bill that would force judges to ""consider"" 50 / 50 custody.

For clarity, an Affirmative debate only needs to focus on one of these countries to fulfill their burden of proof. They don't need to focus on all three.

As an adamant MRA, I like to do all that I can to spread the word on feminism's flaws and the issues which affect men. Unfortunately Feminism is a very widely accepted ideology in the debate community and I want to make sure that my students don't buy into it. I also see this as fantastic learning opportunity for other students who have simply accepted feminism as an acceptable moral paradigm.

I want to help guide my kids' research, but as a college student I don't have a whole lot of time to do this. I've read the evidence which warrants male disposability in the US and Canada, but I need to find a source that gives me those same numbers in either Cuba, Mexico or Venezuela. I have a framework that I'm toying around with to write the actual arguments, so I'm not looking for help in structuring the case. Instead, I need help finding the evidence to show that male disposability is a problem in these countries as well.

For those of you with no prior experience in Policy Debate, it is a very evidence-heavy format. It isn't uncommon for a team to enter a round with up to 8 tubs of evidence, a volume greater than an entire set of Encyclopedia Britannica. So please contribute as much evidence as you can for this.

**:edit:** This came out completely wrong, and I need to apologize for the way I've framed this post. Several of you have stated that I am in the wrong for trying to have my kids run this case because of my own beliefs. You're right. There's no two ways around it, you're right and I've stuck my foot in my mouth. I wrote this post at 3am and just wanted to get this request out there before I forgot about it. 

That said, I'm working with limited resources. I should have clarified that my two varsity debaters don't fully understand how a prima facie case works just yet, and are wanting to run Kritikal affs in a region that barely understands how a K functions. I'm working with them to write this case, and I don't come from a Policy background myself. I thought this kind of case would be a good way to allow them to run the type of arguments they wanted to run, kritikal arguments, in a way that would satisfy most of the judges around here.

I'm actually not even their coach proper. I'm a college kid who does consultant work with them once a week. Their coach has no debate background and was given the class simply because she is the speech teacher. I though this would be good ground to build a case since it was something I knew about, and since it would be in line with the kinds of arguments they're wanting to run.

I don't want to indoctrinate my students. However I also don't want them to encounter feminist arguments with no frame of reference for an alternative. They're working really hard to be good at this event, and I'm working hard to be a dependable and knowledgeable resource for them.

**:edit 2:** Apparantly this thread has been posted to a facebook page for NDT/CEDA. To clarify, I am an MRA and I do believe feminism is harmful. That said, I would never superimpose my beliefs onto my students. I love debate, but my background simply isn't a policy one. I went to a small AAA high school and taught myself most of what I know. This is a subreddit for men's rights, and the community standards are that men's needs aren't provided for in the status quo, and (for some) that feminism is unethical moral framework focused on victimizing women at the most basic level.

For those among the debate community who have no experience with MRA though, I would highly Suggest Karen Straughan's video 'Feminism and the disposible male' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp8tToFv-bA

Straughan makes several arguments which are widely accepted int he MRA movement.

The argument of feminism's legitimacy is mute however. Now that I've gotten the attention of NDT/CEDA debaters, I would love your insight and assistance as I embark into the new world of debate. Debate has opened up whole new worlds for me, and I love it more and more every day. That said, CX is hard and I make mistakes when researching it to teach my debaters... Like, a lot.

I'm opposed to doing my debater's research for them, and the purpose of my posting this thread was to get discuss this issue with those who are well versed in it. The case I'm wanting to help them make would be one that follows a basic stock-issue structure; Inherency, Plan, Advantages.

The Inherency is that feminism, as the most mainstream school of though on gender issues, doesn't meet the needs of men. This in turns leads to male disposability (men have few violence shelters, automatic female custody, high workplace mortality, lack of representation in domestic violence reports, etc. etc.)

A quick skimming though this subreddit will show you these problems exist, however they are represented here mainly through the US and Canada. I wanted to know about domestic violence trends in Mexico, the number of battered womens' shelters compared to even general mens' shelters, and how male disposibility pans out there.

The plan would be to open a number of battered mens' shelters through one of the resolutional countries.

Advantages would include, among other things, changing the way we see gender egalitarianism and solving for violence against men in these countries.

The kritikal literature would come into play in the inherency arguments without actually being a K itself. The coach I work for wants to make sure that our varsity debaters have a case that can be successful in UIL, but my boys really want to run Kritikal arguments.

1363124720.0,Why do women hate men? What is the source of female misandry?,"I have been giving this a lot of thought over the past few months: If, as I am beginning to understand, women were never historically *oppressed* per se by men, where did the feminist dogma ""all women are eternally oppressed everywhere by men"" come from?

More to the point, I get the impression that the vast majority of women on earth, no matter the culture, seem to have some sort of deep, almost primal resentment toward men.  

So, where does this hatred come from, if not from some sort of racial memory of oppression? 

 The hate is quite real; we can see it whenever men are hurt or ridiculed all over the world; Knees to the balls are a sort of universal comedy. The story of a king (or chief) brought low is considered tragedy by men, but sly humor by women. An entire NATION of women were reduced to gasping hysterical laughter at the thought of a woman cutting off a man's penis. I've seen *mothers* smile surreptitiously at each other when their OWN SONS are doubled over on a soccer field from kicked in the scrota by a female teammate.
So SOMETHING is going on here.

Where does it come from? Is it some sort of runaway inferiority complex? Is it hatred of their own bodies and jealousy of men's (seemingly) greater freedom?

>Feminism is becoming a bad word, but it's just a word. It's not really important to reclaim that word.

You're right, but it is important to differentiate [what I call feminism] from what [people here tend to call feminism]. The words, as you say, aren't really important. I was wrong to stress that they were. The reason it's important to make this distinction is that people here read all of the negative things about ""feminism"" and get a seriously misguided world-view. This world-view is

1. Harmful to our cause of men's rights activism

2. Potentially harmful to some of our relationships with women

and should therefore be refined to reflect the truth: that what we call ""feminism"" here is often just a group of anti-man, female-supriority activism. It is not the whole picture, even though it's easy to assume that it is.

This is the essence of my argument as it stands, refined by the criticisms I have received here.

----------
Another edit: if you are a newcomer to this thread and think what I'm saying is total garbage, please read the comments.

EDIT: I'm being downvoted because I'm being misunderstood. Many have made the entirely legitimate argument that **what everybody calls feminism is feminism**, and what authority do I have to say what it ""really is?"" 
First of all, this is like saying a bunch of kids who learn 4 chords on the guitar to impress their friends ""guitarists."" They can call themselves guitarists all they want, **and they would be wrong**. Perhaps ""philosopher"" is a better example: you can come up with bullshit all day about the meaning of life or whatever, but that doesn't make you a philosopher.

If you want to use ""feminism"" to describe the hateful and anti-man efforts of one group of women, then that's fine. But the links below are the real deal. The professionals. If you're still hung up on the word though, just call what I'm talking about something else!! What I'm trying to highlight is a conceptual distinction.

-----------------------------

Many of us, indignant about the disgusting assaults on the freedoms and equality of men, see ""feminism"" as the perpetrator. The reason for this is that the women (and men) who promote anti-man attitudes use this word to describe themselves--they call themselves ""feminists."" In many cases, they're wrong. 

It takes more than being anti-man to be feminist. It takes more than being *pro-woman* to be feminist. So many women who think they're feminists are just playing the vicious and self-defeating game of identity politics. Feminism is not just civil rights--it requires an appreciation of the social construction of gender, the institutional structure of oppression, and the psychological nature of the relationship between men and women. Furthermore, you're not a feminist if all you do is whine--just like you're not civil rights activist if you think black people are nice--true feminists will *act* to promote equality, and often this means going against the grain of what is standard and normative for their gender. That's why there are comparatively few actual feminists, compared to what you might first assume. 
 
Finally, people misunderstand ""equality,"" the goal of feminism. Equality does not mean equal circumstances and treatment all the time. Men and women are *biologically different*, and will always have different personalities, different desires/needs, and different roles in society. **Gender equality means that both genders are able to live their own lives to the fullest extent, freely and authentically.**

Here are some links for reference. 

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-approaches/

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism

Finally, in the name of good intellectual habits, if you think this is all wrong, *please say why*. I'll admit I'm wrong if it is demonstrated that I am. No issue is black and white, and I've glossed over a great deal of intricacy here.

This is my first post to this community (and reddit). This community has interested me enough to throw off my lurker status so please read entirely before down-voting.

The sociological definition of feminism: 

-The belief that men -and- women should have  the same rights, legal privileges, and legal representation in government.

-Women -and- men should earn equal pay for equal work.

-Neither women -nor- men should be seen as inferior because of their sex or gender.

-Neither women -nor- men should be victims of abuse or maltreatment because of their sex or gender.

-Men -and- women should have to freedom to choose their path in life without fear of social ostracism.


I am a feminist. 


And, if you agree with the beliefs above, you may be too, though you may scoff at the associations that word brings with it. There has been a movement in the past few decades to reclaim this term but it seems to have become a synonym for ""women's rights"". 


Perhaps a better word for this set of beliefs is 'humanism'.




My gender is female. 
I graduated with honors from university with a degree in History and minors in Anthropology and Sociology.
In the fall, I will attend graduate school on track to earning a Ph. D. In the Sociology of Gender.
I will be studying men, the cultural ideas and representations of 'masculinity' in advertisements and popular culture, men's rights,  and the narrowing of the already limited male role set in our current society.  


The reason I am making this post is because I am a scholar, a feminist and a woman who is completely in support of the mission statement of this community; I believe it has great cultural, political and scholarly significance. 


That being said, I wanted to see how open this community is to a feminist (in the true sense of the word) using it as a think-tank of sorts. In my future posts, I plan to ask for the feelings and opinions of the redditors of Men's Rights on different topics and issues which will hopefully lead to national publications and more recognition for the Men's Rights movement and true feminism.

Let me know if this is complete bullshit or marginally workable.

I think that seduction is the same, functionally and morally, as intimidation. I'm going to use heterosexual interactions for examples, but these could apply to homosexual interactions as well.

I'll start with functionally: seduction aims to use a man's desire against him by giving him the possibly false impression that he may have sexual relations with the seducer. By doing so he may make decisions that he might not otherwise make (buying a drink at a bar, paying for a purse, etc.) Intimidation does the same; the prospect of physical, monetary or emotional pain subjects the subordinate into doing things they might not otherwise do. Both of these options result in the same consequence of the dominant one convincing the subordinate that it is in their best interest to do something that is not in their best interest.

Now morally: the main claim against male intimidation is that men, on average bigger and stronger, are being unjust by asserting a natural superiority. By doing so they have an unfair disadvantage. But sexually, don't women have that same power? Men are genetically predisposed to look for mating opportunities in all women, and when a woman presents that opportunity, even the most iron-willed man could fall prey. Women don't face that same situation; their requisite near-monogamy (because they can only have one child at a time, they are more selective in their sexual selections) means that male seduction does not hold the same sway. I think everyone here can identify a situation in which they or others have given undue attention or favor to a woman who seems a possible sexual partner. Doesn't that result in the same affect as intimidation?

1445698631.0,"We should be Pro-Men, not Anti-Women","So I recently have a very difficult conversation when a friend and I debated gender rights. I'll spare you all the details, suffice it to say that I ~~was~~ felt (I believe unfairly) lumped into the category of ""woman-hating, sexist, male douchebags."" The sad part is, I understood why she would do that. There is a notably large group of men that both fall into the above category and identify as MRAs. At one point during said argument I had to take to time to explain the difference between /r/MensRights and /r/theRedPill. It really bothered me that aligning myself with /r/MensRights meant also being considered a red piller. I think it's imperative that we, as a community, take steps to make clear that our message is about advancing men's rights, as opposed to producing hate speech against women/feminists.

There are a two major themes I think we need to consider when making posts here: ""Does this help advance men's rights?"" and ""Is this post going to isolate us from non-partisan readers?"" Here are a few examples.

**Posts that say ""This woman would have been treated differently if she were in a man.""** Often times this is in regards to jail time. Also often times it's in a situation where most would agree that a man in the same situation shouldn't be jailed either (even if it's technically against the law). Regardless, it doesn't help men's rights to raise our pitchforks and go about hunting women to throw in jail.

**posts that say ""Feminists are dumb and we should throw rocks at them.""** Feminists are not dumb. A feminist might be dumb, but that doesn't mean s/he is representative of the entire movement. Maybe one did make a ridiculous tweet that said ""we should kill or white men"" or some such. Yes, that was stupid, but the vast majority of feminists don't believe that. Claiming that these examples are representative of the whole of feminism is just us producing feminist hate speech. Also, yes some feminists do the same thing to us, that doesn't mean we should engage them.

**General rape apologetics.** This is a tricky subject. For example, there might be a post about how a guy was accused of rape and it ruined his life. However we are only hearing one side of the story. We can all identify with how horrible it is to be falsely accused of rape. The hard part of it is making a determination as to whether the OP is actually innocent. Just keep in mind, it's a post on Reddit, there is a high probability you are not getting some important details of the story. The absolute last thing we want, as a movement, is to be considered to be pro-rape.

Some good examples:

**Posts that say ""Here is a new law/thing/etc. that is good for men's rights.""** Specifically I remember some post about a new male rape center in (?)Sweden. Identifying positive measures is good for us. It gives us a structure. Another example of this might be a new law that recognizes men as equal to women where it didn't before.

**Examples of verifiable things that hurt men's rights.** These might be things like links to statistics that show how reality is different than perception (EG showing that male DV victims are nearly the same as female victims, or that the gender pay gap doesn't exist). Also, things like proven misandry (hiring processes that take only women when men should be included too, actual (not assumed) false rape allegations, etc.).

**Discussion posts such that we, as a community, can decide, or better understand, what we are working towards.""** Like this one.  Or maybe someone wants to more clearly define what we, as a community should try to do to combat anti-male legislation (such as alimony).

Fellow subscribers to /r/MensRights, this is a request. Please help to ensure that our movement is seen in a positive light.

Over time, her damsel in distress cries have accelerated, and tonight she clear out asked me to escort her back to her apartment after she finished working out because ""my daughter and I are home all alone."" I said ""no"" and left the gym, and she started to get all huffy.

The feminist mythology at play tonight, however, seemed obvious to me, and I'm astonished that more people don't see it:

There was not a single female villain in the movie, despite the society being diverse and meritocratic enough to allow a resourceful woman to become a hero like Furiosa. There should be strong women peppering their ranks, including the soldiers. The villains were exclusively male, represented by disfigured, middle-aged stand-ins for business (the guy wearing the suit and pants who ran the refinery) and the military-industrial complex (the old guy in the tank.)- two classic punching bags representing 'Patriarchy.'


The escaped women are the most treasured, and the most important, figures in the film. All other heroes risk their lives to protect these women, despite these women having done nothing to earn that loyalty. (Indeed, all they've done is to turn their back on what, to most people, would seem like a pretty charmed life- Food, shelter, water, hygiene. No, obviously not an ideal situation, but humanity's against the ropes, and their quality of life was simply unimaginable to most of the humans in the film. They were princesses fleeing what was certainly a dehumanizing situation, still one that many/most would have traded their own for in a heartbeat in this apocalyptic world.) They were worth dying for because they were women; meanwhile, men die by the dozens around them.

You might suggest that there were strong, sympathetic males in the movie in the form of Max and the War Boy- Those characters began as animals. Max, understandably mentally twisted into a survival machine, communicated in grunts until his sympathy for Furiosa 'civilized' him and he finally earned the removal of his symbolic muzzle. The sympathetic War Boy was the hand of the enemy, and out for his own glorious, murderous death, until the values of the (religious) Patriarchal society failed him and he was able to console to one of the escaped women.

I know, this is sounding pretty extreme and off-the-hook. The basic pieces of the Feminist narrative are all in place, though- White men in control of society (usually *literally* white.) Women on the run from power-mad males seeking to control their sexuality; Good male allies available, but only after being 'tamed' to serve them; Femininity/ism as the obvious solution to the problems of a world ruined by men.

I understand that consultant to the film Eve Ensler has seen parts of the world, and the humanitarian horrors therein, that I can only imagine.  I don't doubt that the society in the MM:FR could (quite) loosely mirror the social structures of warlord-controlled populations in third world countries. Those situations, yes, are effectively illuminated by the spotlight that the feminist narrative can provide. The fact that the society of MM:FR may to some degree resemble real societies (""societies"",) doesn't change the fact that those horror stories from the other side of the world *are* described by the Feminist mythology, just as MM:FR does.

Perhaps that's my avenue for enjoying this film- To see it not as the preaching of 3rd Wave Feminism, but as an allegory to the terrible circumstances of millions of women in the worst parts of the world, and a very possible, very terrible future for all of us.

Nevertheless, I felt the finger pointing right at me.

I also just want to let a lot of people on here know that feminism really is equality, not women > men, and any good (real) feminist should fight for many of the issues I’ve seen on here, like laws that state men can’t be rape victims, men losing child custody battles, and male mental health issues and stereotypes of men. 

I think more feminists (and men’s rights activists) should be more open to working together and stop seeing each other as enemies, because at the end of the day, we are all working towards the same goal: equality. 

Thanks for listening to my stupid rant. TLDR: good feminists and MRA are working towards a lot of the same goals, so let’s work together

1366193935.0,An Open Letter to Paul Elam; Please Take Down Register-Her.com,"Paul,

As far as I know, you and I have never had a conversation. I imagine, though, that we share a lot of values. I believe very strongly in the value of equality. I think you do too. I am very angry that I live in a society that treats me as a disposable utility only valued for the resources and entertainment that he provides to others. I think you are too. I want things to change. I want them to get better. I think that you want those things too. I think that my posting history on /r/mensrights speaks for itself and supports my dedication to participating in the gender debate. I'm never PC, and I have a nose for bullshit that would make a matador proud. 


The work that you've done with AVFM is tremendous. You've put your name out there. You've put your time and money into it. You've risked your good name to demand a place in society, as equals, not just for yourself but for me too. Thank you for that. Your devotion as an op-ed columnist, activist, and organizer has given voice to the silenced. You've encouraged people to speak openly and honestly about their experience, even if what they have to say isn't very nice or pretty. That's my kind of expression. Having AVFM and /r/mr available as a hub for conversation, commiseration, and support has probably saved lives. Nothing encourages suicidal ideation like isolation, loneliness, and ostracization. Your work has directly diminished the isolation and loneliness that makes checking out seem like a good idea to me sometimes. AVFM hasn't just been a rallying point for disenfranchised men who society still insists carry privileges that most men never see. AVFM has also been a rallying point for the women who support those men and their right to equality. Those women have been bold. They've been brave. They've been delightfully transgressive. They've been everything that feminists demand they be, only better. Because they continued to think critically. Watching Girlwriteswhat's videos has had the same effect on the physical pain in my heart that a shot of demerol might have to a shattered kneecap. Typhonblue is starting to come into her own. With a little work, she stands to fulfill some great potential. And Erin. Where would *any* of us, MRA or feminist be without Erin? Her gentility, her intelligence, her strength, her generosity all remind me of the woman who taught me to read and set the pace for my intelligence as a toddler, my maternal grandmother. Unfortunately, my grandmother died when I was very young and Erin is the first woman I've seen carry herself like she did since.


The media is finally starting to notice us. More importantly, the media is starting to notice *you*. We're at a historical nexus point in the gender debate. Things are coming together. We are coming upon an opportunity to make things better for everyone, both MRA and feminist. If we can seize that moment and treat it with the value it needs, we may actually get to see a world that treats us better then cannon fodder *within our lifetime*. I would really really like that. I would really like to be able to express myself without being shouted down and silenced for questioning the dominant social paradigm. I've lost a lot of myself over the course of my life because of that silencing, and I would like those parts of myself back.


The thing is, Paul, if I'm going to get those parts of myself back, if *you* are going to get those parts of yourself back, we are going to need feminists to recognize the value of our message. As a figurehead for the MRM, we need you to behave with a certain amount of decorum. We need that so that we can't be easily dismissed and silenced further. Register-her is like using IEDs. It's undignified. It's unnecessary. It is a go to silencing and dismissing reference for feminists right now. That doesn't mean that I think you should stop writing op-eds that critique the likes of Amanda Marcotte, Rebecca Watson or their progenitors Solanis, Dworkin, Steinem, and Friedan. But I don't need a database for that. While I wouldn't consider RH a dox, I would consider it too close for comfort. We can do better than that. You can do better than that. RH is dividing us.


Pretty much every mystic out there believes that in order to affect change in the world, one must make a significant sacrifice of themselves. Given the proximity of the historical nodal point that I mentioned earlier, I think that it is time for that sacrifice. I think RH should be that sacrifice; a casting off of childish things so that this idea may grow to maturity. MRA's and feminists are like Israel and Palestine. They fight and fight and bicker and pick at each other while constantly expecting the other to extend an olive branch. Every time I see another development in that conflict I think ""will one of you *please* be the bigger man here?"". But they never are. We should learn from that.


Paul, I am asking you not just from one man to another, but from one human to another, to please make the sacrifice. Be the bigger man. Take down Register-Her.com and watch things change. Trust me.

I also have a small conundrum for r/mensrights. Say you were at a party and went to sleep in a bed. And woke up some hours later with a girl riding you, what would you do? I think my immediate response in the heat of the moment (realizing I'm being raped) would be to break their nose. Afterwards I would call the police and try and get them charged with rape.

Does your answer, whatever it was, change with whether you knew the girl or not? What about if she was your girlfriend? I imagine I would be okay if I woke up to someone I loved, cared for and trusted was riding me - but a stranger.. noooope. You don't know what protection they have or possible STD's.

My only fear is, thanks to Feminism and their 'rape culture' - it would be almost impossible to get the girl done for rape, despite a male would be destroyed in the court in the reverse situation. You'll probably be charged with assault for punching your rapist :/

It has to be asked who hits the evolutionary jack pot ? who are the males who know how the female/male dynamics work out, an throw aside all this ""nice guy"" bullshit. They are usually the irresponsible males, the bad boys.

If a young American man gets drunk, mouths off to some strangers and gets his ass kicked, do the police pursue that kind of case vigorously? Your typical cop would tell a guy to learn how to keep his mouth shut and stay away from thugs, then simply file a police report and forget about the matter.

Or in the FPS genre where there is voice chat, how suddenly everything becomes focused on that one girl in the game.

In real world sports, women always have their own branch or sport, female soccer, female volleyball, etc. because they are genetically physically weaker. And that's exactly as it should be! Just because men have an advantage physically doesn't mean women shouldn't be able to play sport competitively.

That's the real world, but in the online world men are at a psychological disadvantage. So why can't men be allowed to wish to play without women? I mean unfortunately their mere presence is ruining the game for the men playing it. It sucks for both genders, but that's just how it is.

The beautiful thing about online gaming is that you rarely have to give out your real life identity, so actually having two separate games for each gender isn't needed. But in the places where you can reveal your gender I would wish for females to try to hide it as much as possible. I don't think females shouldn't use voice chat as that's often the only way to communicate, but at least try to avoid it if possible. Although the voice chat problem will probably go away in time when voice filters are more and more introduced, but it still doesn't prevent someone from revealing their gender.

**tl;dr: men go crazy around women so why can't men be allowed to play games without them?**

Also, I'm not sure if I break the last rule, but I don't want to talk about such a controversial topic with my main and I just don't have an old alt account to use. Sorry :/

**Edit:** to clear things up, I don't think anyone should be excluded for any reason. If voice chat is the only way to communicate, then everyone should be allowed to use it. However I think that when women are stating their gender when it's not needed, it should be seen as exploiting a weakness in guys. And if guys then complain about it it shouldn't be seen as misogyny.",MensRights

* 6) After 30 minutes a nurse comes at me with the other woman behind her, looking at me like I raped her, and asked me to leave the room with a tone of voice I wouldn't use with a thief

 
* 7) I exited the room and they all looked bad at me


 
* 8) The woman never even spoke to me once or to my GF

Conclusion: If she is afraid to even change her clothes in the next room to a man it means that men are viruses and I might get her infected

And to think than this woman will probably go under the knife in an hour and two men will stick a rubber hose up her femininity to make her piss.

**UPDATE**: Being internet less  all day till now, not so bad.  My GF talked for hours with the ""woman"" and apparently she has some serious problem, so I guess that's why she was so ...

Later I was using my laptop without a internet connection playing around since there was nothing to do, and at the same small table there was the stuck up niece of that ""woman"" and when the ""woman"" woke up from surgery she said: ""how cute both of you with computers"" and her niece  got totally red on her face.

I got the girl's name, Vale :) and cellphone, I don't feel one inch guilty about it and next Saturday if she doesn't change her mind, we are going together to a sauna spa 100 km from here.

Talking to a feminist about MRA issues is like talking to a Christian fundamentalist as an atheist.,"So I just made the mistake of checking out a subreddit where you ask feminists stuff and someone said something along the lines of ""Women: never more likely to be victims of ANYTHING than men.""

So I replied that men beat out women for murders, rapes, violent crimes, workplace deaths, wartime casualties, homelessness, imprisonment (both in prison population and jail-time for the same crimes), suicide... and only trail in domestic violence at a 60/40 split. And technically men also sorely trail in victim awareness.  And when someone tried to call bullshit I googled it and linked a half dozen articles.

The amount of hate and ignorance I received was just disgusting.

Hello, this is lady_catherine speaking. Boy, haven't we had our rough spots over the last month or so, huh? I doubt you all are going to believe this but... I am hardly a misandrist. I am indifferent to most men as I am pretty sure that most men are indifferent to women. That is human nature.

When I written that letter to you all in r/mensrights, it was a sarcastic exaggeration of my attitudes towards men(and a purposeful strawman both ways). It was trolling pure and simple. The fact that people take it seriously and think it's represenitive of feminist attiudes saddens me.

I am sympathetic to some men's issues and there are some that I find to be quite frankly bullshit. When I posed as a MRA for about half of a year, I was exposed to many different ideas and changed some of my pre-conceptions of gender dynamics, there are some among you that if they were anarchists I would consider them comrades, albeit somewhat misguided and there are others among you that ruin the movement.

Again, I don't hate you, even if you are a white, cis, heterosexual able-bodied man. I don't even hate your movement, I am rather critical of it, sure, but I think it's misguided and unfortunately at some type of tug o' war between right-wing traditionalists, libertarians, and liberals (maybe a few socialists and other forms of leftists), that creates the atmosphere of bigotry that pervades your movement.

I will continue to be critical of your movement, but I will refrain from misandry when I do so. Letting my withdrawals get the best of me is not an excuse for hate, snapping out, or screaming at anyone.

Thank you all for reading this and I mean this seriously, please have a pleasant day.

Your friendly neighborhood radical anarchist feminist,

1659255394.0,I think this sub might be getting out of hand a bit.,"Let me explain myself here. I am all for Mens rights and it makes logical sense most of the discussions here. Though a recent post has made me question the subs validate.

&#x200B;

A poll has been done about if women have it better then men now, and well most of the response was for the idea that women have it better then men now.

I understand how this could work in the west, yes in USA and most European countries Women have it better than men. But all around the world? now thats where I doubt, are there still problems in other parts of the world such as male genital mutilation (circumcision), rape /sexual assault /harassment /domestic violence for men not being taken as seriously as for women, the idea that men have to be the breadwinner, Men being falsely accused, Men having to work in dangerous jobs because they're men and etc.

&#x200B;

I understand all of that, but it's not like women have it any easier there too. Women are seen as less valuable then men, Women are told to be completely obedient to the man, Women are more often raped/sexually assaulted, Women have some rights stripped away from them, Women are seen as less suitable for work because they're women and etc.

&#x200B;

I feel that some people are forgetting that feminism didn't start because there was no problem, it started because there was an issue, the issue was women didn't have all their rights.

&#x200B;

Edit: I will clarify some things here or try to. I understand in USA and most if not all of European countries, women have it better than men. I understand that. I am not angry that this sub doesn't the oppression of women in eastern countries/Africa and Asia, no. I am just annoyed more that on the poll that asked if women had it better or worse then men, when points mentioning that women in Asia/Africa have it worse then men, would make you be insulted and points would be ignored. That's why I made the post.",MensRights

1617529474.0,You have no right to equity or equality. You only have God given right to pursue happiness.,"In the United States the equality, equity discussion stems from socialist-communist roots. The Founding Fathers long resolved this question.

To maximize individual freedom you can only seek to insure one’s right to pursue happiness. Anything else begins to remove individual freedom and liberty.

Example: Government promulgates law saying I cannot discriminate when renting my private property. In other words, the government limits my individual freedom under guise of equity and equality. There are countless examples of this decay in individual freedom.

So the question is not about equity or equality because ultimately there is no general guarantee of equity or equality among human individuals. My IQ is 120 plus. Must I lower it to match the moron’s 70 IQ?

Maybe I don’t approve of lesbian woman. Must I be forced to allow them into my private property because I seek rental income? There are to many examples to list.

The point is the basic God given RIGHT to pursue happiness is being removed under the false premise of EQUALITY and equity. 

So men, time to remove your dick and balls and begin hormone therapy. And if your white either kill yourself or darken your skin pigmentation. In addition, be prepared to give up your savings, private property and personal production.

There are less than 90 women in congress and less than 20 women in the senate, so I guess the answer is men. Who are the people enforcing these laws? Men. Who are the district attorneys filing charges? Men. Who are the assistant district attorneys prosecuting the charges? Men, as well.

Also, that men are so victimized and being born a woman is like hitting the jackpot, that they have it oh so easy, they don't have anything to worry about. That's just ridiculous. Can anyone say to me that there are unique hardships that men and women face and these hardships are probably equal? Like I've said, I've written off feminism.

Posts where scientific facts are actively denied, where women are reduced to their body count, where women are potrait as people who dont have to suffer at all, posts where people blame women with skimpish outfits that they got sexually harrassed and overall just a lot of toxicisty and negativity.

3) In UK/US for example, women are far far better off than in other countries, however just because it is worse off elsewhere it does not mean it isn’t needed at home. 

4) Feminism is essentially a strand of egalitarianism. Yes there is a very very small handful women who may believe women are superior and misunderstand feminism, but it is a minority. You hear about it more in the media because it is more interesting to hate things, for example any muppets who pay attention or care about what Katie Hopkins or other similar people say. They’re famous for a reason, it’s interesting to get angry.

5) You shouldn’t be ashamed to be a feminist. I wouldn’t look for reasons to not be a feminist any more than I would look for reasons to not be a racist. You don’t have to personally attempt to bring about radical social reform. I’m not a campaigner against racism, I’m just not a racist.

>  
>\-Anonymous

So, as you can tell by the title, I genuinely feel like the Feminism of today is around as bad as, maybe even worse than, the KKK. I say this for multiple reasons, several of which are listed below.

First off, as stated in the quote above, the most dangerous monsters are smart enough to not be scary. The context of that quote is when a storm chaser was talking about diabetes, heart disease, and global warming. He was asked something along the lines of ""How do you live in tornado alley, knowing that a monster tornado can drop out of the sky at a moment's notice?"". I feel like this also correlates to modern Feminism, because Feminism is far smarter than the KKK.

One of the reasons why Feminism is smarter than the KKK is because the KKK were very open about how much of a threat they were. Feminism, on the other hand, doesn't admit to any atrocities they commit, such as supporting false accusations, circumcision, and trying to get companies to overpay women, and when they do, they paint it as a good thing because ""Bad man, Man bad"". They are supported in this trait by not only their innocent and pure history, but also by the simping plague going around on twitter because of the internet.

Another reason I believe Feminism is smarter than the KKK is because they know where to hit men where it hurts the most. Men are biologically and historically built to withstand physical pain, while being able to dish back the most physical pain themselves. On the contrary, Women are built to deal emotional pain. This supports the feminist movement greatly: it gives Women a direct access card to men's weak spot. Men strive off of compliments and emotional support, so when a Feminist insults and ridicules Men, the Men are dealt a critical blow.

What makes Feminism the scariest, at least in comparison to the KKK, is how large and fast they are growing. We are currently situated in an environment where hate groups can grow the fastest, and be stopped the slowest, all because of the World Wide Web. Billions of people use the internet, and only a tens of millions of people at the highest moderate it. When combined with how physically isolated that makes people, it turns into a planet-sized petri dish in which Feminism is the top of the food chain.

Allow me to make a comparison, really quickly, for specifically those who know about a game called Plague Inc.. If you're experienced in the game, or have watched those who are, you'll know that generally the best strategy is to spread around the entire world undetected and then spike your lethality once you infect at least 95% of the world.

 If we use that for a basis, the KKK are the plague that starts off getting symptoms, and is eradicated after infecting generally less than half of the global population, and killing around 5 to 10% of it. Feminism is the plague that hides in all of us and gets terrible symptoms once it's infected everybody.

 Right now, evidenced by how openly accepting we are of Kill All Men and the MeToo movement, we are at the stage of the game in which it is just now evolving killer traits. If we let it go on for too long, we'll all be subject to genocidal situations, civil war, total political unrest, and a whole slew of similar things, until eventually...

...it's game over, for all of us.

What will happen if Feminism wins, you might ask? What will men be subject to if we don't stand up for ourselves?

Everything you can imagine in some sort of vision of hell-on-earth. Human domestication, male slavery, mental distraught, totalitarianism, complete lack of male education, men-only workforces, men becoming no more than property, **EVERYTHING.**

If things keep going the way they're going, I say it'll take at least 10, at most 50, years for all of that to become a reality.

I claimed that the LGBT movement does in fact groom children.  And that progressives pick and choose which sexual assult to give a damn about.   

Here is my story.   I'm a 34 yr old Philipino, Hispanic, French, and Finnish man in the United States.  About 25 years ago my babysitter took my virginity. We will call this person N.  I'm not signifanctly injured or anything, but I do know I have some emotional baggage from being effectively raped at about 10 years old.  She was about 13 at the time.  I have been preyed on by her a few times through the years.  Again at about 16 and again at about 25. She has this gross grip on me, that when she wants me she knows how to get me in bed. It's strange and very troubling like I'm her quilty little candy she eats In secret when she wants.  Every time she finds out I have a new girlfriend she insists on meeting her and telling her the story of how I lost my virginity.  

Here's where I may be the asshole.  I had a girlfriend let's call her K. K got the awkward story from N.  K spent the rest of the evening yelling at me for letting N talk to her? Wondering if I'm still sleeping with N.  She told me I needed to report N. 
Well, I called K a controlling bitch. And told her to leave it in the past. 
She asked me if I'm OK with being raped? I asked her *quite angrily* I AM OK ARENT I ?!?! she looked at me and said maybe not.  I made her leave and we broke up soon after.  




And here's the other part of my story.  In high school we had a club called the gay straight alliance.  I was raised by filipino dad and finnish mother that hate is learned.  And love is natural.  With these good lessons in my repitior, I figured I would enjoy the GSA and have lots of friends.   I noticed however that as white presenting cisgendered straight male, I wasn't ever really part of the conversation.   Every time I told my story of losing my virginity to my friends in the GSA. I was told to be proud of it.  What a stud I am.  And they never even wanted to know who she was.  Soooooo I thought about and said ""I could kiss guys"" to myself.  So I tried it.  I made a point of explaining to my friends that I am bisexual.  I was so proud of my coming out.  And I got all  kinds of validation and a lot of positive attention for it. Way more than I ever got as a.stright wite male.  I continued this mascarde presenting myself as bi just to be included.  Until one day I was on a date with a girl, and we stopped by a mutual friends house. He kissed me on the lips.  I Stanly rembering my training I asked for another one right in front of the girl I was on a date with.  It was awkward after that because he didn't know I was on a date with this girl. Let's call her R.  After we got back in my car I looked at her and said ...... yeah I'm not bi.

Men's issues require advocates, because society, the media, and feminism, which purports to be an egalitarian movement and is influential in legislation (VAWA), law enforcement (duluth model), and academia (feminist sociology courses, feminism courses, gender studies, women's studies courses), does not address men's issues in a meaningful way (and in many ways, actively harms them).

1356298584.0,1 out of everyone 1.2 men raped or sexually assaulted by 18,"The title is meant to be inflammatory but also accurate. The statistic commonly bandied about, ""1 in 4 women in the US will be raped or sexually assaulted"" contains the same type of lie, conflating 'rape' and 'sexual assault' together.

The CDC reports the risk of rape for men, outside of prison, is about the same as the risk women face (1.2% iirc). The cdc doesn't take into account prison rape, and statistics aren't readily available, but it is probably safe to assume the rape culture surrounding prisons puts men ahead of women when it comes to the risk for rape.

But that's not what the title is about. I want to hightlight 2 areas I think have been overlooked and highlight the second class nature of men and the shortfall of statistics and the hypocrisy of political narratives and social justice.

1) 20-80 percent of men in North America have been sexually mutilated. If this was FGM there would be little to no question that this is sexual assault. 

2) I think, nearly all men, have been kicked in the balls at some point. Many women relish in the idea, have done it, and have a story about that ones time...

1433261137.0,Problems with the Men's Rights Movement.,"First let me say that I am against New-Age Western Feminism, white-knights, and the idea of the ""Blue-Pill"". I grew up with a verbal/mental/physically abusive mother who was a hardcore Second-Wave Feminist and a father who was the very definition of a white-knight.  I was also overweight for most of my adolescence and couldn't even get a date until I lost most of my weight.  Even the girls who couldn't get a date to save their lives used to reject me.  Due to growing up in this environment I developed some extreme misogynistic feelings towards women.  I outgrew these feelings as I eventually began to have better experiences with women both in and out of the dating world.  

Soon after this I discovered the Men's Rights Movement (MRM) online.  I read blog posts, articles, and other material posted by men as well as women from around the world.  It was nice to see a group standing up for men who used to suffer in silence.  However over the past few months I've found it hard to relate to the movement as a whole due to some of the trends I've seen from activists that have pull within the movement. I feel that if these trends continue the movement for men's rights will eventually shut down, leaving boys and men to suffer in silence once again.

These trends include:

A. Constantly writing articles that attack women in regards to dating, sex, marriage, and rejection.

- These articles do nothing at all to further men's rights, and very few them include information that can help men.

B. Constantly attacking/criticizing Feminists in a nonproductive manner.

- I used to be in favor of this until I saw just how much this turned people off of whatever was being discussed.  Feminists are guilty of doing this exact same thing to the men's rights movement as well, and they are losing support because of it.  I feel that if mMen's Rights Activists (MRA's) focused their arguments more towards the specific issues at hand instead of criticizing Feminist more people would be open to hearing what they have to say.

- Also many of the articles that I have read attack feminists as well as women in general in viscous and unnecessary ways, making it hard for some to support the MRM even if they agree with it's views.  As an ex-misogynist I completely understand where these hostile feelings are coming from, I even agree with some of things that been done and said by certain MRA's.  But these actions hurt the movement nonetheless.

C. Focusing on pointless issues.

-  I see this problem the most.  MRA's will focus on something that does not effect Men in any way shape or form and will make mountain out of a mole hill.  An example of this would be the recent articles, criticisms, and attacks on the recently released Mad Max movie. As a filmmaker as well as screenwriter I can tell you that the meaning of a story is subjective to the person who watches it and will vary from person to person. So theoretically any film can be  seen as something that supports Feminism or MRM.  It just depends on the person.

D. Forgetting it's roots.

- It seems like lately MRA's are more focused on attacking Feminists than fighting for the rights of the men that claim to support.  An example would be some of the recent false-rape protests by MRA's on college campuses.  In some instances the protests go well, but others have gotten out of control. In one case MRA's decided to jam the phone services to a campus-rape hotline that people could call in case of an emergency. Instances like these make MRA's as well as men in general look bad in a system that already is stacked against them when it comes to rape accusations.  

E. MRA's have been dividing men as a whole instead of uniting them.

- This one speaks for itself.  With terms like alpha, beta, red-pill, and blue-pill it's easy to see why some men don't find a place in the MRM.

F. Too much talk, not enough action.

- MRA's need to take action.  They need to try to pass more legislation, organize more protests, and support issues that don't just concern themselves.  And if the MRM is already doing this then it needs to become more visible so people can see what it's about.
 
- Feminism suffers from this as well, however the MRM is not as main-stream as Feminism so it can't afford to make the same mistakes.

Sorry for the novel but even though I am not a member of the MRM I still  support what they are trying to accomplish.  I have been a victim of false rape accusations, I have been a victim of domestic violence at the hands of multiple women multiple times, and I have seen the lives of several men get destroyed by divorce/family courts one of which committed suicide afterwards. I can tell you that the men who suffer from these problems need the MRM.  I just hope the MRM doesn't fall from grace like Feminism has.",MensRights

1548116833.0,"My sister was sexually accosted during a work party; she behaved like an adult and didn't try to destroy the young man's life, but talked to him one and one; this is real female ""empowerment"".","TLDR; My sister's a mid-thirties doctor, has two children, loving husband who is a real estate agent, went to a work party absent her husband 'cause they couldn't find a sitter, got sexually accosted by a drunken resident who acted like a buffoon.  Instead of trying to destroy the young man's life (he's like ten years her junior) she sent an email to him the next day and said he acted inapproprately.  He apologized and said he had too much to drink and acted like an ass.  And that was it.  She didn't run crying to human resources and try to get the man fired, because she knew it would destroy his life.

Several of her female friends who witnessed the display told her that she should immediately run to HR and get this young man sent on his way to oblivion.  

Instead she said to me in a phone conversation that she ""doesn't want to ruin all this young man has worked for"" -- ""he had too much to drink and made a dumb mistake.""  How refreshing to hear this from my own sister -- it refreshes my faith in humanity, and makes me proud of my kin.  

She could have easily gotten this young man's life destroyed -- but she's been through med school, knows how hard it is, and didn't want to ruin a young man's life.   

This is how adults behave.  They don't run to HR and tattle tale like like little children, creating a ""snitch"" culture like the Soviet Union or people living under fascism.   I suspect that in most cases, these awkward sexual interactions can be dealt with just by talking to the person involved.   But feminism has created an awful situation in which the slightest supposed transgression can be viewed as sexual assault -- and they always run to the nearest authority figure/patriarch.   This isn't fair, since both men and women expect men to initiate.  

Now I will say one thing: based on my sister's account, this guy really was acting like a complete lout.  He's six foot four, my sister is about five foot three.  He even tried to pull down the zipper on her dress, but stopped as soon as she said ""fuck off.""   But ""fuck off"" is itself an example of real ""female empowerment"", because she told him to fuck off rather than running, crying to HR, like a child.  

I think my sister shows the way in the ""MeToo"" era.   Don't run to HR like a little kid; talk to the man, and work it out, and he will in probability admit he was wrong.

Instead it got out of hand and at the end a random woman threatened to stab me.  I was unfortunately not recording it at the time and am unable to press charges.

I just got an email from the (now ex) friend telling me to stay away from all of her(our mutual) friends.  She will be telling them I am a sexist in order to get them to stay away from me.

""So, good luck reconnecting with people here. Once they know your true feelings about women, I doubt that they'll want to associate with you.""

That is a direct quote.  I was quite careful not to say anything sexist in our conversation so there is no doubt she will be lying about me to them.  And this is after I had told her not to contact me because I didn't feel safe in her presence(she belittled the aggravated assault I suffered).

>The problem here is that nothing in this list is a result of feminism, at least not conclusively.
Not to mention it is cherry picked statistics; Essentially you've created MRA BS, much in the same vein as the shit feminists BS.
And it does nobody no favors to lump the entire feminism movement together in one large clump, because the overwhelming majority are just as rational as you want your fellow MRA's to be.

That's right. Incontrovertible statistics that nobody contests, not even feminists, are magically cherry picked.

Let me explain something to people not from this subreddit. [NAFALT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQWoNhrY_fM) is [not](http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/not-all-feminists-are-like-that-3/) a cogent defense. An institution and ideology in which patriarchy theory is the base dogma, a theory that unequivocally holds that, in blanket terms, men rule over women and are thus a problem, cannot be rational, much less have the overwhelming majority of it's adherents be rational, as MexicanGolf so unflinchingly states. Some who call themselves feminists may not believe in its base dogma and may be rational if not for the very fact they still, for whatever reason, decided to associate with an ideology that does.

Beyond this, the highest level of feminist activism (the ones who are essentially the face of the movement) have directly contributed to actual bogus research, a whole lot worse than cherry picking, like the [1 in 4](http://www.iwf.org/news/2432517/One-in-Four-Rape-myths-do-injustice-too) rape [myth](http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_campus_rape.html) while [completely erasing woman on man rapes](http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/ill-decide-if-you-were-raped-not-you/) which has directly negatively impacted men and boys, not to mention just peddling a whole narrative of man-bad woman-good that has led to everything from extreme bias against fathers in family courts and sentencing AND conviction disparities between men and women in criminal courts that makes the racial disparity seem trivial.

Yes, feminism has caused and/or exacerbated all of these.

Many of you tried to shamefully redefine language regarding the ""cherry picked statistics"" I mentioned earlier by saying ""yeah well men and women both have privilege so the infographic doesn't negate the concept.""

1373359014.0,The Zimmerman trial; a case of of presuming male hyper-agency?,"I've been watching the Zimmerman trial as of late, and that includes the discourse surrounding it.

The general tenor of the opinions break down into a few main points.  One of those is that Zimmerman should not have pursued Trayvon Martin.

This spirals into all manner of assertions in regards to Zimmerman's culpability.  I've seen it mentioned by professional news anchors that Zimmerman should have been aware that the damage he was sustaining while having his head beaten against concrete was insufficient to warrant unholstering his gun.

I have recently juxtaposed this in my mind regarding female culpability regarding rape.

For instance.. 

Zimmerman should have known better than to....  

Is perfectly acceptable.

She should not have worn...  gone down that alley... toyed with his emotions....

Is unacceptable.

Is this case a spotlight into the Hyper agency issue experienced by men?

1583468639.0,Feminist Letter To This Subreddit In General,"Dear Everyone,

I know some of you are alienating feminists, and, to be fair, there are many crazier feminists that are not for equality, but you all need to understand this.  Most women just want things to be equal.  And fair.  And that is feminism, which is not the belief that women > men.  Men = Women.  I feel like most readers need to try to get this.  Do women have the same legal rights?  Yes.  Do they have the same practical rights?  Are they treated equally?  Is there systematic oppression?  Well, those aren't quantitative.  And, if you look at it, the answer to these three questions isn't necessarily yes.

Women, for example, are more likely to get raped by men, but, at the same time, most of these rapes don't get reported.  It is partially their fault, at least, not reporting it is, but it makes you wonder *why* they don't report it.  Don't just stop when you have a fact - think about the why aspect.

The wage gap doesn't exist due to the fact that men work 56% of the time while women work 44% of the time.  Okay.  That's true.  But, *why?*  Could it be that a good part of women are expected to also clean and do housework and chores more often?  How much of that accounts for the difference?

Also, I want to say something.  I'm really sorry for bothering you all, but most feminists agree that social expectations of both men and women are unrealistic double-standards.  It shouldn't be like this where men are expected to be different.  You all can show emotion if you want to.  I promise most of us won't judge and might even try to help you.  You can wear makeup.  Though, if you don't know much about it, just ask my brother.  He'll help you all out.

Feminism is, and should always be, the belief that women should be equal to men, even if it doesn't benefit women.

\-- Penny

TL;DR - I'm sorry for bugging you all, but I feel like some things are not stated here.  And, women and feminists do care about you all.

EDIT: Hey guys gtg see you all soon.  And I will disagree and rebut tomorrow too.

Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all week.

EDIT #2: I have been informed that part of my post above was incorrect.  However, instead of going up and correcting this, I'm going to hope you guys read the edits.  Men are apparently raped about the same amount as women are.  I'm sorry, I didn't know before, and I will take this point into my worldviews.

EDIT #3: I'm sorry if I don't respond quickly to some of the longer posts, I'm trying to post between short tasks when I have time.  I'll respond more tomorrow.

EDIT #4:  My goodness I've been getting a lot of replies.  And most people are right.  I shouldnt've equated women to feminists.  I should point out that there is toxic femininity as well as masculinity.  Also, I said ""equal and fair,"" up above, where I should've stated ""equally until I know the individual and their traits.""

EDIT #5:  I really think that everyone should get my favorite mode of Basic Human Decency until I get to know them and can curtail that model to fit individuals.

I will try to be polite and courteous to anyone, regardless of sex, gender, race, sexuality, romanticity, pretty much most things like this.

1581865857.0,MensRights should not be Anti-Feminist,"I know this is going to get down-voted to hell, but I wanted to share. 

I am a feminist and I am for men’s rights. 

Feminism is the belief that men and women are equal, and both deserve rights. Feminism is against gender stereotypes (only women can be raped, men are the ones who provide for the family, women don’t have the same intelligence and strength, etc). Feminism is not against men’s rights.

Feminism is NOT the belief that women are superior to men. There are some “feminists” who believe this, but they are not true feminists.

If women treat men with respect and men treat women with respect, the world will be a better place for all of us.

It’s possible to be for men’s rights and women’s rights.

When you say you’re anti-feminist, keep this in mind. To be anti-feminist is to be against equal rights.

This post is related to men’s rights because the anti-feminism is preventing the subreddit from having women’s support. With women’s support, the sub will have more authority.

Edit: I reckognise that some “feminism” has hurt men. I do not support this, and it is not true feminism. 

The last paragraph I wrote was arrogant and I did not explain myself clearly. 

When women and men unite for equal rights, they will have more power. We are stronger united.

Edit2:  I’ve replied to most comments but now it seems pointless to me.

Some people have explained their opinions, given counter arguments, or started really interesting conversations. I actually appreciate this and have learned more about the struggles men have. It’s been educational and interesting. My opinion hasn’t completely changed but I now understand the world better. Thank you for this.

1383816991.0,"What's With This Subreddit? - A Meta Discussion About Passive Aggressiveness, Bitter Sarcasm, and a Lack of Action","First off, this is an alternate account of mine, and I would like to clarify that its age is not indicative of the time I've spent lurking/posting here, so please attempt to refrain from judging me due to a perceived lack of context. I can't give an exact date on when I first started coming here, but I know it has been at least a few years, so I think I have a rather nice frame of reference for what I'm hoping will be discussed.

I have long considered myself to be a feminist. My parents were divorced, my grandmother never married, and my mother was an only child. I had no father figure(aside from the occasional weekend visits with my dad), I had no grandfather, and I had no uncles. I have one sibling who is female, so I've never even had a brother. Basically, I have been raised by women and have been around them throughout my entire life. The majority of my family is female, with great aunts and cousins who are either single mothers or have outlived their husbands. Because of this, I think, I grew up with a great respect for women, and always considered them to be innately deserved of said respect. I had always heard thoughts and opinions filtered through the female mind, and had such things as chivalry instilled upon me at a very young age. I genuinely believed that women had been and always will be oppressed at the hands of men, and I set out at a very young age to bring balance to an unjust world.

I've always had very little in terms of a male identity. I attribute this to a lack of male role models in my life, and there were always things about manhood that I either never understood or had to learn on my own. From circumcision to masturbation to shaving to hygiene, everything that made me unique from your typical girl was always filtered through the perspective of women. Circumcision was never even discussed, and I had no idea it had happened to me until my late teens. Masturbation was evil and immoral, and I should be ashamed of doing it. Shaving my face was something I had to learn on my own. Pretty much every aspect of maleness came from a woman's opinion on what it was or what it meant, and I often find myself still confused about manhood and what it's supposed to mean.

When I found this subreddit, it was a breath of fresh air for me. I had never seen or experienced a ""male space"" before, and I attributed this to the fact that men did not need special spaces. That we did not need to talk about ourselves and our problems; that we did not have any problems worth discussing. My perspective had always been that women were the ones with struggles and hardships and obstacles to overcome; that they needed to band to together for strength and support because their lives were that much harder for them and to think that a man's struggle in life could be compared to theirs was absurd. But I learned rather quickly that this was not the case, and that I had actually been lied to about a lot of things, not necessarily from the women in my personal life, but by the books and websites that I had always turned to for a better understanding of women as a people.

Because of this perceived betrayal, I admit that I am bitter and resentful myself a lot of the time. I feel this way in particular toward circumcision, and I have oft-attributed the blame to ""feminists"" or ""mothers"" who do not care for me as a man. I see hypocrisy and double standards, and I become enraged and upset. I understand the resentment that I see from many of you, and I think that's why it breaks my heart so much to see it.

This subreddit has become increasingly caustic over the years, and I can understand why. You are labelled a bigot for voicing your opinion. Matters that are of serious concern for you are often brushed aside for something far more ""pressing"". You are scolded and shamed and harassed for daring to disagree with the majority. But the majority of the comments that I see here anymore are not from reasonable people. They are from broken souls who have been shattered by the realities of this world, and instead of attempting to fix themselves, they choose to lash out and play the blame game on other individuals.

Take a long hard look at the ""discussion"" you see going on here. We have turned into a circlejerk no different than SRS or feminism or even TwoXChromsomes (may she RIP). We vilify those who vilify us in the same manner and with the same justifications, and it is starting to become a problem. I feel sad and offended whenever I see someone use MRA as an epithet (the negative kind), but look at what we have done with the word ""feminist."" Our language and our conduct is no different, but because we feel as though we are sitting on the proper side of the fence, we don't question ourselves when we do this. I feel sad and offended whenever I see someone use MRA as an epithet (the negative kind), because I know that the person doing such has a point.

A cursory glance at this subreddit yields almost nothing but mordant, biting sarcasm and passive aggressive behavior that only further hammers home this us-vs-them mentality that is far too abundant in almost every subreddit you come across. These are the comments that get upvoted the most, and these are the comments that gain the most visibility. So can you really blame a man or woman who comes here, self-identifying as a feminist, and then gets offended and upset at what they see? Think for a moment of how you feel when someone uses MRA as a slur against you. When they call you an MRApist, do you not feel sick yourself? Now flip the script and imagine being called a feminazi when you self-identify with feminism.

This needs to stop, or at least I think it does. We were on the right track when our changed our tagline from *Earning scorn from bigoted feminists and white knights since March 2008* to *Advocating the social and legal equality of men and boys since 2008"", but it's quite clear we have been slipping since then. I don't want to tell you what to do, because you are all people with your own free will, but I think if you sit back and take a look at the current state of this subreddit, you'll find that it's honestly no different from these ""feminist"" havens people are always bitterly remarking about.

I think many of you will agree with me on this, and I have seen some noted changes over the past few weeks. There has been a significant reduction in Facebook screencaps and YouTube comments and other things that, frankly, don't really belong here. I myself have justified this type of content by saying it spurs conversation, but it really doesn't. It just encourages more sarcasm and more passive aggressive language that is detrimental to actually making a difference.

My personal suggestion, aside from the obvious of cutting the crap with thinly-veiled hostility, is to accompany every article posted about some injustice with a suggestion on how it can be corrected. I think instead of bemoaning the fact that bad things are happening, we should look toward solutions that can either correct the situation or prevent it from happening again in the future. I get e-mails all the time from change.org with a dozen different petitions on women's issues and what has changed because of them. Why not do something similar for a lot of the stuff getting posted here? Write in to news stations or senators or governors or plan a protest or something - anything, really. Stop focusing on the feminist organizations and the special interest groups and being bitter about the fact they don't seek to correct these wrongs. Instead, focus on what *you*, either as a group or an individual, can *do* about the stuff happening.

We can make a difference. I know we can. But we first need to break this ugly habit of passive aggressive behavior. We need to knock it off with the sarcasm. And above all else, we need to actually do something about the things that are affecting us. I know the majority of you are good people, and I know it can be hard to quell the anger that boils up inside of you when you read about a particularly egregious incident here, but you aren't helping anyone unless you take that anger and put it toward corrective action. Put it toward better yourself as a person. Put it toward defending yourself from something similar happening to you. Put it to something good.",MensRights

Systemically and socially women were living in the golden age, whereas men on average were suffering a sharp decline in all aspects of life from education to just staying alive. I think we were at the very brink of highlighting those important and serious issues to become more mainstream and yet coincidentally the craziest thing happened. Women in several states in the US were no longer able to access abortion and seeing that we're living in a gynocentric society in which feministic ideals were deeply ingrained in everyone so the natural conclusion that people took from that event was that we're living in a patriarchy that oppresses women, men are privileged, women don't have any bodily autonomy, and so on... The feminism that was already conditioned into everyone seemed to mutate after that and became all the more powerful giving no chance for men's issues to rise back up.

First, why am I posting on this subreddit? Because /r/anarchism has no real interest in Anarchism and all they want to do is ""rebel"" like angsty teenager against the ""oppressive whites and males"". I think true Anarchists got over the ideas of races and sex being barriers from people to become self-sufficient individuals but no, they still have to fight battles that have been fought decades ago.

Someone went as far as saying that *Feminism parallels anarchism very directly, although its critique of power focuses on the patriarchy, rather than the state*. 
Then, let's get back to the subreddit as a whole. They have a star system for differents kinds of Anarchism; pink-black for ""anarcho-feminism"" and purple-black for ""queer anarchism"", but no stars for ""anarcho-masculinism"". Because it makes sense, right?
And every time I questioned /r/Anarchism one-sidedness, I got answers like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/dbpnk/people_who_said_nigger_today/c0z2nd3?context=3) or [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/dbpnk/people_who_said_nigger_today/c0z2ufq?context=3). 
The people at /r/anarchism have never taken the philosophy they're pretending to champion seriously and I just wanted to warn other males that care about the issues of their peers that /r/anarchism is extremely misandrist and that they do not represent the opinion of all anarchists, just an unimportant part of privileged people that pretend to be anarchists because they have no idea of real social or racial struggle and only experience it through sit-coms.

Look how I get treated. Everyone in here is as bad as all those shitty feminists.

----------------------------------

So everyone is aware of the opinion that is popular among feminists that MRA is inherently bad and wrong. Because feminism is so mainstream and politically powerful, this idea spreads to people who are not necessarily into gender issues and, most regrettably, those who are just beginning to become interested in gender issues.

So I suggest we use their negativity against them. I, for one, will immediately cease calling feminism ""feminism,"" and shall henceforth refer to it only as ""WRA."" In this way, we more effectively call attention to the parallels between the two movements, lessen the effect of illegitimate criticisms of MRA by forcing people to associate the criticism with WRA as well, and making it more likely for people to recognize that legitimate criticisms of MRA are very often also legitimate criticisms of WRA.

Bonus: In addition, we also remind MRAs that feminism has its place. We don't want MRAs telling people that MRA is inherently good and feminism is inherently bad. That reflects poorly on all of us.

(Probably done by those who ""cry wolf"", but please pay attention)","I have noticed some problems within the Mens Rights community and this is my attempt at a redress for many problems I have found. This message may become manifesto-like, excuse that, but what I deliver is only beneficial to the movement.  

-[Liberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) is good and for some reason it has been accepted by some Mens Rights members that it is bad. Compare [Liberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) against [Conservatism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism). This is not an argument for socialism/capitalism; arguing an economic model shows ignorance and results in mistrust of Mens Rights; which is rooted in a SOCIAL movement.  

-Mens Rights is not a legal or legislative(as of yet) movement. It is a social/cultural movement; not a movement based on economic models, like socialism/capitalism/communism. (I am a liberal and believe in the benefits of a socialist/capitalist government, neither of which are social relations or representation; or a representation of the Mens Rights movement.)  

-Mens Rights must address issues with facts, and must support those facts with citations to be considered valid. Those who ignore the facts are unreasonable and must be ignored; do not cherry-pick your facts to represent your concepts. Cherry-picking stats/figures/facts is an insult to our movement and only lends to the movements ability to be discredited.  

-Invite everyone. Accept everyone who is willing to stand with you for equal rights across all genders/sexes/races/sexual-orientations(all human conditions). Accepting all, gives credence to our movement; We want you and we believe in your ability to stand for those who, for whatever reason, can't/won't stand for equality.  

-Mens Rights exist because no one will speak for men. It is a biological imperative that women must be protected, this is true for all mammals and a large part of reptiles. We and our opposition must acknowledge(through observation) that we are animals FIRST and humans as a second; the amount of data supporting this claim is overwhelming.(calling /r/unidan on this one.)  

-The human condition is not the same for every person. Consider that every moment in your life is a variable that shapes your outlook/reasoning of how society functions and how to interact with said conditions; now consider that for every person you meet. You are not alone, but you are in your experiences. This is irrational and it is the very nature of the human condition. We want to understand, but understanding begins within. (I know this may sound hokey or rooted in mysticism, but leave out the supernatural and attempt to understand why you respond to certain stimuli for deeper understanding of your peers reactions/responses.)  

-Do not believe that you are correct. Accept that your data can be wrong. If the opposition of your stance can present irrefutable evidence of their reasoning, you must accept it to be considered a respectable presenter of information. Know your point and argue it without distraction while providing citations.  

-Develop a relationship with your local congressman to discuss your ideas of what is morally sound or unsound. You are a participant in society and you shape society by your existence, you must use that to your advantage to shape the life you desire or to enhance the next generation of humans. 

I believe these stances I have listed should guide the Mens Rights movement to success in our goals of true equality. ",MensRights

According to this study, self-identifying feminists were found to be less hostile toward men than were self-identifying nonfeminist.

**And so here is my question to Men's Rights:**

In what way do feminist ideologies have a negative impact on men's rights/stereotypes of men, and at what point is the feminist ideology, when practiced, most harmful (i.e. at an individual level, at a group level, at a national level)? Do you identify the problem as one of hostility (i.e. how relevant is this study), or do you believe the problem is something else (e.g. neglecting the cultural constructions of masculinity, the sensationalized, media depictions of the feminist movement in either positive/negative regard, the historical context of the feminist movement, etc.) 

After identifying these three points, what is, in your opinion is the best approach to addressing the harmful gender inequalities that arise from feminist ideology/practice.

1538242540.0,I've had enough,"I lurk here regularly ever since I saw *The Red Pill* by Cassie Jaye. I have to say overall I agree with the Mens' Rights Movement.

But I've seen enough crap here, too, that I think you all need to take a second look at.

First, it is a false equivalence to compare FGM to circumcision. FGM removes a woman's ability to enjoy sex completely *as well as the possibility of other medical issues*. 

Circumcision is not that. There is the threat of possible medical issues from circumcision. I wish I had not had my son circumcised, honestly, because I didn't know the history or procedure at the time. 

But to tell people who earnestly believe that this is an important part of their lives (e.g. Jews) that this is a hill for the MRM to die on is to disinvite them. Allowing for the possibility that there are legitimate cases for it. Since it is not the removal of sexual pleasure it is up to the people, i.e. the parents and the individual. 

Second, a man accused of sexual assault should not immediately be defended. Nor should he be discarded. And just because a case comes up in the midst of a toxic moment (#metoo) doesn't mean that it is part of it. I am in a relationship with a woman who was attacked, abused, and ignored throughout most of her life whether by babysitters, boyfriends, or bosses. And not all of them were men, either! And she has never tried to do anything legally against any of them. But I can tell you that if any of them were running for public office she would be certain to bring it up. She's not holding onto it to wait for her moment of prime revenge. At this point, though she deals with the trauma of it to this day, the fear of reprisal and ""being put on blast"" keeps her quiet. All I can do is put her at ease and encourage her when the time is right. It takes gentleness, especially so that I'm not seeming like I forcing her to act on the fact that she was forced upon. It takes patience and gentleness that is admittedly difficult.

The point is that if you really want people to see that you are standing up for equal rights between men and women you need to take *each* case on its *own* merit. You can't lump them together. Whether they are accusing Kavanaugh, Weinstein, you, or me they need to be given the chance to be right. 

This, to me, is an important part of equal rights. Every person who has a grievance against another has the chance to be right. Every person against whom a grievance is brought has a chance to be right. I think [this image](https://i.redd.it/k5ym4rszu1p11.jpg) from r/libertarian sums it up pretty well. The only change I would make is to have the don't-believe side also shouting with the guy looking at both with the same face. Innocent until proven guilty. That means that the accused is to be given a proper chance to defend themselves. It also means that a proper investigation should be given to every reasonable accusation. 

With that in mind, I have seen **no one** on here actually addressing the concerns of Dr. Blasey Ford and her testimony, merely coming to the defense of Kavanaugh. While I honestly haven't watched the whole hearing, the portions I have seen show her to be a forthright and generally honest woman and highly intelligent. Meanwhile Kavanaugh's interviews and testimony are enough to say that I don't trust him at all. He wavered on his high school drinking *while having documentation showing that he was a member of ""100 Kegs or Bust."" The (extended) portions of his testimony that I have seen show that he was trying to operate on a script and when pressed for something more he stammered and repeated himself in a way that was honestly embarrassing. And then he had the gall to get angry about it! 

Third, and probably most importantly, the MRM is supposed to be non-partisan. I despise anything blatantly partisan and most of the posts I've seen here are nearly explicitly partisan. I cannot be a liberal: I think there is too much anarchy in it. I cannot be conservative: I think there is too much constraint in it. I sure as hell can't be a party member of anything except, maybe, the Pirate Party, but they aren't in my area. If the MRM is going to show itself to be what it claims to be it needs to back off of those terms. Do not support anyone, anywhere, ""because they are my party."" Instead support whomever you will, wherever you are, ""because I agree with them,"" or, more likely if you are honest, ""because I agree with them more than I do with their opponent, though I reserve the right to rescind my support.""

I want more than anything an end to both feminism and the MRM because they are no longer needed. But as long as you are drawing lines that are unwavering you will never win the hearts of your opponents. Only if you win their hearts will you see real change. That has been how feminism and gay rights and civil rights and other such movements of the past decades have been successful - not with gnashing of teeth but gentleness of heart.

So I ask you to stand up and do work like a man: The hardest work of all is to keep *yourself* in check. Fight *yourself*, fight your *assumptions*, fight your *biases*, and fight your *easy answers*. None of them help. No law is going to do it for you. No partnership of women is going to put you right. *Show* the world that you are *serious* about *equal* rights and, in time, they will join you. 

If we as men can show the rest of the world what masculine dignity looks like, that the privileges that we may enjoy (some are legitimate) come with weightier responsibility that we are keeping off the shoulders of the rest, then we may yet win what most of us truly want: simple equality. Equal sentences for equal crimes. Equal rights in all realms. Equal pay for equal work. Equal risk for equal reward. ",MensRights

Generally the answer was that they thought of feminism as the same as humanism, and in my opinion, were not really interested in complete equality.

While much of the media and people in general believe that MRAs just want a return to a state where women do not have rights, we here all know this not to be the truth. I've noticed that we have a harder time in general being taken seriously in discussions, interviews and our portrayal by the media is overwhelmingly negative, despite my own impression that we are merely fighting for a state in which men will have rights and opportunities equal to women. (e.g. parenting, the draft, workforce, education, etc etc)

So in essence what I am asking is why do we call ourselves MRAs instead of Human Rights Activists? I think we have no difference in ideology. I, as a men's rights activist simply act on my belief that all humans are equal, men and women. I only bemoan the antics of feminists when it's clear that they are not acting in as if women are not equal to men, but somehow purer, simpler, more qualified and educated by virtue of existence. There are places in the world where ""feminists"" do real good humanitarian work, and I do not begrudge them that. 

When I do humanitarian work, such as donating money to overseas organizations to fund schooling for underprivileged boys I am considered a humanitarian, but if I were to do the same thing here in the US, my work would be considered unnecessary and scorned for being pro-male, despite the fact that my interests lie in true equality between the sexes.

I'm not trying to be discouraging, I am an ardent proponent of men's rights. I've just been doing a little introspection lately, and was wondering what others might answer to this question? 

tl;dr - I think men and women deserve equal rights by virtue of being human, what makes me an MRA instead of a HRA?

(Quote) ""It's because of stupid people like Joe Rogan that fathers are treated as disposable in our society and laughed at for wanting to step in and take care of their kids or spend time with their kids. As if men only existed to work and nothing else. Fathers need to spend time when their newborn baby sons and daughters, with their older kids too, and children need to spend time with their dads, they need their dads, not just their moms. Also what about gay male couples who adopt a baby or have a biological baby from a surrogate? One of the dad is working while the other has paternity leave and then they switch. But Joe Rogan and others like him think that gay fathers shouldn't take a leave to take care of their baby sons and daughters. Fuck people like Joe Rogan. He has internalized misandry and throw people of his own gender under the bus. Taking paternity leave doesn't make you emasculated. It just means that you're a father that wants to see your newborn child. There is nothing wrong with that.

Conservative 4 minutes later: “Paternity leave is for wimps and fathers shouldn't have the same right to parental leave as mothers because I don't like gender equality, also men and fathers don't have to be in their children's live and spend time at home with them to take care of them, play with them and see them grow up. Men only exist to work and to pay child support if the parents are divorced and nothing else.""

Conservatives are pushing their fucking traditional ""gender roles"" (those idiots really believe that what you can and cannot do in life should be determined and dictated by what kind of genitals you have between your legs, it's so fucking stupid and bigoted really), their anti-equality bullshit, and their absurd belief that men who don't want to work all the time and want to see their children grow up are ""wimps"". Conservatism is cancer on society. Lets let Rogan, a rich multi-millionaire whose only job it is to talk into a microphone for a couple hours a day, tell people with real jobs they don't need paternity leave.

1318481572.0,"Seriously MRAs, what is with all this trans girl hatred? If you met some of the hot trans girls I've met, you wouldn't care what they were born with. And you wouldn't be gay for it, either.","Look, I've been a huge MRA for a long while now. I'm totally down with a lot of the core concepts behind the MRA movement, especially with the disconnects between male victims of domestic violence vs that of females, the disclosure of names of males on nothing more than the accusation of rape (treating them as though they're already guilty), and even the huge disparity and advantage offered to females in cases of child support and otherwise (I despise that shit with a passion - I've been through it myself with my 10 year old daughter).

But one thing I simply fail to understand is why so many of you are so damn insecure when it comes to trans girls.

Look, I get it, some of you want to start families - great! Find a girl who is fertile. I get it, some of you want a gorgeous girl to f@#k - great! Find a hot girl who wants you in her. And yeah, I get it, some of you think some trans girls are ugly as hell - great! Find a girl who you think is beautiful and date her. If the girl you pick happens to be trans, well, you're the one that thought she was attractive enough to date to begin with. What's the problem, again?

But this bullshit, and it truly is bullshit, that trans girls are not ""real"" girls, LOL. You have *not* met some of the absolutely gorgeous trans girls I've met. Even being a trans girl myself, running into a few of these girls makes me *wish* I really was a guy, because I can guarantee you, without a shadow of doubt, that if I had ran into some of these girls, who are trans mind you, while I was full blown out a guy, I would have loved f@#king some of these girls until the early morning hours. And I still would not be gay, feel gay, or be called gay. I'd be going back for more - a *lot* more! Relationship, sex, everything. Because trans girls *are total girls*!

I know what it is. You just don't want to be gay, and you especially don't want your friends maybe thinking you're a ""faggot."" You don't want your dick touching another dick, and you especially don't want to be looking at one while aroused. You're not a member of the queer community nor ever want to be associated with that stuff. Hey, cool! Neither did I when I was a guy. AT ALL. I was the straightest as straight could be, and the thought of a guy sexually was absolutely disgusting to me too.

But you know what you're all forgetting? You truly have *NO* idea how absolutely powerful hormone therapy is. You truly have *NO* idea what the transition process can do for a person. You truly have *NO* idea of the smoking hot trans girls I've met (some of them here on reddit, even). If some of you even did the most basic amount of research you may just have your mind blown so far about what gender really is that you'd come out of it with a different point of view.

I just think some of you are too chicken shit to challenge your world view. You're operating on assumptions and proud of it. Some of you are no better than the radical feminists who come into arguments with a dead set mindset and refuse to change any opinion for the better, even when presented with overwhelming scientific evidence of being wrong.

""Straight male sexuality is a fragile thing, like a soap bubble. The mere possibility of mistakenly feeling a bit gay would cause an inordinate amount of distress and anguish, so they have to be coddled."" -eoz

I would place a pretty good wager that many of you who would feel absolutely repealed by the thought of sex with a post-op trans girl have never actually had sex with a post-op trans girl. I would place a pretty good wager that many of you simply have no concept of how amazing the MtF sexual reassignment surgery really is. And yes, I would place a pretty good wager that if many you found the *right* girl, you'd be showing her off to your friends and family and they would all want to be the ones f@#king her too, without so much as a hint of whenever or not she was born with male plumbing - because it wouldn't matter - f@#king her would be just too much fun!

I welcome you all to educate yourself before making opinions on things you have no understanding of. Because all this trans girl hatred is nothing more than a clear sign of sexual insecurity mixed with straight up ignorance. Gender is *SO* much more complicated than this b.s. black and white societal world view based upon two chromosomes.

Trans girls *are* girls. And if any of you ever have the chance to get with some of the hot ones I've met (not the ugly ones that, yeah, we all can easily tell apart), you'd be high fiving yourself all week long. And you will *not* be gay for liking it, either.

The linked song will pretty much get the whole episode's plot across succinctly enough.  

The song juxtaposes the heroine's desire to complement her groom, and the villain's desire to subjugate him; even though that (until the climax of the episode) everyone sees the latter as the former.  It even references one of feminism's battle cries for the last lyric in the reprise.  Watch the whole episode on Youtube to get a closer look.  

To see a wildly popular show aimed at girls, conceived and written by a woman, giving such a message to young girls today strikes me as nothing less than resounding vindication for our cause.

1649040646.0,Why do incels exist? My thoughts are below,"1. Society is over-sexualized.  This is mostly because corporations, musicians, directors have realized that an appeal to sex is the best way to sell literally any product.  As a result members of society are encouraged to believe that sex is the most important aspect of life.  Naturally, those that don't have sexual relations feel like they are missing out on the most important part of life. 
2. In reality incels are upset about the legitimate discrimination that men face.  But since opposing this discrimination openly basically ends up with you being cast out from society anyway they have no motivation to confront the legitimate discrimination they face in a reasonable way and feel they might as well just go after women.  
3. Dating apps.  In more natural social environments men's romantic success is dictated both by how well they are accepted by women as well as how well they are accepted by men.  As a result a man who feels socially and therefore romantically rejected is not only resentful of women but also somewhat of men.  On the other hand, dating apps put the sole responsibility for rejection in the opposite gender's hands.  To make matters worse the nature of dating apps is that decisions are made primarily on superficial characteristics so men feel that women themselves are superficial.  Finally, dating apps disproportionally show attractive profiles which raises both the expectations of men and women and results in fewer satisfied relationships and more incels.",MensRights
1541541017.0,I need men's rights because of games like Red Dead Redemption 2,"I need men's rights because even things that I like aren't immune to trivializing men's rights.

Right now, I'm enjoying a video game called Red Dead Redemption 2. There's a side story that involves a creepy hick in the middle of a swamp, who invites you into his shack and, if you follow him, knocks you out (you don't have to follow him; you can just walk away or shoot him). From there, it's blurred moments of him molesting you, to the point of hearing pants unzip and clothing being removed. It concludes with you waking up in the middle of nowhere, with the option of tracking him down and killing him. There's also random jokes at the local saloon about him raping your character.

So I need men's rights because our culture continues to normalize sexual assault against men while shaming us if we ever dare to normalize sexual assault against anyone else. And I'm not going to do that ""If your character was a woman"" statement that we use here so often, but you can use your imagination of how mainstream media would react to that.

1430086628.0,Debate: Feminism is not a hate movement,"I identify as a liberal/equity feminist/gender egalitarian/MRA (basically when it comes to describing what most people believe on gender issues, labels are dumb) and I have been in extensive debate with /u/davidbyron2 today. David insists that feminism is a hate movement/anti-male. I think this is an idea that some here will probably believe strongly and I am highly interested in discussing this issue properly.  
  
Although I recognize that feminism has many problems and that some of these are explicit/implicit hate, I think that this is largely isolated to a loud minority. I am completely open to having my view changed, and although I have investigated this issue some, I have not done so extensively.  
  
So to be clear, my argument is not that hatred/anti-male ideas don't exist in feminism, but that these ideas aren't representative of the movement as a whole, and so to refer it as a hate movement or anti-male while not wholly wrong, is inaccurate, a gross generalization, and an absurd thing to say.   
  
I wish I could start out countering some of the reasons why davidbyron2 and others believe this way, but I haven't ever heard a very compelling argument, so I don't currently have anything to counter. But I can say that the fastest ways I would be convinced would be to:  
- Demonstrate hate from multiple influential leaders and a sound argument as to why these are representative of feminism  
- Demonstrate how feminist activism has created policies that harm men, and that this is a consequence that the activists and policy makers were fully aware of (We can talk about the Duluth model and domestic violence issues if you wish, but be aware that it receives much criticism from much of feminism)  
- Demonstrate that hateful views are predominate across the majority of feminism's sub-movements  
  
Perhaps the thing that seems most compelling to me is the current handling of rape in colleges and how little backlash there is against this. I need to investigate this further, but my current understanding is that some nutters ended up with too much power, and feminism's Machiavellian tendencies meant that most aren't much interested in tackling it even if they disagree.

But feminism did not continue the lecture or schedule another rally when it became time for women to learn that sexism against men is wrong.

I recently read an article about the Men's Rights movement, and something caught my eye. Tom Martin, the man who sued the London School of Economics for sexism a while back, had this to say:

>""Since the pill, women have been told they can and should be having orgasms. And because they haven't been, they categorise that as men's fault. It's women's job to make themselves sexually happy, it's not a man's burden.""

Then, a couple of lines down,

>The psychologist Oliver James believes men are feeling ""sexually threatened"". Women are no longer reticent about sex or their expectations from a lover. Furthermore they are now more likely to evaluate a man's sexual performance in public and even deride men who ""aren't particularly imaginative or clever"" in bed, he argues.

This really hit home for me because it's what I've always thought, but I've never really put it into words. But it's true; women simply expect men to ""give"" them an orgasm and get upset when they don't ""get"" one. The fact of the matter is, the responsibility for women's orgasms lies with just that: the woman. I've been with women who could orgasm several times during one session of sex, and I've been with women who, after 15-20 minutes of intercourse, still hadn't orgasmed, and were upset with me afterward, even to the point of asking me for oral after I had already given her intercourse for an extended period of time. This can only mean one thing: If my technique is the same and your response is different from someone else's, I'm not the one doing something wrong, *you're* the one doing something wrong.

I'm well aware of the fact that it's harder for women to orgasm than it is for men. That's why I put the effort in. I'm not a two-minute-man, I last a long time, my size is on the higher end of average. But only so many accomodations can be made.

1647152053.0,Men's Rights Should Not Be Right Wing,"I guess I'll alienate most of you both by how long this post is but also because I think we should stop with the feminism-hating and most importantly we should not position ourselves in the right. For full disclosure, I don't see myself as a feminist but I am on the far left. I may not agree with most of you on these issues but I'm arguing in good faith. Here it goes:

I want to preface this by saying I looked at a bunch of posts and comments here and I agree many of the issues being brought up deserve attention and are totally ignored by society at large. I think what's going on in Ukraine right now is outrageous and no one would accept it if the social group being singled out to stay and die was any group at all other than men. But even when it comes to smaller issues, I'm with you on many of them: circumcision when not medically necessary or done by personal choice should be absolutely forbidden, rape and domestic violence against men are not taken seriously by society, there is a bias favoring women over men in divorce courts, etc. And I agree that there needs to be some form of men's rights advocacy. People will sometimes tell you that because feminism is about the equality between the genders there's no need for a men's movement, but if we're being realistic, feminism isn't doing much to address these issues.

That being said, I think this movement does a HUGE disservice to itself by leaning right wing. I get it: you've seen all the crazy SJW and feminists compilations and they claim to be leftwing and they often antagonize men, and so you oppose that and you drift to the right. Also men used to be in a better position when it comes to gender relations so you lean conservative.

BUT, first of all I think it would be very helpful if the movement dropped the feminism hating. Understand that feminism is a gigantic range of movements and ideologies. It encompasses so much that one can hardly say they oppose it all. In fact, I bet none of us really understands it all. Be honest, how much feminist literature have you read? I don't mean singled out quotes cherry picked by people who already hold the same views you do. I mean how much of the decades of feminist theory have you read? The literature is endless and most of us never read any of it at all and even those of us who read a bit are far from having an extensive understanding. Remember that the examples of feminists going crazy and extreme that you know about have only reached you exactly because they are crazy and extreme. Those are cherry picked fringe cases that are not representative of feminism in general. You know when people mischaracterize the whole ""manosphere"" as people who want the state to redistribute women to men? Or a movement that indoctrinates mass shooters? It's the same thing. There are always fringe and crazy cases in every movement and those are the ones that people talk about because it causes controversy. If you never read feminist literature, just assume you don't know enough about it to take a position for or against it, and instead be for or against specific instances.

Understand that most people see feminism as a movement for women's rights and equality between the sexes (even if you think it's not). If you oppose this you'll alienate most of the people who would otherwise sympathize and care about our issues. That's totally misguided. A men's rights movements should be about securing men's rights and not about opposing some other movement, specially when that other movement is very popular and you'll drive people away by opposing it or reducing it to man hating or whatever. Instead, we should build bridges with the other social movements. Look at how feminism, the LGBT movement and even anti-racism movements often come together in mutual support and how effective that's been. We must learn from that. If we can get along with other movements, including the feminist movement, we stand to gain a lot more.

But more importantly, even if you disagree with me about feminism and other social justice movements, understand those don't define the left. A lot of it is liberal nonsense, which is not the same as leftism. The left or the radical left is primarily concerned with economics. We leftists want the overthrow of capitalism. And I know, many of you have been exposed to a lot of conservative pundits and think capitalism is fixing poverty everywhere and that trying something else by some law of the universe leads to gulags or whatever. I used to think like that too and that's a conversation we can have but that's besides my point here. I just want to stress that in no way does the advance of men's rights require deregulation or so called ""free"" markets or the destruction of public services or any of that right wing economics nonsense. You can be an advocate for men's rights and still oppose the exploitation of Man by Man. In fact, you should! Whatever infringements on the rights of men and of any human being, our economic system is the biggest culprit. Just because you oppose feminism you don't need to ""buy the whole package"" and position yourself on the right.  


TLDR: Men's rights activism is absolutely necessary. But also most of us don't really know much about feminism apart from some internet nonsense and constantly bashing feminism from a position of ignorance is both wrong and very unhelpful when it comes to getting people to care about our issues. And even if you stick to your anti-feminist position, that shouldn't make you reject leftism in general, as the greatest forms of oppression still come from capitalism and there's nothing in men's rights advocacy that requires defending a rotten, murderous, anti-democratic and exploitative economic system.",MensRights

We plan to start having children around three years from now; notably, we would like starting a family to be our decision, not forcibly by the government. Today, we would not immediately jump to abortion if we found out she was pregnant, but a few years ago we would have. Quick reminder that the laws passed in some states would ban abortion on a timeline faster than it can take to find out you are pregnant. 

Main point: The government you live in shouldn't be able to force you to have a child. Full stop. For a subreddit about rights, far too many people here are missing that bans on abortion are unjust and an oppression of human rights.

Millions of men each year will develop prostate cancer.  All of them will be oblivious to the silent killer growing inside them.  When symptoms appear, it will be too late for treatment.  This will cost them their lives, but it will also save lots of money.  There is no cheaper way to die than untreated prostate cancer.   Feminists will rejoice, because this will free up lots of money to pay for perks for women, like free birth control and yearly ""well woman visits"" (another privilege with no male counterpart, as ""well man visits"" do not exist).

In case you think ""family history"" will save you, think again.  Quoted from the USPSTF statement:

""This recommendation applies to men in the U.S. population that do not have symptoms that are highly suspicious for prostate cancer, regardless of age, race, or family history. ""

I get that. You guys did not like how the feminists were only concerned with the discrimination against their own gender. So isn't it hypocritical to go and form a counter group to combat the discrimination of your gender specifically just as feminists do?

Wouldn't it make sense to join ""Gender Equalism"" or something like that, where you want true gender equality and not disproportionate power to one gender or another? By trying to lend more power and voice to your marginalized gender, you are doing exactly what the feminists you despise are doing.

I really believe in a lot of the causes in Men's Rights, just as I believe in a lot of the causes of sex-positive Feminism. I wish both could stop being so myopic and entrenched in their own camp and come together to work towards legal and social Gender Equality.

Over the previous few days she'd stacked most of it in the wood shed, but now had a sore back and couldn't do any more. Without asking, I just started shifting it. She was very appreciative, but I actually kinda did it for me. As a soft urban white collar man who lives in a city apartment and has no need or even opportunity to exert myself with any work that requires strength or endurance, it just felt damn good to be doing something that men are naturally good at, and be appreciated for it, ya know?

I'm new to this sub, and am sure the topic has been covered a lot, but surely part of the reason for the 'crisis of masculinity' among male office worker types is that there's very little opportunity for them to do stuff women can't do \*(edit: as quickly or easily)\*. I'm willing to bet that men who do hard physical work like farming and construction don't have such feelings, and furthermore, that their female partners appreciate them more.

Same thing with scary situations. If there's a suspicious sound in the night, who goes downstairs to investigate? Not women. From a historical perspective, we live in much, MUCH safer environments that very rarely call for defensive violence. And so men don't get to feel like a protector either.

In nature, males are indispensable. Not just for procreation, but without them, females and offspring are at serious risk of being taken against their will or killed by rivals. Not a whole lot of that happening in urban settings these days!

**Men's responsibility:**

\- Providing financially to the wife and children and even to the sisters/mother if those aren't married. The woman's salary/inheritance is hers and she can do whatever she wants with it.

\- Provide accommodation to the wife/family.

\- Give a dowry to the woman to marry according to the husband's ability.

\- if a wife is divorced after consummating the marriage, she is entitled alimony which is paid for two years at least according to the husband's ability. He still has to take care of his own children until they become adults.

\- Have to satisfy the woman in bed.

\- Have to be kind/loving/respectful/forgiving/attentive husbands towards his wife.

\- Have to be well-groomed: smell nice and look well-groomed.  


\- In a divorce, the mother has more right to custody of her child than the father, whether it is a boy or a girl, so long as she does not re-marry and so long as she meets the conditions of custody. Daughters should remain with their mother until they get married. As for male kids, they should remain with their mother until they reach the age of puberty, and then shifted to their father in order to get acquainted with the traits of manhood.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Men's rights:**

1. The wife has to make herself available sexually to the husband unless there is a valid reason such as menstrual cycle, sickness and ritualistic fasting.
2. The husband has the right to chose where they live.
3. Wife should not admit anyone in their home whom the husband dislikes.
4. The man gets twice the inheritance the woman gets.
5. The man can divorce a woman without going to court. Divorce is extremely discouraged, but since woman are the one that initiate most divorces, woman need a court or the husband to agree to a divorce. For the court, these are valid reasons for divorce 1) Physical, mental, or emotional abuse 2) The man not pleasing her in bed 3) Failure of the husband to provide 3)  infidelity. 4) Failure to fulfill the objectives and purposes for which marriage was initiated. Such as incompatibility between the partners.
6. The wife has to obey her husband in things that are lawful in a marriage and are reasonable. For example, he cannot ask her to contribute to finances of the home since that's her right to be provided for.
7. The man can get a second wife with permission from the first and only if he knows he can be equitable (financially, emotionally etc). The number of wives was limited to 4, It was unlimited in the Arabian society before Islam and men took advantage of poor women etc. However, a woman can put in the contract of marriage from the beginning that she doesn't accept a second wife, which means the minute he gets a second wife they become divorced. The woman and man can put whatever they want in that contract. For example: It's common for young woman to put that they want to finish their education in city X and that husband cannot prevent that.
8. The man should avoid divorce as much as possible, however, if the differences are irreconcilable then divorce is permissible, but it should be done in a decent manner. The man can divorce the wife without going to court. ",MensRights

1653978538.0,I'm FWB with my ex who has a new man and feel blackpilled," 

I have to say that this experience has completely black pilled me and made me unable to trust. I'll provide some context.

I dated this woman for 7 years. We broke up because it just wasn't working anymore, no hard feelings. A month later she calls me trying to get back together, I tell her no. She was pleading to be at least friends with benefits so I caved in, and I booked a hotel for us.

We had sex, and afterwards we were sitting on the bed to watch some TV. Mind you at this point I no longer have romantic feelings for her. She is texting someone, I ask who and she says that it's her new boyfriend.

I was completely flabbergasted. I really thought that I knew her, and that she was a good girl, but here she is getting her back blown out when she has a new man. Admittedly, I shouldn't have done this, but I let curiosity get the best of me. When she went to shower I looked through her text messages and it made me feel sick to my stomach.

This guy has been basically worshipping her, telling her she's beautiful 1000 times and on top of that has been paying for her school, gas, and groceries. Mind you they've been dating for 1 and a half months. He sends these long paragraph texts to which she always replies with a few words. He had been trying to get in contact with her for hours, and what was her reasoning? That she was hanging out with friends and couldn't find an outlet to charge her phone. She even sent him a selfie snap right after I banged her, and he has no idea.

The fact that she was able to so nonchalantly lie to him like it was nothing sent shivers down my spine. Especially because I was with her for so long and never thought that she was this type of person. This has given me trust issues that I've never had before. To top it off, we had sex three more times throughout the night during which she complained that his dick isn't as big as mine.

I know it's not fair to base my feelings off one person, but this gives me major trust issues. You would think you know someone after 7 years, but she only just now revealed her true colors to me.

I know that I should tell the new boyfriend, and that it would be the moral thing to do. However, I'm single right now and I'm not going to pass up on commitment free sex, because she'll just end up giving it to someone else, so it might as well be me.",MensRights

If you want to read the post you can see it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/3g0x6x/feminism_isnt_the_problem_its_a_symptom_of_a/ (progressives have steadily been downvoting it, rather than arguing it, since it moved off the first page). 

Then I came across this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/3gkf09/why_do_the_elites_support_feminism/). I can't rationalise with this. It's actually calling the sky red and the grass purple. It's re-writing history for the purposes of confirmation bias, for fear they may have to face up to reality of their own political affiliation. When all feminist policy emanates from the left, particularly in the UK, when the entire debate is orientated around assigning rights to manufactured 'identities' rather than individuals, it's inconceivable that anyone would describe feminism as right-wing - it defies all popular consensus, it defies all objective reasoning and it defies basic observation. I expect the usual furore in the comment thread - the sky is red, the grass is purple, etc. - however, it's not reality. It's certainly not my reality - my reality is backed up by facts. 

What is evident, however, is that the majority of Men's Rights Activists are progressivism to the core. The same issues we experience with feminists we experience with progressives - the same shame narratives, the same exploitation of politically correct group think to make everyone in society conform to a narrow version of morality, the same 'class struggle' politics I, quite frankly, don't buy into (despite having been working class for the entirety of my childhood). 

While I will still champion men's rights, I will no longer participate in this subreddit or call myself a men's rights activist. I advise anyone who is opposed to progressivism to follow a similar tact, your liberal or individualist values (real liberalism, I might add) aren't welcome here, clearly (I was informed by certain progressives in that thread that individualism is the equivalent of being a 'selfish jerk', which pretty much says it all) - the problem, OUR problem, isn't just feminism, it's moral relativism, identity politics and the manufacturing of a 'guilt and shame culture/society', all of which are progressive to their core. 

It has become clear that participating in this particular group is merely adding fuel to the fire, particularly when the **moderators go out of their way to demonstrate their political affiliation by deriding my views as 'extreme' while not just sympathising with 'progressive' views, but pinning them to the top of the subreddit.**

I also appreciate this will be welcomed by the majority (and will likely be accompanied, progressive style, by a torrent of accusations, condescension and insults) - the reaction will be indicative of the political monopoly accrued by progressivism within the men's rights movement. The only reason I've posted this is to highlight to others what they are supporting.

You may even hear claims to the contrary - 'we are politically neutral' - however I encourage you to view the threads linked above to realise that's anything but the case. You may even hear, as you did in my other thread, that I'm merely a 'feminist infiltrator' trying to divide the community - if you believe this, then check my posting history. It's patently untrue and yet another shaming narrative and an attempt to attack me on identity, rather than points (which is, in essence, the proof of my points). 

This community is a fracture waiting to happen however rest assured: if you support this community, you support progressivism. ",MensRights

I say that im not that all up for the idea but i will give it a try as we get into the relationship. So here comes valentines day and she decided to dress up in a bunch of black leather and chains and she gives me this bracelet that is apparently suppose to mean that I am dominant. I am generally a pretty chill guy but fuck this is awesome. So im all in the mood and is sitting there playing with her self and telling me she wishes that I would fuck her. I told her that i didn't have a condom and she starts jacking me off.

""Dear men's rights activists.

I am a feminist and I want to understand your point of view. To me, feminism is about all gender issues. A problem such as my brother being discriminated against in his status as a single father is to me an issue that feminism fights against.

It seems to me that in fighting feminism, your whole movement is just fighting itself. Do you not see that statements implying lots of women lie about being raped stem from the same place as statements saying all men accused of rape are guilty?

It also seems to me the main point in a lot of the arguments here is that men are also subject to dehumanisation, and that therefore patriarchy and misogyny is bullshit. That's just plain illogical! All genders are subject to dehumanisation and the fact that men are, too, does not make it less true that women are. This is a fight we must fight together. Feminists are not your enemy. It's a shame to see thinking people fall prey to such logical fallacies. Just imagine the things we could do together.

1700531579.0,In Defence of the Marvels: I enjoyed it.," The way everyone went off on this movie I expected this to be a complete feminists shit show, but it wasn't political at all. The leads are all female, but there are some male characters, they aren't bumbling fools, useless, or the villain.

 There is Mrs. Marvel's Dad and Brother, who seem loving good men.

 Then there is Nick Furey who is alot more like his old self then he has in a long time.

 His second on command is a dude who seems reasonable capable.

 And minor spoiler but Captain Marvels husband is actually pretty freaking cool and good in a fight.

 I think this movie is paying the price for Brie Larson old man hating Captain Marvel interviews, for male Marvel characters getting sidelined by female characters in their own movies, etc...

 If this movie came out before Marvel and Hollywood spent the last 5 - 10 years or more emasculating man this movie would have made $400,000,000 at least. Instead it sounds like the dying screams of Marvel.

1454210142.0,"I love you guys, but I don't want to associate with the MRM anymore. Here's why.","So I've always been incredibly anti modern third wave feminism. I was attracted to the mrm since high school because as a Protestant Mexican American male I was told I had to act and think in a certain way, yet I saw the women of both my family and congregation do the exact opposite (basically pushing traditional gender roles on the men but expecting to be treated as strong, independent womyn). I also hated how hypocritical all the active feminist I knew and saw in the media were. I didn't see this in the mrm, so I jumped right in (and it has cost me some respect from peers).

Fast forward last year. I saw a Paul Joseph Watson video on modern feminism, loved it, subscribed. Then skeptorr, then karen. Then it went sour. It started with Paul Joseph, shitting on the Pope for his stance on immigration. As I watched his videos more I saw more racism, islamophobia, and just hate. Look into infowars, the i saw Alex jones. Never noped so quickly, unsubscribe from Paul joseph. Now I have been supporting Bernie Sanders and see a skeptorr video, not about feminism but about how trump isn't a bad guy, he's not racist, etc. Eww, but whatever, I never really watched his videos. Then I saw Karen defending trump  ( and cruz!) and I lost hope. Just like feminism is just the tip of sjw liberalism, it seems that the mrm has attracted ultra-conservative right wingers. I never had a problem with conservatives, but defending Trump showed me the mrm is becoming like feminism. The most vocal have some fucked up ideas. So I'm not becoming a feminist, never, but I am going to distance myself from the mrm. This sub tends to be full of ideas both conservative and liberal, good and bad. Please don't get me wrong, the movement is great, but the vocal minority are the ones who represent the movement, and I don't want to be associated with that.

Update: These comments have shown me that I am wrong to leave. Jumping ship will only make things worse. I definitely feel that I'm now, more than ever, in a position to be more active. If anything I'm going to start looking for ways that I can be more involved in the movement. Thanks guys.",MensRights
1444633354.0,Rant: What will the future look like if feminism wins.,"It has taken a while for me to write this, this is just a few things that I have noticed about what will happen if feminists ""win"".

I started this as a simple post about the future of society, and it has turned into more of a rant about some of the problems that are going to increase in the next several years.

Right now society is capable of funding ""feminists"" and carrying the weight of women who are not carrying their own weight. Right now men are still overproducing and generating extra income which is being eaten up by taxes (social programs), alimony, and child support. Men have started realizing that marriage is not the best option for them, so they are no co-habitating instead of getting married. They have less financial obligations, only taxes and child support if they break up.

Since women are graduating college and university at much higher rates than men, we are going to see a substantial change in the demographics, and economies of these western countries. Women will not be willing to ""man up"" and start working 45+ hours a week to finance all of the special programs and entitlements that many women live and rely on. Since men will not be attending, graduating, and working in these professions, they will be unable to pick up the slack, and companies will falter. Salary costs of running businesses will go up as they will need to hire additional women to do the same job, as these educated women will still want to have children, but as there will be fewer, and fewer upper echelon men they will be unwilling to marry lower caste men and will have to go to sperm banks to have their children. They could possibly lie and attempt to sperm-jack financially successful men but these men will not usually be interested in them because they will have access to many younger women, with less baggage.

Many men will be almost invisible to most women, trends are changing in the sexual marketplace. Reasonably attractive women are innundated with hundreds to thousands of matches on dating sites, and have their choices when it comes to hooking up on apps like tinder. Because of the larger amount of interest women artificially inflate their value, and subconsciously think that they are much more attractive than they really are. They might think that they are a 9-10 and deserve a guy like Brad Pitt, even though they are a 4-5. These women will still be mad if men find an alternative to women (sex-bots, prostitution, or pornography) as it will reduce the human capital that they will be able to take advantage of. Women are afraid that if men have a realistic alternative to sexual gratification then they will not be able to trick men into relationships. They will not be able to easily sexually manipulate mens emotions and desires, and finance their lives. 

As many men who did shoulder the responsibility of being a provider, these signals to more and more men are being shut off. Whereas they used to be able to get married, and have reliable access to sex from their wife, and had a partner who would shoulder some of the responsibilities so they could focus on work. These men would work, and work, and work, to ensure that their wife and children were well taken care of. Now these men who are good men are almost invisible to women. Fifty years ago men would be able to get married to great women who were lifelong partners, they understood that they had to make things work for both of them and their children to survive. Things changed heavily in the times after this, Ten to twenty years ago some men used to be able to get married to these very well used women in their early thirties looking for someone to take care of all their debt, their children from previous relationships, and finance their lifestyle. Now these men are starting to ignore these women as they do not want to pick up the shattered pieces of these womens past.

These men are being rejected by society in education, the workplace, and relationships. More and more are becoming disenfranchised about their place in society. They feel that they are worthless, and blame the people who reject them the most. This could be the reason that we are seeing increased amounts of mass-violence from troubled people. This is probably going to increase as society cares little for the well-being of men, especially those with mental illness. As a society we do not recognize mental illness, and usually we tell men to ""man up"" and internalize their pain and issues. Many of these people end up on the street, and are constantly victimized. 

Society needs and expects men to finance all of the entitlements that women need and require to artificially replace men. Once men are priced out of the market by being unable to access education, employment, and desire, men will not want to expend all the extra work required. Society will be unable to replace the taxes generated by these men. Women will not want to pay for all the lost taxes by men. We think that we have seen shaming men back to the plantation so far, we have seen nothing yet about how men are rejecting school, work, relationships, And women demanding that men get back to them.",MensRights

Let's talk statistics because race is NOT gender.","I have seen the most inane stories men upvoted on this forum but not a initiative to [help Black and Hispanic boys.](http://www.whitehouse.gov/my-brothers-keeper) 

The response from this sub is not only troubling, it's practically a deal breaker. Men's Rights ain't worth fighting for if it's to help those who want my people's needs to come last every single time just to make themselves feel better.   I will not be apart of a white men's rights sub. It's never expected or wanted a PC(politically correct) paradise. In fact I usually consider PC Orwellian authoritarian over reach. I'm not seeking a progressives paradise but at the least I hoped for solidarity among men could be taken for granted. Now I know I was wrong so I have to do what I'm usually doing with feminists.  Dropping stats and applying common sense. 

The cause of racial animus and resentment from whites towards minorities tends to be emotionally driven and irrational just as the hatred of men coming from feminists. The difference is there isn't much love between the races while the sexes are literally made for each other.  The key point is whites don't have a rational basis for fear minorities because these minorities are far more likely to occupy the bottom classes and are fewer in number. Whites on the other hand make up the wealthiest and most powerful 65% of the nations population.

Minorities have legitimate cause to fear whites because of the racial politics in this nation. We effectively have one white people party and one for the rest. [Political Party demographics](http://www.gallup.com/poll/160373/democrats-racially-diverse-republicans-mostly-white.aspx):
Republican: 89% White, 2% Black,  6% Hispanic,  1% Asian, 1% other.  
Democrats: 60% White, 22% Black,  13% Hispanic, 2% Asian, 1% other

[FYI Gender by party](http://www.gallup.com/poll/120839/women-likely-democrats-regardless-age.aspx):(Democrat 41% Women 32% Men / Republicans 25% Women ,  28% men) Remainder independents. 

What matters here is how someone seeking office is going to get elected by the demographic base of these parties. A office seeker who is Republican will almost always be concentrated on appealing to whites and since few minority votes are up for contention exploiting racial animus tends to get the job done. They will do things like attack welfare, affirmative action, push harsh mandatory minimums, go after the character of the poor(minority), or anything else to exploit the ever present fear and loathing certain whites have for racial minorities.  Right wing politics leans against minorities, while the left tends to be supportive of them. We aren't seeing a class line split here or even a major gender split.  This is primarily about race. 

So when we see a backlash or a dull thud for initiatives helping racial minorities here we should recognize that the right wing mentality and perspective is deeply racialized in a way the left is not. Unlike the right the left is extremely diverse.   Even over achieving ethnic groups such as Jews or Asians will flock to the left. When it comes to dealing with diversity the left will always do it better. The MRM needs to be more like the left even if people from it are on the right. The MRM needs minorities, men on the left,  the LGBTQ  because these people speak the language of social justice.  To disregard 60 years of social progress out of arrogance ideological commitment is bullshit.  The lefts human rights movements did something really good and we all know it, but one of those movements has gotten out of control.  That is our cause for solidarity not some rebuttal of social justice or the need to correct injustice in the society. What do you people think we are doing here?  Don't talk out of both sides of your mouth like some people.  We are not just anti feminists we are for men's actual legal, parental, civil, and human rights.   

 A white men's white rights movement is a bad joke I want no part of.  Straight up. After years of effort I will quit just like that and leave feminists unchecked because they at least pretend to care about minorities on good days. Being resented by the very white men you trying to defend is not going to work. I know some people are bitter about identity politics has portrayed the white men but you don't find the most disadvantaged people to take your frustrations out on. That's in my opinion is the cowardice of a bully seeking out the smallest person they can to make an example of.  

   
A minor effort to help black's and Hispanics is deemed ""discrimination"" as if there were some conspiracy of white oppression at work. The very idea of helping people whose claim to fame is being among the very the worst off groups in America is attacked as a threat to race relations.

As if the achievements of this 30.5% Black/Hispanic population:

How bad do people have to get beat up in this society before they get some compassion? These men claiming they are angry men don't get compassion then turn around and scorn men receiving it because they aren't in their race or they think it will make whites jealous.  How the hell are you going to be jealous of those on the bottom?

Seriously, this one tiny paragraph explains almost everything feminists are mad about in society. It also explains why there is opposition to gay marriage and why women are still viewed as weak. It's because women did take on the submissive, weaker roles for the majority of history and only strong men who could reproduce and create more strong men were of use to society.

Then I got pregnant again. My oldest was 6 yrs old, daughter was 4. When it came out that I was having a boy, my sisters and my mother demanded that I abort. They would say I have every right, because he has a defective chromosome. They would go on to say that the Y chromosome is missing something. I was shocked when my grandma made the defective Y chromosome remark, although she never suggested abortion. I was left crying much of the time. I folded under the pressure and ended the pregnancy. Meaning, I ended my son's life. I knew I did something terrible, and became horribly depressed and even tried to commit suicide. Then I went on and had two more boys, and withstood their pressure.  Then I did it again. I was 35 yrs old, and did it again! Later, I did have a baby girl at 41 yrs old. I barely see my mother or sisters now. I hate them almost as much as I hate myself. But on the girl, I did not tell anyone I was pregnant until weeks after I knew the gender. When my mom found out, thinking it was a boy, she went off on me. This is an educated woman who went to an Ivy League school. She really ripped in to me, so I turned off voicemail and did not take her calls, or my sisters'. Later, when she found out I was having a girl, she got very excited and even started sending gifts.

1668376401.0,PART 2 - CONSCRIPTION FOR MASS GENOCIDE? THE TRUTH OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR - GERMANY ISSUE,"&#x200B;

THE SCHLIEFFEN PLAN

Among the things that dont make sense about the folklore of the First World War is the famous 'Schlieffen Plan' - in short the plan to advance an invading German army quicker on Paris by detouring through Belgium. The other main part of this plan was starting large battles in the countryside, rather than advancing on the capital. German military strategy was not delegated in this way, but we know from officer accounts that there was some sort of secret plot, started by Alfred von Schlieffen. Germany would never have invaded Belgium otherwise, because as you just read, it was a military protectorate of the British Empire. The German generals knew that Great Britain would be pressed to declare war on any Belgium invader, so it's very strange for Wilhelm II, a self-declared 'friend of England', to approve bringing them into the war - especially when their interest was France.

&#x200B;

Look at it with the anti-revolutionary hypothesis though, and it makes perfect sense. Germany and Great Britain need an excuse to start a war with each other, so they can send their threatening demographics into the Killing Fields. The problem is that the rulers of Great Britain are on fairly good terms with Germany. In fact the Russian, British and German nobility have in 1913 been happily celebrating together the peace-making wedding of two common relatives. And Germany has no interest in fighting the British Empire anyway. Other than a naval rivalry, with improving diplomatic and personal relations between Great Britain and Germany's rulers, it's as hard as ever to start a war between them. The way to publicly force the issue: attack one of their protectorates, giving George V and the British command an excuse to send their soldiers to the continent. And this is what happens.

&#x200B;

Perhaps then, the 'Schlieffen Plan' is simply that; the plan to give Great Britain justification to join in this killing scheme.

&#x200B;

The plot seems to have its origins in around the year 1900. It started to become more resolute from 1905-06. Its not a far stretch to think that Schlieffen would be open to the genocide of rebels - he and Wilhelm II had done just that to the Herero and Nama in Africa from 1904 to 1908 to crush their uprising. Schlieffen said that they must 'annihilate' these people. It is considered the first genocide of the 20th century.

&#x200B;

Von Einem was also involved with much of the German military buildup to the outbreak of the War, and oversaw the building of artillery and machine guns with Ludendorff. Of course, Wilhelm II was the leader over all. If neccessary, he was ready to dissolve the Reichstag. To maintain his authority over Germany he tried to introduce what was known as the 'Prison Bill'. This legal option failed, so he appointed the radical Bernhard von Bulow as his Bismark, Chancellor and PM of Prussia. Wilhelm said ""As Bismarck and my father, we will clear away the filth"". 

&#x200B;

Bismarck himself reversed the progress of the 1848 socialist Revolution, which may be what Wilhelm was alluding to. Wilhelm and von Bulow endeavoured to fight against the growing rebellion and social democracy. They embarked on ""a fight against the overthrow by all means"". This research proposes that ""by all means"" includes sending the threatening demographic into the Western and Eastern Fronts.

&#x200B;

The main concern for the German elite and their most important plans seems then not to have been a threat from the rulers of France, nor of Russia, nor even of Great Britain. It was the threat from the proletariate in those countries and, most importantly, in their own. Schlieffen's plan would soon be given added impetus.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

SOCIAL DARWINISM AND MOLTKE

Schlieffen's plot was overtaken upon his retirement in 1906 by another madman called Moltke the Younger. Like many of the General Staff, Moltke was a Social Darwinist. This was a new extremist belief popular with the elite of the time, a pseudoscience that appropriated the general ideas of Darwinism to modern human society. In effect the poor were less worthy of survival than the rich, and it is the job of the powerful to kick out or crush the lower classes, as it is nature's way to eliminate the weak in the natural world. As logically flawed as that seems, it was popular among some military commanders of the First World War, and that included some of the worst mass-killing generals, such as Ludendorff and Falkenhayn. 

Alfred Ploetz, a promotor of Social Darwinism in Germany, suggested sending the country's 'undesirables' to the front lines of the First World War, so that they would be killed before those who were deemed to be more fit.

&#x200B;

The Social Darwinists also included Bismarck, who was Chancellor under Wilhelm II in his earlier reign, as well as under his father and his grandfather. Hearing a socialist speech by Bebel was, he said, a ray of light, showing him that socialism was an enemy to be fought against and crushed. In 1878 in support of the king he instituted a series of repressive laws criminalising socialist activities, the Anti-Socialist Laws. While he left Wilhelm's side and active politics in the early 1890s, his influence was significant and he may have conceptualised with his Social Darwinism the potential solution to the gathering issue of socialism in Germany. Social Darwinist propagators included the Alldeutscher Verband, which had enormous influence on the German government during the War. At this time they also mobilized members of the Bildungsbürgertum and the broader middle classes in the service of a class-based vision of Volksgemeinschaft, radicalising the right during the War. They campaigned for genocidal commander Hindenburg and his extremist partner Ludendorff from the Third Supreme Command, with whom he toured some of the worst battlefields, The Somme and Verdun, to form a dictatorship, and supported Ludendorff after it as well, in blaming socialists.

&#x200B;

Moltke was largely responsible for the execution of the Schlieffen Plan. The one who wanted war with both Great Britain and Russia received British and Russian honours. This contradiction is common among the worst killers of the War on all sides. He was Wilhelms aide-de-camp, and in his inner circle from at least 1891. He was also a friend of Wilhelm's. This explains his appointment as Chief of Staff after Schlieffen retired, which was controversial then, and remains so today. Moltke pushed for war with Britain as well as with Russia. With Wilhelm II he was a big part of the decision to go to war in the first place.

&#x200B;

Moltke was Chief of the General Staff from 1906. In 1914 he took command of all field armies. He then passed that command to Falkenhayn, a fellow Social Darwinist. At one point during the War, even Wilhelm himself apparently doubted a fight on the Front, but Moltke continued. In private, Moltke would sometimes admit that he doubted Germany's actual chances of winning a future war, yet he pushed obsessively for one, and outwardly presented that Germany would win.

&#x200B;

Moltke says before the War that war on the Western Front had been planned for a long time. That admittance is strange enough to be worth looking into by itself. Molkte repeatedly stated that 1914 would be the best time to start a 'preventative war'. A war preventing what, exactly? This research suspects that overthrow by public uprising was the target of prevention. Sure enough, Moltke mobilised the Germany Army. He actually did this before the War. By his own statements he was preparing for it from at least 1911.

&#x200B;

When he handed over command to Falkenhayn, he went to be the Cheif of the Home Substitutes - i.e. sending the reserves to the Front. This would seem to be a role that would enable him to put into force his belief system of and long-term plans for putting German men on the front line. It was Moltke that was in command of the Battle of The Marne, a point of convergence for many of the commanders who would go on to get so many of their men killed. He himself issued no orders at all to the 1st, the 2nd or the 3rd Armies from the 2nd to the 5th of September, despite being their commander. A common battle protocol in the German Army was 'Auftragstaktik' - subordinate officers could decide on actions on their initiative. For some reason there seems to have been none of this in The Marne, which led to a great many German deaths and casualties.

&#x200B;

When he died in 1916, Moltke left behind a pamphlet, ""Die 'Schuld' am Kriege"" (The Blame for The War), for his widow to publish. After she read it, she didn't, because of 'the problems it might cause'. Apparently even the German Army chiefs and the Foreign Ministry were disturbed by its contents, and General Wilhelm von Dommes, who was sent to advise Moltke's widow against publication, wrote in his diary that the pamphlet ""contains nasty stuff"". I know... I am as intrigued as you are, but Moltke's pamphlet has been kept secret ever since. Some of it was even destroyed during the Second World War, apparently without any copies or citations being made.

&#x200B;

Moltke, with Wilhelm II and their associates, had long planned sending Germany's men to war. One more assassination of the nobility, and they would put it into effect.

&#x200B;

RESULTS - WORST KILLERS OF OWN THEIR MEN + KILLER PROFILES

&#x200B;

We will now briefly look at the actions of these elites and the elites trusted army commanders. This section will include a few notes that, due to the deadline for publishing and the long time spent on research, could be written better. That research has though been fruitful, and recurring officers appear to be involved in many of the War's most shocking and bizarre causes of mass-casualty. The German commanders that got the most men under their command injured and killed, found from the method detailed above, were the following. The seven suspects with the most casualties under their command by battle involvement are listed first, along with a couple of authorities on the national level that they worked with.

&#x200B;

ERICH VON LUDENDORFF

The Nivelle Offensive (April-May 1917)

3rd Battle of Ypres (Passchendael) (July-November 1917)

The Spring Offensive - Kaiserschlacht (""Kaiser's Battle""), also known as the Ludendorff offensive (March-July 1918)

2nd Battle of The Marne (July-August 1918)

The Hundred Days Offensive (August-November 1918)

&#x200B;

A strong example of the number of casualties, wounded and dead (almost if not entirely male) of von Ludendorff's own side, and only his own side, from the battles he commanded or jointly commanded:

Erich Ludendorff. Number of German casualty involvements, not including PoWs: 163,000 + 139,000 + 217,000 to 400,000 + 688,341 + 785,733 (+12,500 Austro-Hungarians) = between 2,005,074 (lowest minimum estimate) - 2,118,074 (highest minimum estimate) men.

&#x200B;

Two things.

The first requires some reflection, and I suggest that the reader does that.

&#x200B;

The second is that you will notice that the order of home casualties with Ludendorffs involvement is: 163,000, 217,000 to 400,000, 688,341, 139,000, 798,233. If this is plotted on a graph, you will see that the average distribution shows an increase, rather than a decrease (which one would hope a commander would exhibit due to reducing losses from previous experience). There is no avoidance of casualties here - even if Ludendorff (and his commanders) considered these men as mere resources, surely he would have reduced their losses, rather than increased them.

&#x200B;

Notes, Ludendorff: (Ludendorff's is the longest note section)

\- considered a competent officer

\- considered immensely powerful behind the scenes (in fact noted as the most powerful person in Germany)

\- was the army commander who oversaw the development of the secret 'Schlieffen Plan', the goal of which seems to be to start large battles in the countryside instead of simply marching on Paris, and to bring Great Britain into the war by invading Belgium, which he knew was a British protectorate

\- Ludendorff and Bauer, whom the OHL under Ludendorff relied on for his political judgement, saw eye to eye: to them ""To govern means to dominate.""

\- he, with another general, von Einem, pushed for huge artillery (Krupp and Skod seige cannons) and machine guns - then both new technology - to be used in the war (artillery was the most common cause of death in the Trenches)

\- couldnt keep his promise as a general to stay out of Politics - was dedicated to political calls for more young men to be brought into the war

\- established with OHL a propaganda unit, and their lecturers were told to ""ensure that a fight is kept up against all agitators"" 

\- chose direct full frontal attacks instead of tactical movement

\- believed that conquered peoples should be expelled as they were 'incapable of producing real culture', and believed that officers are superior to civillians

\- in February 1917, it is as if Ludendorff and the French battle commander Nivelle (see France issue) knew eachothers plans to inflict maximum casualties, resulting in a French soldier mutiny

\- in Amiens, when the British introduced tanks, he refused to let his soldiers surrender

\- was appalled by the Left and German soldier mutinies

\- in 1918 munitions workers striked for peace. Ludendorff ordered all strikers fit to bear arms to the front line

\- ran a military dictatorship over Germany

\- started overseeing the economy, assigned his officers to government ministries, etc, so he knew what was going on and could press his demands on the country

\- his office (the OHL) managed food supplies, and did so unfairly. He allowed the food shortage crisis.

\- demanded economic concessions for the industrialists

\- when they started to be developed, his OHL would have been responsible for tanks. Krupp and Daimler designed a light tank which could have helped bring the end to trench warfare, but their production was not authorised. Therefor these first tanks couldnt be used until April 1919.

\- Hindenburg was his closest colleague, whom he got appointed and whom always acted on his advice. Hindenburg even made a personal plea to Wilhelm II to be reunited with Ludendorff as his deputy. 

\- together they toured two of the worst killing fields, Verdun and The Somme

\- for Operation Michael, his and the OHL's focus was on the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig - the worst, or one of the worst, mass killers of British men in the First World War

\- after the War, Ludendorff got no punishment from the British, nor the rest of the Entente. He was elected to the Reichstag from 1924-1928 as a politician for the far-right NSFB, and became joint-leader

\- in 1919, Ludendorff was living in a hotel in Berlin, and talked to his fellow resident Neill Malcolm, who was head of the British military mission (who also made no attempt to capture him)

\- Max Bauer and Crown Prince Wilhelm (Emperor Wilhelm II's son and heir) agreed that Germany needed a dictator, and their choice was Ludendorff. But he fled the country because he was so hated by the German people

\- tried and succeeded in bringing the USA into the war (with unrestricted submarine warfare)

\- his Pour la Merite medal was presented by Wilhelm II himself

&#x200B;

Other notes:

Ludendorff was close to Schlieffen, whos eponymous 'plan' he instigated, from when he joined the Great General Staff. From that time he was also close friends with artillery officer Max Bauer. Bauer studied how the German economy would function during a continental war. It was also Bauer who developed poisoned gas for the trenches, and was the one responsible for some of the artillery used there.

Ludendorff led under von Bulow in the 2nd Army, who again, is also in the same suspect group as Schleicher and Groener.

Ludendorff started using - presumably Max Bauers - poisoned gas shells in September 1917.

His wife said he had 'not a spark of humour'.

Ludendorff placed the food minister Michaelis as Chancellor of Germany, presumably either to control food distribution to Germans, and/or due to him not being a threat to his own dictatorial power.

A note about his Second Battle of the Marne: 'It was believed that the Allies had the complete picture of the German offensive in terms of intentions and capabilities. The Allies knew the key points of the German plan down to the minute.'

&#x200B;

\- LUDENDORFF -> HINDENBURG

As Hindenburg was in such a powerful position and so close to Ludendorff, we shall briefly take a few notes about him and his entourage:

Led in the Hundred Days Offensive, as did Groener, who is only excluded from this list of top suspects due to casualties under him not amounting to as many as those listed. 

After the war, Hindenburg and Schleicher blocked a German referendum expropriating the property of the nobility, which many leaders and generals themselves were in. 

Schleicher, in the same suspect category as Groener, gave an ultimatum to crush the peoples' Spartacus League rebels (international German-based proletarian revolutionaries). Schleicher and Groener then decided to crush democracy. Schleicher, Groener, and Hindenburg's son were the unofficial 'Kamarilla', a group politically advising the head of the German military, Hindenburg. In 1918 to 1919 during the German Revolution Groener worked with the new president Ebert to sabotage a left-wing takeover. 

Under Hindenburgs command, the army murderously surpressed popular uprisings throughout Germany.

Hindenburg commanded all troops on the Eastern Front. Gallwitz (see below) also led in battle under him.

Hindenburg, despite being one of the three most prominent leaders of Germany and the Central Powers in the First World War, got no punishment from the Allies. He resigned from the army of his own accord in 1919. In fact, he would later become Chancellor of Germany.

One of Hindenburgs new armies he named the 'Nieman Army'. This could be due to the name of a river, or it could be a hint that he considered his troops to be worthless nobodies (given that 'niemand' means 'nobody' in German). Given his official leadership of the other generals on this list though, there is already enough evidence of his dislike for the recruits under his command.

&#x200B;

CROWN PRINCE WILHELM (CPW)

Major Battles involved in, by German wounded and dead:

1st Battle of The Marne (September 1914) 256,000

The Battle of Verdun (expected: with Knobelsdorff) (February - December 1916) 379,000-400,000

The Nivelle Offensive (April - May 1917) 163,000

&#x200B;

\- family bloodline to George V and Nicholas II through his father Kaiser Wilhelm II

\- led men into a few of the worst battles of the War. Took control due to being the heir, and he was unqualified, but cannot use that excuse as he was assigned an experienced Chief of Staff, von Knobelsdorff

\- involved in the Ardennes and Verdun, especially operation Gericht. CPW led opposite Petain, French commander at Verdun. Petain died three days after CPW. 

\- was taught and supervised by Mackenzen (another suspect), at the request of his father Wilhelm II

\- head of Army Group German Crown Prince. Repeated officer suspects in his AG include Fritz von Below and von Einem, as well as Gallwitz. It was CPW who gave the 5th Army to von Lochow then Gallwitz and then von der Marwitz.

\- later went into politics - Der Stahlhelm - opposed to democracy

\- British, Russian and Belgian honours

\- Max Bauer became his trusted friend at 5th Army headquarters, who arranged the artillery support with him for Verdun

\- links personally to other prime suspects: Falkenhayn (F's brother was his tutor), Mackenzen (see above, and M's son was close with Wilhelm IIs son and CPW's brother, August Wilhelm), and Albrecht von Wurttemburg (lead alongside him in the battle of the Ardennes). Also with Kurt von Schleicher (friend).

\- his home was used by the Soviet Allies for the Potsdam Conference in 1945 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

GALLWITZ

Major Battles involved in, by German wounded and dead:

The Battle of The Somme (July-November 1916) 434,000-445,000

The Battle of Verdun (February-December 1916) 379,000-400,000

&#x200B;

\- led some of the worst battles of the First World War.

\- led the 5th Army, belonging to CPW. The men under Gallwitz and Fritz von Below largely bore the brunt of The Somme.

\- lead under Hindenburg in the 8th Army

\- lead under/alongside Mackenzen, and replaced him as commander of the 11th Army

\- 'ennobled' by Wilhelm II

\- led under Linsingen (see below) and over commander von Einem in the Gallwitz Group

\- was opposed to armistice even very late in the War. Instead wanted to issue a 'call to arms' to Germans

\- couldnt be appointed the successor to Hindenburg as Cheif of the General Staff, although considered for it, because he went into politics after the war. He was a politician for the DNVB, a member of the Reichstag from 1920-24 

\- like others here, he was never punished by the Triple Entente (which, as with other generals, might have stopped his son from also being a general in the Second World War)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

FALKENHAYN

Major Battles involved in, by German wounded and dead:

1st Battle of Ypres (October-November 1914) 80,000-130,000 (or 134,315 German casualties in Belgium and northern France, 15 October – 24 November)

The Battle of Verdun (February-December 1916) 379,000-400,000

The Romanian Campaign (August 1916-January 1917) 47,000+

&#x200B;

\- was a leader in the Boxer Rebellion in China years before the War. He was lead by the madman General Waldersee, and cooperated with leaders that included Nivelle

\- Nivelle was the French general who also sent his men to their deaths en masse, and he did so opposite Falkenhayn in Verdun. In other words, there is a connection between Falkenhayn and Nivelle - they were allies in China - and then opposite each other caused one of the most unnecessarily long and highest-casualty battles of the First World War.

\- personal connection: his brother Arthur was Crown Prince Wilhelms tutor

\- succeeded Moltke (see additional notes) as commander of all armies on 14th Sept 1914 (which was kept secret for a few weeks)

\- with Moltke, he pushed for war. In 1913 he urged they should attack Russia.

\- he planned the Verdun attrition. He chose Verdun so the French would fight, due to the national pride associated with Verdun.

\- - Moltke planned to have battles at Verdun and the Meuse, rather than simply advance towards Paris, which would be the 'normal' thing to do.

\- in 1916 even his staff disagreed with his battle 'defence' approach

\- even Bauer was - allegedly - 'dismayed by Falkenhayn's insistence along the Somme front on packing infantry into the foremost trenches to repel the attacks, where they were chewed-up by the Entente's artillery preparations'

\- Bauer also - allegedly - was strongly opposed to Falkenhayns attack of Verdun via the Meuse, because it exposed F's men to French artillery. And that is what happened.

\- led in Romania with Mackenzen

\- Churchill rated him highly as a general, as did Dupuy (Theres a link from Churchill to Bizmark. Churchill also commented on Moltke's doubts)

\- (nephew: field marshal F. von Bock)

\- had a contempt for democracy. Believed higher losses were better than dissent

&#x200B;

FALKENHAYN -> MOLTKE

As Moltke the Younger was in such a powerful position and related to Falkenhayn, as well as pushing more than most for the First World War, we shall briefly take a few notes about him as well:

Moltke was a madman (like Waldersee, though thats not a connection). He was also a friend of Wilhelm II. At one point during the War, even Wilhelm himself apparently doubted a fight on the Front, but Moltke continued.

Moltke was Chief of the General Staff from 1906. In 1914 he took command of all field armies. He then passed that command to Falkenhayn.

Moltke says before the war that war on the Western Front had been planned for a long time. ('long-planned') That is worth looking into by itself.

Moltke mobilised the Germany Army - Before the War.

Molkte repeatedly stated that 1914 would be the best time to start a 'preventative war'. A war preventing what, exactly? This research suspects that overthrow by public uprising was the target of prevention.

Moltke pushed for war with Britain as well as with Russia. He was a big part of the decision to go to war.

When he handed over command to Falkenhayn, he went to be the Chief of the Home Substitutes - i.e. sending the reserves to the Front.

'In private, Moltke would sometimes admit that he had doubts about Germany's actual chances of winning a future war'. Yet outwardly he presented that Germany would win.

When in command of the Battle of The Marne, he issued no orders at all to the 1st, the 2nd or the 3rd Armies, from the 2nd to the 5th of September.

Moltke was a Social Darwinist

Churchill writes of Moltkes doubts. Churchill blamed the loss of the monarchy for the political instability of the Weimar Republic.

Moltke was given British and Russian honours

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

CROWN PRINCE RUPPRECHT

Major Battles involved in, by German wounded and dead:

1st Battle of Ypres (October-November 1914) 80,000-130,000 (or 134,315)

The Battle of The Somme (July-November 1916) 434,000-445,000

3rd Battle of Ypres (Passchendael) (July-November 1917) 217,000 to 400,000

&#x200B;

\- Family links to Louis XIV of France, William the Conqueror, and Henrietta and Charles I of England

\- link through House of Hohenzollern with King Wilhelm

\- involved with Edward VIIs 1909 visit to Berlin.

\- had a Jacobite claim to the British throne. Despite this, he distanced himself from it 'for some reason'

\- he defended Wilhelm II from causing the War.

\- 'As the War turned into a protracted slaughter, many nobles had the sense that they were precipitating the demise of their class.' Presumably with the inevitable reaction to the oppression of the lower classes 

\- replaced Gallwitz, and commanded 6th Army opposite the British Expeditionary Force

\- lead Army Group Rupprecht. Adjutant: von Stetten

\- in 1917 he said the war cannot be won, yet still pursued an aggressive policy

\- refused to denounce his familys throne in the Revolution

\- was treated well by the US (Eisenhower) as late as 1945

\- after the War he met with George V for lunch - at least once - discussing politics. Despite allegedly being his direct enemy in the War.

\- British and Belgian honours

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

ALBRECHT VON WURTTEMBURG

Major Battles involved in, by German wounded and dead:

1st Battle of The Marne (September 1914) 256,000

1st Battle of Ypres (October-November 1914) 80,000-130,000 (or 134,315)

&#x200B;

\- of those found to be responsible for the most casualties of men under their command, there are no fewer than three heirs to German thrones. A throne that would be lost in the event of an uprising. These crown princes who are also chief suspects are: Crown Prince Wilhelm, Rupprecht of Bavaria, and (like Rupprecht, 6th Army) Albrecht von Wurttemburg.

\- 2nd cousin of George V's wife

\- descendant of French Phillipe I, who was forced out in Revolution 1848 (and Orleans II)

\- attented Edward VIIs funeral

\- related somehow to Belgian Leopold II

\- commanded 4th Army and Army Group Albrecht. His chief of staff was Walter von Luttwitz

\- he was possibly the first to use poison gas in battle

\- led in the Ardennes with Crown Prince Wilhelm

\- he led Southern Sector of the Western Front

\- he succeeded the headship from William II of Wurrtemburg, who was the last German ruler to abdicate due to the German Revolution

\- he didnt renounce his throne

\- British honour

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

VON LINSINGEN

Major Battles involved in, by German wounded and dead:

1st Battle of Ypres (October-November 1914) 80,000-130,000 (or 134,315)

The Brusilov Offensive (June-September 1916) 148,000-350,000

&#x200B;

\- was one of the very few top German generals not to have served on the General Staff.

\- his predecessors were in the British-led Kings German Legion in the 19th century

\- one of these, Carl, lived in the English elite, and even led in battle alongside Wellington - even once commanding the British Legion - and remained a British general until his death. His son was naturalised in England, and it seems the son was in the House of Lords.

\- promoted to Colonel General (2nd highest rank) by Wilhelm II

\- was confident that nothing was lost, even in 1918, so long as Berlin was held.

\- in late March 1918 his Army Group was disbanded - in June he became the Military Governor of Berlin

&#x200B;

The main evidence for potential foul play by Alexander von Linsingen is the death toll in his command (while alongside stronger suspects), and his hereditary ties to the British elite. As well as his disinterest in losses of men under his command so long as Berlin's command structure was safe.

&#x200B;

The following four or five commanders have lower but still very high numbers of casualties in their names. In Mackenzens case, his connections are also noteworthy.

&#x200B;

MACKENZEN

The Romanian Campaign

&#x200B;

\- Selected as adjutant to new cheif Schlieffen (who he considered a great instructor on leading armies of millions of men)

\- Adjutant to Wilhelm II. Was very loyal to him. the first commoner to hold this position of adjutant to the King

\- his son Hans George was childhood friends with Wilhelms son August Wilhelm. 'homophillic relationship'. His sons and Wilhelms sons shared gymnastics classes.

\- for 3 1/2 years he accompanied Wilhelm II meeting German, continental and middle-Eastern rulers and nobility

\- 'Ennobled' by Wilhelm on the Kaisers 40th birthday (1899)

\- in 1908 the Crown Prince was placed under his command. Wilhelm asked Mackensen to keep an eye on him and teach him riding etc.

\- part of the German Eighth Army in East Prussia, under Prittwitz and shortly after, under General Paul von Hindenburg.

\- in 1914 he took command of the 9th Army from Hindenberg (who became Supreme Commander East (Oberbefehlshaber Ost))

\- he led on the opposite flank to Falkenhayn in Romania

\- he led in the battles of Gumbinnen, Tannenberg, and the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes. And later fighting in Łódź. These are exactly the same battles as led by Paul von Rennenkampf, who, as a Russian with a German name, was allegedly on the Russian side - but was nonetheless widely accused of being a 'German traitor to Russia', along with Silvers, Muller and others.

\- the Austro-Hungarian supreme command agreed Mackenzen should command the A-H/German coalition army

\- As chief of staff, he was assigned Hans von Seeckt. His army group had an overwhelming advantage in artillery.

\- he was once said to be a ""hands-on commander with the instincts of a hunter.""

\- he was honoured by a dinner and a personal audience with Emperor Franz Joseph, and decorated with a magnificent cross that foreigners otherwise werent awarded

\- Even after 1918, he remained an unapologetic high-profile monarchist traditionalist

\- initially he avoided public campaigns but around 1924 he changed his mind and began to use his image as a 'war hero' to support monarchist groups

\- he got very active in pro-military Conservative Revolutionary movement organisations, particularly Der Stahlhelm, like a few other suspects, and the mysterious Schlieffen Society

\- the Kaiser decided to name a battlecruiser after him, as he had all other Prussian awards, and generally the highest orders in Germany and its allies

\- even with age difficulties he attended the funeral of Wilhelm II in Holland

\- He objected to the killing of Schleicher (and of F. von Bredow) during The Night of the Long Knives

\- he was one of the 896 Germans on the Allied list of accused war criminals, which eventually \*was allowed to lapse\*.

\- despite this, after the Second World War he was briefly captured by the British, and yet released. No punnishment was administered - as usual with all other generals here and in the other countries

\- received British honour

\- received the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross in 1914 along with Kaiser Wilhelm II, Paul von Hindenburg (Star of), Erich Ludendorff, and Prince Leopold of Bavaria

\- those who awarded him with medals include the German States, Hohenzollern, Britain and Russia (with the Order of St. Anna 1st class)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

FRITZ VON BELOW

The Battle of The Somme

Operation Michael (the Spring Offensive)

Second Battle of The Aisne (The Nivelle Offensive)

&#x200B;

\- in the 2nd Army - command was taken from von Bulow and given to Gallwitz

\- with Gallwitz as cheif, he then commanded the men who bore the brunt of the allied attack, the 2nd Army, in The Somme.  

\- was preceded by Mackenzen in Army Group Below

\- through the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, Fritz von Below could have cooperated with von Linsingen and possibly Falkenhayn

\- in 1918 Johannes von Eben (see below) relieved him when ill

&#x200B;

OTTO von Below, Fritz cousin: commanded 'Army of the Niemen' (formed May 1915) ""The use of poison gas by the Germans was (a part of) the collapse of the Italian Second Army."" ""A breakdown in German logistics brought the battle to a close on the line of the Piave River and the front soon froze again in trench warfare. Below was involved in preparations for a possible final battle on German territory (Home Defense Forces West)"".

Otto von Below: in Operation Michael, he commanded the 17th Army, while the 2nd Army of Rupprechts Army Group was led by von der Marwitz, with another army from Crown Prince Wilhelms Army Group - all overseen by Ludendorff.

Otto v. Below retired in 1919. A post-war attempt by the Allies to try him as a war criminal failed.\[4 - source no additional data\] 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

JOHANNES VON EBEN

The Romanian Campaign

(1st Battle of The Marne at Corps level)

2nd Battle of The Marne

&#x200B;

\- a tactics teacher for five years beginning 1 October 1895 at the Kriegsakademie in Berlin, who also studied the relationship between infantry and artillery

\- linked directly to Wilhelm II, Ludendorff, and Mackenzen

\- was given a leadership role in the Ministry of War in 1905. Wilhelm II elevated him into Prussian hereditary peerage in 1906.

\- Wilhelm II awarded him command of a division on the Kaisers birthday in 1912. Soon after he was promoted to Lieutenant-General.

\- led under the command of Karl von Bulow

\- took part in leading all three Battles of the Aisne, as well as 1st of The Marne and Gen. Erich Ludendorff's Champagne-Marne offensive - the Second Battle of The Marne - and the Meuse-Argonne offensive

I was born with a very mild version of Down’s Syndrome. It’s mostly the physiological side, as I have made a lot of intellectual progress despite the condition. I can write a lot better than I can talk, although it takes a very long time. Let me tell you a little about myself before we get to the main point:

I like the movie Fight Club a lot. I also like The Dark Knight a lot and I relate to Tyler Durden and The Joker. They are awake to the problems of society and I agree with them. There is the part in Fight Club where he says “I wanted to destroy something beautiful” , so I did the same. It was really hard but I threw my favorite Jordan Pederson book off the roof of a hotel, but I made sure to have a paperback copy hidden in my toy room just in case I need to read it again. 

I really like Joker and I bet he has a twisted origin story. I’d like to see what happened that made him so cool and twisted awake.

But yeah I like Tyler Durden a lot too. I got the audiobook of Fight Club and after listening to it, I’m pretty sure Tyler Durden is a high functioning Down’s Syndrome man just like me, and I want to meet Chuck Palahniuk some day so I can confirm this. Me and Tyler are pretty much the same person.

Ok so now you know a lot about me. Let’s talk about my mom.

A long time ago my mom found out from a doctor test that I was going to be born with Downs Syndrome. She still went through with it and had me. My life has been really hard because of my condition, but I get a lot of help. I even have my helper helping me write this. Ha ha.

I found out from my dad that he wanted to abort me and try again so they could have a healthy baby. It hurt my feelings to find this out, but over time I ended up realizing that dad was right. Despite all of the doctors opinions and what my dad wanted, she still had me. I will never live a normal life, and I hate my mom for that. She allowed me to have defects because her decision was considered more important than my dads. I hate you mom. I hate you for allowing me to be defective in this society. Dad should’ve had the final decision. 

Thank you for your time and listening to my opinion

1498040258.0,This post is PRECISELY what's wrong...,"... that women are being told this is sexual assault. And then to turn to peers on the internet to have them justify your stance. It's sick. 

If you don't want to read it, here's the gist. Girl admittedly is a horn dog that had traditional values. Let the guy have sex with her. They've been dating for over a year. Always wore condoms. One day he broaches the topic of not using a condom. She admitted to how the thought of it turned her on. But told him no. They go and get condoms, had a great night, one thing led to another and they're having sex. At some point she ""realizes"" he didn't put on a condom (eye-roll).  She gets up and leaves him sitting there, sad looking. Here's the kicker, she asks if this is sexual assault. And if you read the comments, some actually tell her it is sexual assault. Mind blown. This is how innocent guys end up in jail. Sure, he's a douche for not taking her serious. But sexual assault? That's too far.

>An increase in the influence of women in public life has often been associated with national decline. **The later Romans complained that, although Rome ruled the world, women ruled Rome.** In the tenth century, a similar tendency was observable in the Arab Empire, **the women demanding admission to the professions hitherto monopolised by men.** ‘What,’ wrote the contemporary historian, Ibn Bessam, ‘have the professions of clerk, tax-collector or preacher to do with women? These occupations have always been limited to men alone.’ Many women practised law, **while others obtained posts as university professors.** There was an agitation for the appointment of female judges, which, however, does not appear to have succeeded. Soon after this period, government and public order collapsed, and foreign invaders overran the country. The resulting increase in confusion and violence made it unsafe for women to move unescorted in the streets, with the result that this feminist movement collapsed.

First of all, exactly how many of these ""false rape accusers"" are for sure and not just alleged?  Believe it or not there are men who get away with rape and there are women who are branded false accusers when they actually aren't.  Is any of this based on solid proof or just accusations?

Secondly, where are the male offenders?  Surely this website was made because someone was upset about ""all male"" offender sites being sexist... Well making an all female offender site is just hypocrisy, plain and simply.

Why not have an area on the site with males who have gotten away with raping other males (particularly prison cases)?  How about males who have falsely accused others of rape?

Exactly how legit is this website?  It seems to only focus on women who have allegedly hurt men... Why not include women who have hurt women, men who have hurt men, and men who have hurt women?  By not doing this you're being huge hypocrites.

The fact that I feel this way does not in any way go against my support of certain aspects of feminism. In fact, I would call myself a feminist, if not for the inaccurate gender implications.

""Feminism"" doesn't say that men and women are the same, it says that neither is intrinsically better, or objectively worth more. If a man is wrongly convicted of rape, that is prejudice. If a father is criticized for accompanying his children to a playground on the basis that he is a *man*, that is also prejudice. And the list goes on.

Very interesting learning experience, I understand feminism better now.","So last night, I decided to do a little experiment on omegle, and posed as a feminist. I used to interest tab to search for people interested in ""feminism"" and ""feminists"", and played the role of a feminist, based mostly on conversations with feminists I've had over the years. I went more towards the negative feminists I've seen, so I hope people know this by no means reflects all feminists.
 
I had a lot of very interesting conversations, and I'm postings some of them here. This was a really significant learning experience for me, I definitely understand feminism better now. I have to admit, the power was intoxicating. Being openly sexist had a certain primal appeal, like the satisfaction a bully might feel, or that glow you feel after delivering a ""zinger."" I can understand how people can sucked into radical groups of any kind, even radical MRAs.
 
I talked to men, women, feminists and MRAs, and had a wide range of responses. Some people were negative, some were positive, and it was interesting to see how different people responded. I've written up a report with a few of my favorites:
 
1. This one was one of my favorites because it really showed how MRAs are maturing their theory and arguments against feminism. He had very good responses when I discussed privilege, and how sexism can't apply to men: http://logs.omegle.com/57af4ef
 
2. This one was encouraging. A self-identified typical feminist responds negatively to circumcision, and to white male bullying. She recognized why bullying to compensate privilege was wrong, and that circumcision was ""harm."": http://logs.omegle.com/7c04bfc7
 
3. This one also very encouraging. A female feminist recognized that supporting circumcision because you enjoy the idea of men losing sexual pleasure is sexist. : http://logs.omegle.com/81f0348
 
4. This was another MRA who demonstrated maturation of MRM theory. Good conversation about rape culture and circumcision. His last line was very good in particular- ""your assumiption that something is outside of my understanding because of my race and sex is racist and sexist."" http://logs.omegle.com/d22966b
 
5. Here, a female feminists rejected the idea that sexism against men couldn't existed, and rejected the idea of enjoying sexism against men. http://logs.omegle.com/17c9f37
 
6. Here, a female feminist said that circumcision wasn't a good way to check privilege, implying that white males didn't deserve to be circumcised. Also acknowledged that circumcision is ""harm"". http://logs.omegle.com/a943422
 
7. Another MRA doing a good job of defending mens rights against feminism. Don't really like his opening line, though. http://logs.omegle.com/06e3c0b
 
8. This one mirrored an experience I've had with feminism, bullying an autistic boy because he's a white male. Don't worry, I ran into him later and explained everything, and he approved once he understood what I was doing http://logs.omegle.com/b89bd1b

Calling a bitch a bitch : Not misogyny

I haven't had much exposure to men's rights activism apart from feminist friends posting nonsense spouted by self-described MRA's. I reckon it's fairly likely that most of your experience with feminism is the same. I've poked around this sub and seen a fair bit of it.

Thing is, poking around this sub I've seen a lot of real issues. Boys being bullied and sexually abused, child custody, false accusations, suicide, all that. You guys are basically right about all that. I still call myself feminist rather than MRA because of other things; women got problems too (and I think where you fall on feminism/MRM depends largely on your experience since it's hard to quantify which gender has it harder when most of us haven't seen both sides), but I agree with you that these are all big issues.

Three reasons why I'm not a card-carrying meninist:

* Feminism has accomplished a hell of a lot over the past few years on which we can all agree. Decent stuff. The vote, jobs, better legal protection, closer-to-equal pay and a continued change in public discourse about women. In many circles it's no longer expected that women will be the head of the household while the men work, it's just one of many viable options. Granted men's rights activism isn't as old, but where are its accomplishments and what, practically, are members of the movement doing to achieve its aims? Are there any examples of men's shelters being run or suicide hotlines for men or financial support and legal advocacy for unfair child maintenance or anything like that?

* There's a hell of a lot of feminist-bashing in this sub. I see some MRA-bashing in feminist circles, but it's nothing compared to what you guys have. I don't think ""hurr, stupid feminist"" is useful discourse to deal with gender issues. I think you ought to take a harder line against that kind of talk in your group to be taken seriously as a political movement for good. There are a lot of feminists I distance myself from, but I feel if I joined the men's rights movement I'd be distancing myself from the majority rather than a fringe, y'know?

* We're already fighting the same things. Every single one of the problems I listed above is caused by the patriarchy. Men are supposed to be strong and in charge so they can't express their emotions and are more likely to be violent and held responsible for violence. Women are supposed to be meek and that's why they are more likely to get away with crimes they do commit and be believed when they make accusations. A man's place is in work so he pays for the children and a woman's place is in the home so she gets custody. If we didn't have these ingrained gender roles caused by centuries of male rule, neither feminism nor men's rights activism would have to exist. Linked to my previous point, why are we not on the same side? And yes, I've read the article in your sidebar. The very premise of ""feminists support legal bigotry and MRA's don't"" is incredibly flawed and the author argues strongly for division while simultaneously listing a bunch of issues that have the same root cause feminism intends to fight against. Why are we not on the same side?

I might be wrong on all of this. I'm posting here to get out of my comfort zone and find some opinions that are different to my own so I can learn something. I'm grateful for any discourse you'd be willing to give and I'm not simply here to convince you of my viewpoint.

Although if there's one thing I'd convince you of, it's this:

Any time you see or hear anyone talk about men or women unfairly in the context of traditional gender roles: Challenge it.


**EDIT**

Just wanted to pop back to say thanks so much to everyone who replied. I didn't expect to change minds or for mine to be changed, but I have learned a lot about what you believe on the subject. Talking to people with whom you disagree is a very useful exercise, both to grow personally and to learn how to better interact with different types of people.

Most of what I've learned from this thread is your opinion of feminism and what you see feminism to be, but my original opinion that the MRM and feminism belong together hasn't really changed. Feminism doesn't have to benefit men to be valid, but it does. And I can't speak for all feminists, because there are a tonne of different strands and ideas and whatnot out there, but for me I feel passionate about a lot of the same issues as yourselves and that gives me hope for the future of gender issues. We need to spend much less time and energy fighting each other and we could all do a lot of good.

Finally, an apology. I had to duck out abruptly yesterday and do real life so I wasn't able to participate in the discussion any further. This also meant a few short responses. I did read everything that came back from it but in my own time later on and with comment notifications switched off. I have a busy job and there's only so much time I can spend with Internet arguments.

This thing does not invite bad characters to participate in it. They have to change in order to be allowed, and that makes them very upset. [This user said it best](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/10562ff/comment/j391tk4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ""Congratulations, you're making a difference big enough to get active negative feedback for it 😅"" We *are* making a big difference. There is no denying that reality.

It is literally the safest space for men on the internet. I have all kinds of automod guards in place to keep the trash out. You are free to speak your minds there :) Just make sure you follow the rules.

We are fiscally sponsored as a nonprofit as well and we are preparing to accept grants and donations from foundations. I'm actually applying for a $100,000 grant to help men in prison with their mental health, and since I have been to prison twice, [according to the application](https://imgur.com/gallery/gbQaBit), they like that. It will help things along nicely for us.

Be sure to check out the About Tab/Side Bar. Bunch of info there and it will be constantly being updated. I am working on organizing things much better.

I just want to make sure that you understand that we are very serious here. Don't come into this subreddit trying to change things. Everyone there is there with the understanding that I have set a foundation for this movement. It's not going to be changed for anyone. It's working very nicely. If you decide to come in a cause problems, I very rarely give second chances. Use the space as intended. Make sure you read the rules. We are here to grow, to mature. We don't point fingers and push blame on others. That's not how men should act. Own your life, and then fix it. r/GuyCry is a toolbox for life. 

Other than that, try to respect mine and our members time please. We are here to help how we can. Take the space seriously and hopefully your lives will begin to change.

See you at the sub if you are coming. Be safe.

They are not. Men’s rights should not be a rebuttal to women’s rights, it discredits the movement and makes me wonder if half of the people even care about men’s rights at all or just care about being contrarian to the feminist movement. The same systems that fuck over women fuck over men in different ways. It is missing the point to use men’s rights to oppose women’s rights and it is absolutely stupid. Our system is fundamentally flawed and if we worked together with the feminists we’d find much more success because both women and men experience inequality in different ways. So many posts here seem to respond to women’s rights movements instead of just pointing out some of the inequalities faced by men. It alienates half of the population to do this and will result in the dissolution of and further discrediting of the men’s rights movement.

1676170978.0,Spot the Manipulation: Tolerance Edition,"Tolerate seems to be primarily a word of manipulation. 

Being asked to tolerate something implies that it comes at a cost to you. 

The person asking you to tolerate it is asking you to pay a cost. Almost always, they are okay with this cost, or it is not a cost to them. 

Ex:

- Parent, trying to work, asking you to tolerate your sibling being obnoxious
- Tolerating something new in your town. New people. New corporation. Etc. 

------------

The parent is asking you to ""tolerate"" the sibling, so that they don't have to get involved. They are asking you to suck up (pay a cost) of something you dislike, for their benefit. 

The *should* is what does it. It vaguely implies that doing so is somehow good for you. If it wasn't good for you, why should you do it after all?

Worse still, tolerance is often couched in manipulative moral overtones:

""You're a bad person if you won't tolerate what I want"" is a common implication.

Tolerance is frequently a sneaky way of trying to evade responsibility and dodge the fact that they want you to pay their costs for them. 

In healthy, reciprocal interaction at a minimum they should be upfront about this: 

""I know I'm asking you to bear this burden, will you do it for me?""

Even better is if they are assuming your costs. Offering to compensate you in some way for bearing that burden.

Or if it's a potential risk (company building a new waste plant), being willing to forebear that cost if it turns out to impose on you.

In fact, under free market, things can be tested. Just let every company choose which one they want to hire. Companies that hire women will make less profit. Perhaps in time of abundance this is not a matter of life and death. But given most business fail, it can be.

1415344311.0,Mens rights is the New Feminism,"MRA is the New Feminism. I am not making this claim as a rhetorical gesture in some courageous underground battle on the war on women. I am simply going to point to similarities between the *academic* position on feminism and the MRA position. Since the academics are always around 15 years before the mainstream, it's a done deal that MRA is the future. 

It has struck me as odd in the last 5 years, that the actual physical representations of my disgust with aspects of modern feminisms, upon closer inspection, tended not to be your regular career woman. They seemed to be old-fashioned conservative men and slightly odd women, usually with a noticeable personality disorder, perhaps borderline personality disorder but also narcissistic personality disorder kept popping up.  

I have always thought that women were equals in society. They have broadly the same abilities as men and I've always being agnostic as to their potential capabilities. I take the J.S. Mill argument that he used when people argued marriage was natural: if marriage is so natural why all these stringent laws to enforce it. 

And the MRA position that I read seems to be that it:
>  understands the unavoidable connections between one group’s claims to equality 
and emancipation and everyone else’s claims to the same. In society, we 
are all on the same boat. ...acknowledges that a break should be 
taken from the traditional instantiations of “feminist” discourse in order to 
discuss what it would mean for women to possess equal agency and responsibility,  while  still  maintaining  a  critical  eye  on  the  systems  that 
women are now not only subject to, but which women are also creating. 
As it turns out – and who is surprised? – not all injustice and oppression can be reduced to the subjection of women. Feminism will leave its self imposed marginalization only when its claims to empowerment and equality are carved in universalizable terms that can be extended to all victims 
of injustice and oppression, from unparented children, to the disabled, to 
the poor and the stateless. 

....except this is a description of the ""third moment"" of feminisim (!) as written by Ms Owens(1) in the *Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Review* in 2013.

What the MRA seem to be fighting is the ""second moment"" of feminism. Those nutty radical found in the anti-MRA subreddit and the femininism subreddit are past history. They just didn't get the memo. This second moment we are pretty familiar with:
> radical feminism, cultural feminism, anti-essentialist feminism, critical race feminism, sex positive feminism, etc. — and the various epistemological, ontological, causal, 
> and normative views of each varied greatly. 
> However, a common accusation  among  second-generation  feminists  was  that  society/law/politics/economy/culture  was  inherently  male-gendered,  and  no 
> surface  reform  would  change  that.

Ms Owens makes a remark that may come as a shock to this group of ol'-Skool feminists:
> I submit that, though there are certainly inequalities heretofore in existence, women are 
> now able to act as agents in their own lives — they are not simply victims

This will come as no surprise to MRA supporters, who see vast numbers of decisions as down to women, although MRA persons may feel feminists have been unwilling to take the responsibility for this agency. And Ms Owens understands this is key:

> I argue that the universalizable core of feminism’s calls for justice and 
equality is best understood as a claim to equal moral agency. The way to 
universalize feminism is to strive so that no one’s agency is counted out, 
and  everyone  is  equally  empowered  and  equally  responsible.    Hence, 
moral agency can be used as a litmus test in determining the universality 
of feminist claims.

She then moves to the hot topic of abrogation of parental rights. That is:

>  biological fathers who do not wish to become legal and social fathers and the rights that they have to reproductive 
autonomy  as  a  corollary  to  women’s  full-fledged  moral  agency. 

And so she asserts:
>  For 
women to make a truly independent decision, the woman must not be able 
to rely on the assumption that there will be a man to help her. 


And with her logical support of the MRA position on this in mind:

> The feminist movement was not meant to be a 
shifting of the power imbalance from one camp to the other, but rather a 
balancing of the rights and autonomy enjoyed by both men and women. 
The best reconstruction of the many claims advanced in and by feminism 
sees  them  as  demands  for  equal  respect  and  consideration  of  women’s 
moral agency. Put in other words, if feminism is a universal concept, it 
must be characterized by the idea that women want autonomy and want to 
be  considered  equal,  grown-up  partners  in  the  making  and  remaking  of 
society. 

And I think that about wraps it up. I don't even think there is an inch of a difference between her position and many core MRA supporters. 

>  we do not seek freedom only 
> to oppress. It is precisely because of the enormous and very real gains 
> made  for  women  in  an  almost  unbelievably  short  number  of  years  that

1404518986.0,Typical behavior of spoiled children/feminists.,"I just googled typical behavior of spoiled children and this was the first hit. Am i wrong or does it seem like typical feminist behavior?


**High Expectations**

A spoiled child expects everything to be handed to them. They are unwilling to work for something they want, whether it's a tangible item, an achievement at school or a position on a sports team. This lack of work ethic can manifest in the child's behavior in several ways. Spoiled children do not understand the advantages and rewards of setting goals and working to achieve them. Thus, they expect handouts and often fail to achieve as a result. Spoiled children often do not understand the consequences of hard work.


**Temper Tantrums**

Temper tantrums are a seemingly inevitable part of your child's development. Occasional tantrums during the toddler years, particularly around the age of 2, are normal. However, spoiled children will continue these tantrums beyond the toddler years. If your child is still throwing tantrums when they are entering kindergarten -- or beyond -- this behavior is likely related to being spoiled. Spoiled children frustrate easily, and this trait, coupled with their high expectations, can lead to tantrums.


**Disrespect for Rules and Others**

Spoiled children remain focused on themselves. Thus, they have little regard for rules and routinely ignore them. As a result, these children are unwilling to compromise with you, their siblings or their friends. Spoiled children get used to receiving what they want, and when rules develop that deny them of things, they get frustrated and angry, and refuse to compromise. Just like spoiled children lack respect for rules, they also lack respect for others. They often display rude behavior without realizing the effect it has on those around them.


**Unsatisfied**

The spoiled child is difficult to satisfy. They adjust to a lack of rules and limits in their life and, as a result, always wants more. Likewise, spoiled children get bored easily because they focus on what they do not have rather than what they do have. If your child demands more rather than appreciating what they have, this behavior might be associated with being spoiled.

Has anyone else here watched the 11th season of Hell's Kitchen and been really frustrated about the treatment towards the men? Yes, I understand that it's supposed to be good natured fun where the winning team gets luxurious prizes and the losing team suffers humiliating punishments. Yet my frustration continued to mount as the men lost almost every competition. 

If the men's team was substantially worse than the women's team, I would understand. Yet it seemed to me as if both teams started out pretty equal. There were a fair share of talented and dysfunctional people on both teams. Yet in events where both teams were almost equal, I feel as if Chef Ramsey let the point go to the women out of chivalry (as well as catering to the viewers).

There was also that event where the men won, by capturing more lobsters than the women - one guy broke his ankle to do so and refused medical attention. But instead of even getting anything for their victory, chef Ramsy was like, ""You think that is winning? That wasn't even the challenge."" 

The women continued to win more and more prizes, spa days, great food and luxury yacht trips as the men had to eat fish heads and ride around on a broken bus in the desert - I think that the women's team was relaxed, had their confidence boosted and got the treatment that helped them continue to score successive victories, while each humiliating failure continued to demoralize, stress out and ultimately build the men's team up for failure. 

I would like the show better if they split the teams up randomly, rather than by males and females, so it would be less of a gender war. I just want to watch a dramatic show about food - but instead I feel like the treatment of the men is so horrible I can't even watch the show anymore. 

Am I the only one who feels this way? (btw, I'm female)",MensRights

The freedom for women to vote and own property and not be viewed as property is a good thing. Noone should treat another human being as they would their property. Noone has the right to treat another human being as less regarding intelligence ect ect. 

However, I as a woman see what other women are doing to men.. putting up bullshit signs saying DONT RAPE. I mean come on. REALLY?! I see women ABUSING their rights. And literally getting away with such terrible crimes. And they get a slap on the wrist so to speak JUST because they are women. That folks.. is WRONG.  What ever happened to people treating each other with respect.. common decency..being equal in most things. And yeah for the feminists reading my post I said MOST things. I am sorry but yeah there are things men can do better. There are things women can do better.. its NATURES design.
its a DAMN sad state of affairs when women bitch because they get hurt on jobs that men get killed on.. where was this outcry when men got injured or killed. WHERE was the outrage when men get beaten and raped.. yeah men can get raped to.... but since they are men I dont suppose it matters. BULLSHIT... it matters because they are HUMAN BEINGS. 

I say to hell with feminism.... why because its been twisted and torn from what it was originally... I think feminists should take a good hard long look at THEMSELVES. Because they are making it HARD on women like me who try to treat EVERYONE the same. HUMAN rights folks.. not womens rights... not mens rights(although I can understand WHY men have to have a group for it now)

Yeah I am mad. Why.. because with all this feminism going on my son wont be able to enjoy good healthy relationships if he runs into some of the crazy feminists out there. who will label him a rapist if he is kind or helpful to a woman. 

Yeah I agree with Mens rights.. fully and whole heartily. I think SOMETHINGS gotta change..Somethings gotta be done to keep feminism in check. And I know i'll probably get flamed and put down for my view points on it all. I dont care.
When a woman can RUIN a mans life from a simple false accusation. Or kill her children.. or molest a minor and get away with it..somethings gotta be done.. when women do all the horrible things and just get away with it.. when a man can do very little and his life ruined... somethings gotta change.

I say change it we got to folks. Because there will come a time when  feminists will need men for help. and honestly.. I wouldnt blame men if they said no.. I wouldnt blame them one bit.

so yeah thats some of my views on feminism and mens right.. I say keep on with what your doing for mens rights. MEN are HUMAN to. And they deserve to be treated with just as much respect and honor that women expect. Sorry women.. you cant act like brats and expect ME to agree with it.

Unfortunately, due to the apparent stupidity of some, it’s necessary to preemptively address some of the predictable criticisms of this post.



The claim that inclusion of [redacted] on Register-Her constitutes “doxing” is stupid on it’s face. She was bragging about her participation through her own facebook and twitter accounts prior to publication by us. The closure and switching to private of her social media accounts indicates her own consciousness of guilt. She was perfectly happy to have her name, face, and actions tied together when the only people taking notice were her fellow sociopaths, it’s only the touch of public criticism that’s motivating her to hide her online social media accounts.



Also, to the predictable idiots claiming we’re facilitating violence by this publication – you’re morons. The only people advocating or engaging in violence in this drama are the activist feminists. This MRM is strictly non violent, a fact demonstrated so often it is monotonous and boring. If some pea-brain wishes to claim that publication and public accountability is dangerous because it might facilitate some bad-brained moron to engage in retributive violence – kindly provide a workable mechanism for public accountability which is totally and perfectly safe – then criticize us for not using it. Until then, SFTU.

addendum: I know I'm not going to make friends by calling people ""morons"" and ""pea-brains"". It's fortunate that making friends is lower on my priority list than opposing the male-targeted hatred and violence and censorship our esteemed opponents on the opposite side of this conflict appear so keen to promote. 



And if your feeling were hurt, or you were offended by anything in the preceding several paragraphs, I suggest you evaluate whether your feelings or the human rights of men and boys matter more to you.


Also, to the individual in this sub-reddit who recently informed me they would cut my throat, kindly send me an email letting me know when you'll be in Vancouver and where, I'll meet you at whatever time and place you prefer, and I'll stand, eyes closed and hands behind my back while you get on with your knife work.

1685965001.0,Why do people falsely accuse someone of rape or sexual assault?," 

In recent years, there has been a tremendous amount of discussion on the subject of **sexual assault**. Much of the conversation on the subject was a result of the #MeToo movement, and little of the discussion has centered on *false allegations* of rape and sexual assault.

Despite the fear of false rape and sexual assault allegations, the reality is that false reporting of this nature is low according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.

#### Though rare, false accusations do occasionally happen.

When they do, here are some more common reasons underpinning most false accusation cases.

## Main types of false allegation cases

Criminal justice and sexual violence authorities generally classify false allegation cases into 2 broad categories:

1. False allegations accusations arising from **false memories**.
2. False allegation cases stemming from a person making **intentionally inaccurate allegations**.

### 1. False memories of rape and sexual assault

From time to time, a person truly believes that he or she was the victim of sexual assault based on what psychologists refer to as “**false memories**.”

The human brain is complex. Indeed, entire disciplines exist to study the brain and its mechanics. Memories are generally thought to be a reliable recounting of something that actually, factually occurred. But in reality, there are many instances in which the brain creates false memories, according to Psychology Today.

Such a memory can feel so “real” to a person that it convinces them into believing that it is a factual recollection of an experienced event. One example of such a false memory is the erroneous memory of a rape or sexual assault that didn’t actually occur.

Allegations arising from false memory are most common among young children, who may have been manipulated by an adult to believe that they were sexually assaulted. Since childrens’ minds aren’t fully developed, they may be more vulnerable and susceptible to false memory implantation.

### 2. Intentionally false reporting of rape and sexual assault allegations

In a majority of false allegation cases, a person intentionally lies about being the victim of rape or sexual assault. Not only do they falsely claim to have been victimized, they may go so far as to file a police report. This false report can then progress further to the criminal prosecution of an innocent person in a sexual assault or rape case.

Though unthinkable, there exist a myriad of reasons why a person might falsely report a rape or sexual assault. Some of the more common of ulterior motivations we encounter include:

* Revenge
* Material (monetary) gain
* To create an alibi
* To express regret
* To generate sympathy
* To draw attention
* To express anger
* To deny a consensual sexual encounter
* Mental instability
* To gain leverage in a custody or divorce proceeding

Intentional misstatements accusing an innocent person of rape or sexual assault can result in both civil and criminal penalties. A person who was falsely accused can pursue a false allegations lawsuit. If a person files a police report containing an intentionally false accusation of rape or sexual assault, that individual can be charged with a crime as well. Law enforcement and prosecutors don’t take kindly to false criminal reports since it wastes their time and resources.

## Protecting your legal rights in a false accusation lawsuit

It’s true that, statistically speaking, the likelihood of being falsely accused of rape or sexual assault is low. However, the reality is that when a false allegation of rape or sexual assault is indeed made against an innocent person, that individual’s life is turned upside down. An allegation of sexual impropriety can permanently stain an individual’s reputation, even when a determination ultimately occurs that the accuser accidentally or deliberately made a false accusation.

All defendants in Texas have the legal right to pursue what’s known as a false accusations lawsuit. A false accusation lawsuit is a type of personal injury case that seeks to reimburse the subject of the false allegations for monetary damages. Prevailing in this type of case necessitates the engagement of an experienced, tenacious false accusations lawsuit lawyer.",MensRights

Basically we were arguing and he pulls out, “we not having sex because I only have sex with women who would be good mothers”. This upset me. I also date for marriage and I see a future with us but he says I will reach our kids that all men are evil and he doesn’t want our son being taught he is evil because he is a man.

I have said things like all men are evil and stuff like “it’s just boys” as a joke but he’s really taken it to heart and he thinks I actually think that men are inherently evil and he wants someone that respects him. I usually take things a tad too far in arguments and say things I don’t mean by exaggerating my views to make more of a point when in reality I don’t actually think that.

However we recently disagreed on abortion and I just got upset and he said people should use contraception and that it is literally a life. I tried argue and he disagreed.

He’s now saying we disagree on too many fundamental things.

Amidst all these posts and all, I have one realization. Perhaps I achieved nirvana. That wherever we stand today for men's rights in society is because of our fellow male members only. Sorry, not men, but I should call them simps of our community. Women tend to unite together and raise their voices, unlike men. And nothing is ever going to change, gentlemen. 

I guess this is biology- perhaps from thousands of decades ago, the wilderness that men had to fight other men has taken this shape today. Under the disguise of modernism, men are still the same- just that we have now resorted to nonviolent methods to try to belittle our peers and rise above them. War has always been in men's blood, and today, as long as the guy thinks his life is going well, everything's good for him. Women, unlike this, tend to see themselves as a group fighting for better lives for their community.

Under the disguise of respect for women, all of us males are just simps- some of higher order, some of lesser (all of us, including you and me. The age-old genes are still there, no matter how modernized we become). And this is how nature created us; it was also rightfully required thousands of years ago for the survival of our species. 

**Women will never advocate for men; I repeat, never.** I have seen enough examples to support this statement, and I do not care if a random stranger on the internet judges me or not over this. Go and check social media comments- you'll quickly find men on posts advocating support for women, but when the tables turn, there are hardly any females doing the same. 

Ultimately, all of this leads me to one thing- despair. Feminist movements have reached the roots of society (and that's a great thing, too), but at the expense of men's rights. **And unlike women, men will never care about their fellows as long as their life is good.**

*Our community members laugh at us if we talk about our rights. The same was never the case with women's movements.*

Only the world is becoming crueler and crueler to men. And this is the biggest reason this campaign will never succeed, or if it does, I am not living by then. Because I see no positive change happening till the time I am alive. Only negatives. 

So basically, all I can see are three things-

1. That men's rights campaigns will never be successful, Not because the cause is not good. But because the majority of the very same people (99.99999%) for whom we are talking about rights- do not care at all about it as long as things go according to them in life, and only when they are fucked up for some reason- they realize the importance of men's rights. On the other hand, the feminist movement was successful because it garnered support from its community (women) and had the added advantage of men supporting it. 
2. *So movement for women = (women + men) supporting it, whereas campaigning for men = (no women + 0.0001% of men) supporting it.*
3. ***We are ultimately heading toward the collapse of civilization.***",MensRights
1580583820.0,MRAs refuse to acknowledge the vast majority of people mocking male sexual assault are males.,"Shit found on GenderCritical. That MRAs refuse to acknowledge the vast majority of people mocking male sexual assault are males.

First of all, notice how our biggest problem is not who's doing it rather the fact it's a problem. If it's bad that we don't care who's the problem then what are you trying to stop?

>The hypocrisy is so obvious and it's mind-boggling how they refuse to admit it.  
>  
>It's  undeniable that society generally ignores male victims of sexual  assault to a considerable extent - many men are not taken seriously when  they report sexual assault, particularly when there is a female  perpetrator. I won't deny that. This is a huge talking point of MRAs  (and oftentimes men in general) and while it is a valid problem to be  outraged about... when it comes to *why* this problem exists, they start spouting bullshit.  
>  
>Can  we just spend a few seconds to wonder why male victims of sexual  assault are mocked? Who are the people mocking them? The short answer  is, 9 out of 10 times, *it's other men*.

That's where op gives a bunch of examples of how men generally say that they're lucky and how they disrespect victim etc etc.

Instead of focusing on why male victims are mocked, they go quickly to blaming men for other men being the reason they're mocked. Because our biggest focus is who's the problem and not why. Men are the problem to their problems, more victim blaming to come.

And they attempt to sympathize with victims but it (unsurprisingly) leads to victim blaming.

>Now if you bluntly ask **men** if they think it's *just as bad*  for a women to do these things to men as men are doing to women, they'd  say, **""Yes, of course! It sucks that society ridicules male victims.""  Yeah, that's** ***precisely because*** ***you people*** ***keep encouraging these actions*****.**  No fucking wonder no one wants to take you seriously when you report  sexual harassment or assault from women. The people who refuse to take  you seriously are, 9 out of 10 times, *men*.

Also op;

>Ask the men on Reddit about how often they get sexually harassed by  women. Ask them about stories of being stalked, groped and violently  pursued by women. You will get some responses here and there detailing  genuine experiences some men have had. Now read the other comments.  Suddenly, you'll see ""I wish that would happen to me just once...""; ""You  guys are lucky""; ""I wouldn't mind if that happened to me - I want to  feel desired!"" **Honestly, these are really fucking rude and untactful  things to say to a survivor of sexual harassment/assault.**

But it's okay if you blame them for getting that kind of unwanted attention. ""It's bad that you should even say that to a survivor of sexual assault, but if they ever say that you shouldn't keep encouraging these actions because you're also a man!!""

Seriously, is victim-blaming even a problem for them at this point?

>I've  yet to encounter a woman who says she does not support these male  victims, saying that ""he probably enjoyed it"" or ""lucky guy"" as a  response to any female-on-male sexual assault stories. I'm sure such  women exist - they absolutely do - but I am confident to assume that  they are *heavily, heavily* outnumbered by the men who hold this same sentiment.

This is their experience on it, while valid, doesn't really bring a firm reason to why we should be directing our attention to one part of the problem when we find it a problem in general that should be solved.

>MRAs  talk about this issue all the time, but proceed to blame feminists,  saying that they are the ones refusing to acknowledge male victims. I'm  genuinely not sure if they legitimately believe that it's feminists, or,  that they *are* aware that it's  mostly men who hold this sentiment, but are just looking for a  scapegoat. The former would mean they are idiotic and completely  ignorant. The latter would mean they are disingenuous and devoid of any  integrity. Neither would surprise me.

In my experience, most MRA's are saying that feminism undermines victims rather than mocks them, and I've seen some feminists pretty much pushing it to the side because god forbid another light is shown it's an attack on them.

Now if you think men are big contributors to the problem, fine. If you think feminists are big contributors to the problem, also fine. There is no definite evidence to determine this so it's your experience on the issue. 

But if we're the big bad wolves for not actively vilifying men for being a big contributor (based on your experience), then your form of activism will achieve nothing.

# TLDR;

OP: MRA's refuse to acknowledge most people who make fun of sexual assault victims are (I'm assuming) men. They're such hypocrites. Problems men face are from men and if you don't want it you shouldn't be encouraging it. I barely see women or feminists do it lol it's disingenuous to think they would because my experience is the norm.

You'd have to be a literal barnacle to think MRA's or male sexual assault victims are encouraging it, and stop victim blaming.

We don't care who is normally the bigger problem because it's a problem, so us not acknowledging it is not being hypocritical because its based on our experience in the first place. If we think feminists are a big problem then we've experienced such from feminists, and if you think men that's fine but don't shove your experience down our throats.

1424366217.0,Guys we need to focus more on traditionalism.,"Hi guys we need to have a talk. [Flips chair around to start a rapping session circa 1980's]

Listen we all know that feminism is at it core evil and gets less evil the further out you go with more use idiot between the core and you. This is fact. it will be true tomorrow it will be true the day after tomorrow, and the day after that and the day after that. the good news is it is dying, we have hit peak feminism. people are sick of it. Full stop.

We need to stop talking so much about it, because it is distracting US from two larger issues. Traditional(ism) (Conservatism), and gynocentrism which also feeds feminism. These issues are the two biggest issues we face at the moment. Right now feminism is doing a better job fight gynocentrism than us, also it doing a better job fighting it self than we are too. 

How are feminists doing a better job fighting gynocentrism you ask? How stridently do feminist push to get women into the work force? They do it pretty hard don't they? What do we do? I see more MRA arguing for a traditional female roles (SAHM) than we do. How often do we loudly and publicly say fuck you it 2015 get a job and work the time of SAHMs has past. Feminist are pushing to get women in to combat roles. What we saying? no they should why? because they can't huck a 70 lbs ruck? Fuck that let the carry 50 lbs ruck and don't tell me a woman can't carry 50 pounds on there back. We are telling women no your not cut for xyz job. fuck that if a few die or get hurt well last i checked men die and get hurt on the job a lot too. 

Why? traditionalism. it needs to die. it need to die here first or the movement is forfeit. I would be too easy for the MRM to fall into traditionalism,and if you listen to MGTOW like RBK than it might already be heading in that direction.

This means pissing off female supporters. This isn't a bad thing, they aren't pro-male they are promale slavery. if your slave master has pussy is she any less a slave master?

But don't rest on you lorals because while we are killing traditionalism  we need to start getting science and research done on gynocentrism. that is our final boss.

We need to get research looking in to biases favoring females. This needs to happen.

Also just keep in mind feminism at least right now is shooting it self in the cunt repeatedly.  We really don't add much if we ever added any thing at all, and our time and expertise is better spent killing traditionalism and gynocentrism a problem which the wider society isn't looking at and doesn't know to look at.

1281456142.0,Vasectomy can lead to castration,"From: http://dontfixit.org/forum/posts/030630.htm

From: C.J.
Date: 6-15-03
Subject: Vasectomy leads to castration

I would like to relate a tale of utter horror I have gone through with my vasectomy. In June of 2002 I had a vasectomy performed. Right away there were complications, namely an infection that spread to my testicles. After 3 rounds of antibiotics, my general practitioner referred me to a urologist who informed me that I needed a dual orchiectomy, in essence making me a eunuch. My wife was rather concerned about this procedure, but after 5 separate second consultations I knew I had to have the operation. The antibiotics had failed and I was in severe pain and had massive swelling in my testicles and scrotum.

The orchiectomy was performed and the pain and swelling subsided within a week. Now I was faced with the fact that I had to live my life as a eunuch and had some psychological problems to deal with. Months of counseling helped, but there was one more insult to add to my injury. My wife told me she wanted another child. We have 2 wonderful kids already. This reversal of her decision caused me to become very angry and resentful of her because of the shared decision we had made for me to get a vasectomy.

My wife informed me that she wanted to adopt another child, I told her NO, since I had become a eunuch and had to wear testosterone patches, she would not get to adopt a child. She had her chance to have another child when I was still fully functional. As you would expect, this has caused friction in the relationship, but too damn bad! I made the ultimate sacrifice for our relationship and I will have a large say on how our lives will progress.

I used to be a robust man of 6' 5"", 220 lbs. Now I weigh 153 lbs. Quite a change, I think most of it is due to psychological factors, but never the less, I cannot put on muscle mass even though I eat right and work out diligently.

Since the operation I have been non-functional sexually and have erectile dysfunction. Viagra does not do the trick, I need to use that damn Caverject, you know-the tube you have to stick in your penis to squirt the Caverject compound into the urethra.

Sex is actually painful for me now, my wife tries to understand, but she cannot fully understand the physical changes a man goes through when he loses his ""manhood."" I take full responsibility for my actions, I underwent the vasectomy because my wife and I had decided not to have anymore children. It was also a shared decision as man and wife. To this day she is reluctant to accept any responsibility for her part in the decision process. I understand her: She cannot accept the fact that she played decision role in my mutilation.

The final insult to this nightmare happened on my 35th birthday. I had just come from an appointment at my urologist for a 90 day post-op checkup. My wife had a planned a birthday party for me, I arrived and was talking with my friends and having a good time, suddenly I felt some something warm trickling down my leg, I had urinated on myself. There was no urge to go to the bathroom; it just happened. I was highly embarrassed by this situation. While I went to the bedroom to change clothes, my wife actually told some of our friends that I had a botched vasectomy and had another operation to remove my testicles.

So you now can add incontinence to my medical issues. My friends never looked at me the same again after my wife told them my complete shame as an ex-man. That night I packed my stuff and moved out, I told my wife I could not put up with her intentional breach of my personal privacy.

My urologist thinks that there is some residual nerve damage from the operation. I am now on three different medications for incontinence, loss of testosterone (the patch), Xanax, and Procain tablets.

As it stands now, I have reconciled with my wife. I needed her to accept her role in what had happened to me, and through counseling she finally accepted her role in the nightmare. I laid down some fairly tough needs and desires that had to be met by her if our relationship was to stay alive. I would not compromise on several key relationship issues: It was a ""take it or leave it"" situation.

To all men thinking about a vasectomy: DON'T DO IT! Condoms are much cheaper than your manhood. If your wife or girlfriend's pressure you to have a vasectomy, tell them to have a radical mastectomy and have them think how they would feel afterward.

There is a HUGE push for girls/young women to get involved in male dominated fields like sciences and sports management BUT there is virtually NO PUSH AT ALL to get men into female dominated industries i.e Education, nursing and social sciences.

We are pushing so hard to get females to break their gender stereotypes and teaching them to dream big yet we are effectively ignoring the needs of the countless boys who don't receive this specific brand of encouragement that is unique to females... And yet we still turn around wonder why we have so many boys failing and underperforming in our education system. The sad truth is that, throughout their whole lives, they have been systematically conditioned to think that they should just be HAPPY with what they've got and with the position that has been afforded to them; that they aren't worthy of encouragement of support since being male is enough of an advantage and that they should be able to make it on their own.

This isn't to be misconstrued as an attempt to dismiss the trials and tribulations associated with being a woman... It is still DEFINITELY harder to be a woman than to be a man, even in todays society. But I seriously think we need to reassess the way we are bringing the new generation into a progressively equalist society, because the way it is going at the moment I am horribly afraid we are leaving our young boys behind.

1313772433.0,It's not enough to just not feed the trolls,"Recently, a [suspiciously new account](http://www.reddit.com/user/FeministControl) posted a link to an [interview with a feminist mohel](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/jl2zw/feminist_mohel_on_male_genital_mutilation_when_i/).

Now, I understand male genital mutilation is a major men's rights issue for many of you.  It's not an issue that I particular advocate for myself, but that's not to say that I'm for it, and that I don't denounce it, given the chance.  I felt some of the attacks in the comments for this post were unfair, and said so, and I expected to be met with disagreement, even downvotes.

What I did not expect was the rampant accusations of being a feminist myself.  Not just a feminist, but a [""stupid feminist""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/jl2zw/feminist_mohel_on_male_genital_mutilation_when_i/c2d7aya) and even a [""stealth feminist troll""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/jl2zw/feminist_mohel_on_male_genital_mutilation_when_i/c2de0sd).

Those of you who have been here longer than 3 days (FeministControl) or 1 month (peaceknight) have seen my comments here, in TwoX, in feminisms, and feminism.  You may disagree with me, but you know I'm neither troll, nor feminist.  So the only thing I can conclude is that these guys are trolls, and are being upvoted by trolls.  I'm not telling you how to run your movement, but if you let the trolls continue to encroach, you're going to start losing supporters.  Not that people will change their minds on issues, but they'll drift away from forums like /r/mensrights.

I know you guys have been dealing with trolls from the beginning, so maybe you already have a good handle on this.  I just wanted to bring some attention to what I see as a particularly insidious brand of trolling before it gets any bigger.

Edit:  Just to be 100% clear, I'm not concerned with the disagreement.  Disagreement and debate are healthy and necessary.  I'd prefer it to be more civil, but I can take heat as well as anyone else.  What I find disturbing is the blatant repeated attempts to lie about me and misrepresent me and my comments.  Just because you don't agree with me doesn't mean that I'm a feminist, and, in the thread I linked above, I repeatedly denounced the circumcision, only to have it repeatedly thrown in my face that I was defending, supporting, even advocating for MGM.  In short, either these guys can't read at all, or they're trolls.

Edit #2: I am pleased to say that FeministControl PMed me and after a couple back and forths we have resolved our issues.  I retract any accusations of insincerity or trollishness on his part, and we have resolved to discuss things more civilly in the future.  Cheers to finding common ground!",MensRights
1297080918.0,All these posts about dads getting treated like pedos when they’re out with their kids mostly seem like BS to me.,"I’m a single dad of a 3-year-old girl who is with me about 50% of the time. I have tattoos – full sleeves that extend on to the back of my hand and a back piece that extends up on my neck, along with 2-inch diameter plugs in my ears and a long, scraggly beard. I run a tattoo shop and my truck is completely wrapped in graphics to advertise my business, including classic pin-up art of women with exposed breasts. The name of my shop includes the word ‘Hell’, which is also prominently featured on my truck. I live in a mid-sized, extremely conservative Southern city.
 
I have never, ever, ever been looked at askance, much less accused of pedophilia directly or indirectly when out with my daughter and certainly not when purchasing toys or clothes for her, whether she is with me or not. Ever. Even when she is screaming and kicking as I try to strap her into her car seat in my breast-and-swear-word covered truck. Not even when we’ve been at the park during a weekday when the only other adults are stay at home moms in those velvet sweatsuits – you know, the ones who watch lots of Fox news and Nancy Grace. These moms usually smile at me, and sometimes we talk a little bit if our kids are playing together. If it’s true that fathers are always being accused of pedophilia or treated like potential pedophiles, then my scary, ugly, tattooed Southern ass would have experienced it at least once or twice. I haven’t, and neither have any of my scruffy, tattooed buddies who have their own kids. Basically, I think y’all are a bunch of fantasists who enjoy making this shit up for sympathy or entertainment. Maybe not 100% of you. But most of you.
 
You know what reaction I do get that bugs the shit out of me? I hate it when people act like I’m doing something unusual or special by parenting my child. Her mother (who is 29 but looks about 17, and has plenty of her own tattoos)  is the one who gets shit in public. She’s the one who the other moms avoid at the park and she’s the one who gets dirty looks when our daughter throws a tantrum in the parking lot. Single moms get disrespected and treated like shit. My ex, who is a full-time college student surviving on student loans, and who takes no child support from me even though I make a good income, regularly had grocery cashiers and other customers make terrible comments when she used her WIC allowance to buy food when our daughter was small (we broke up before she was born, but were and are still on friendly terms).  It upset her so much that I convinced her to throw the WIC card away and let me help her out with groceries for a while. All the while, when I was out with the baby, I was getting smiled at by everyone and congratulated on being such a good dad by total strangers.
 
Dads, even the ones who may only have their kids for one day out of 30, are treated like heroes when they’re with their kids. Single moms, who often raise their children with little or no help, are treated like shit. Yes, I know men get the shitty end of the stick in lots of areas, but this right here ain’t one of them.  If you can’t see this, or if you are pretending not to see it, you care more about your agenda or about telling a good story than about the truth. Or maybe you’re looking for this kind of thing. The woman scowling at you at the grocery store is thinking about how her back hurts or whatever and is actually just staring through you, not at you. The cashier who is giving you “dirty looks” for buying your daughter some underpants is just having a shitty day or is a shitty person in general. Seriously, no one cares about you that much.
 
As a dad who has 50/50 custody of my daughter, and who had to fight for it, I’m all for the reform of family courts to  be more fair to fathers. As a man who was once falsely accused of rape (which didn’t go very far, thank god) I am all for reforming laws around rape prosecution. That’s why I’ve lurked on Men’s Rights for so long. But as a sensible fucking person who cares about the truth, I think this ‘dads-get-treated-like-pedophiles’  crap needs to stop. It’s just as much of a bullshit myth as date-rape-drugs and stranger danger. Like both of those things, it may happen. Very, very rarely. And it’s terrible when it does. But there’s no way it happens as much as this subreddit would lead you to believe.",MensRights
1250595257.0,A boy becomes a man.,"Just wanted to relate a little anecdote about what my nasty divorce did to me and how I've changed. 

I used to be the sort of guy that was very chivalrous. I would never even think of not opening a door for a woman. I was the kind of man a woman could really count on.

So anyway few days ago I was in the grocery store and there was a very beautiful girl there. She saw me checking her out and smiled. I smiled back and that was that. I have a girlfriend and I think cheaters are the lowest form of human life. So I forgot about the hot chic and went back to my grocery situation.

So anyway I was on my way out and she was behind me coming out of the store. I let the door go as I was walking out and apparently she wasn't watching and it smacked her in the face. I didn't sling the door or anything it was pneumatic and so I couldn't anyway. 

Next thing I know, she says,

""You asshole! Why didn't you hold the door?"" 

And I just turned around and kind of laughed and said, ""chivalry is dead.. you bitches did not watch where you were going with feminism and now you better watch were your going when you come out of the grocery store!"" 

I walked off laughing and instead of feeling guilty I kind of smiled inside and have this warm glow heh.. I still do. I told this story to my brother and he added, ""she probably went home wanting you after that."" 

Whatever power the bitches have had over me all of my life is finally broken. I'm a free man.

1679531796.0,I've become pro-life because pro-choicers are hypocrites.,"Pro-choice people support a woman's right to have an abortion even if the man is against it. Your body, your choice.

But most of them oppose a man's right to get a paper abortion. They don't support financial autonomy even though it doesn't infringe on the bodily autonomy of the woman.

If you can have bodily autonomy, why can't I have financial autonomy? They arent mutually exclusive you know? If I was raped and the woman rapist decided to not have an abortion, why should I be enslaved to her child for 18 years?

They keep saying, ""If you didn't want to pay child support, you shouldn't have had sex.""

So now my position is the same for them. ""If you didn't want to get pregnant, you shouldn't have had sex.""

In conclusion, this is why I now support pro-lifers. Because at least they believe in equality. No one has autonomy from the child in any form. They are logically consistent and wont make pro choice arguments because of their bigotry towards the other gender. They hold both men and women accountable to the child and are not hypocritical losers like the majority of pro-choicers. This is also why I was overjoyed when roe v wade got turned down, because now we are actually one step closer to gender equality. Also giving only one sex the ability to choose to be a parent creates a HUGE power dynamic between the two sexes, where women can blackmail men into being fathers and put them in a vulnerable position. Now they cant.A world where neither sex can get the choice to be a parent is much better than if only one sex can have that choice.

I just had to get this out of my chest,fuck all of you misandrist pro choicers who hold double standards for no reason other than your hate for men.

sincerely, a former pro choice

1306802856.0,"I wish when I was younger that someone had set me down and had a heart to heart talk about all the ugly truths of life, so I am leaving this here for any young people who care to read it.","I imagine most here on reddit are still very young and naive college students,  as such you probably are very idealistic and optimistic about the world you live in.   I used to be the same way, but old age and reality changed me.   

I am going to talk about all the ugly truths I've learned in my old age,  I sincerely hope it helps someone.

Sit yourself down and really consider if you wish to have children or not. Consider how much of your money, time and very soul you will have to give your family.  If you decide to have children realize that you will be a slave for the next 20-25 years to provide for your family, and you won't be able to do anything you want except work and grow old.  Every friend I have had who was a family man, slowly died inside over the years.   In my opinion unless you are rich already having a family isn't something you are going to enjoy.  

If you decide you do not want a family, and you are certain go have a vasectomy, NOW.  You have no idea how many times I have as a sterile man have been falsely told, I impregnated a woman.  This is a common tactic used by women, if they weren’t pregnant when they told you they were, they will get that way in a hurry afterwords.

Do not ever disclose your sterility status to a woman,  simply tell them upfront you never want children.   Women are repulsed by the idea of a sterile man, even if it is at a deep subconscious level.

Women do sleep around, probably more so than men and they do bring home std's. Find a women who is tight enough to get you off with a condom and always wear one, even if she insists it's ok. If you take one piece of advice from all of this make it this one.  Just because she didn't have an std at the start of the relationship doesn't mean she won't bring one home to you. 

Most women absolutely require a man to provide financial, mental and emotional stability.  Sit down and really ask yourself if the sex is worth it.  All the time, money and energy, and sanity you will have to pour into a relationship to make it work,  it is a lot larger than you would imagine.   Is the sex really worth it?

Most women require you to dominate and lead the relationship like a father figure, but in a subtle and gentle way.  Always playing the lead role in a relationship is very draining or at least it has been for me, but it is absolutely necessary for a healthy relationship.  The times I’ve tried to have a 50/50 relationship it always failed miserably.  Women are not happy unless they are dominated by a male in the relationship.

Women lie, cheat and steal with a straight face.  They are absolute masters of deception and manipulation.   You know how you look at a woman's body and desire to have sex with her,  women feel that way about your money.  They will do whatever it takes to get you to marry them and that does include intentionally getting pregnant without your consent.  Remember that women are biologically wired to make babies and feel the urge to do so stronger than our urge to have sex,  this is especially true as they get into their 30's. 

Relationships are really more like war zones than they are anything else,  if you are in a relationship with a woman you can always expect constant drama.  You have to fight and show your back bone and dominate them into submission or they will continue this behavior.  Don’t put up with it, but never hit a woman either.   If you are unable to stop her from causing constant problems and drama, after several months you must absolutely evict her from your house and your life.

Almost all women are absolutely bat shit insane, but they hide that fact until you are married.  You think you know crazy?  You haven't seen shit.    No really, you haven’t seen shit. Never get married, unless you are doing it to start a family. 

Women do not think like we do, logically and rationally.  They think with their emotions.  If they get some crazy idea in their head, there is no convincing them otherwise.  Women have no sense of responsibility for their actions.   Women can get away nearly with anything, and frequently do.  Frankly women don't give a shit about whose lives or property they destroy in their never ending quest for drama.  Most women I've been with and I've been with several during my lifetime,  are borderline psychopaths.

Women will eat you alive if you allow them to do so.  If you stand firm in the relationship fighting is inevitable and even required to keep the relationship healthy.  You must make it clear that it is your way or they can get the fuck out.  


As I’ve gotten older and my sex drive has diminished I’ve found I am happier alone.  The amount of energy that goes into making a relationship work is absolutely staggering, and I can’t believe I spent most of my youth spending my time and money and sanity on something as trivial as sex.

If you cannot live without sex, find a nice girl you can pay to have sex with you, trust me.  It is cheaper in the long run, and less stress and bullshit as well.   If you cannot live without companionship get a cat, dog and or good friend as a roommate.   Women will ruin your life in ways you can’t even begin to imagine.


Moving on.    Almost everything you are told by the media or other people in this society is bullshit.  Everything you hear on the TV, everything you read in the newspapers.  It’s all bullshit. This whole society is fucking retarded and insane.  Almost no one is competent to perform their job,  if you want something done correctly you really do have to do it yourself.   This whole society is fucked up beyond all recognition.    Watch that movie idiocracy about 5 times and realize we are there now.

If you have a problem, it is solely your responsibility to research it and solve it yourself.  It is up to you to educate yourself and fix your own problems.  Do not trust medical doctors to be competent, do not trust lawyers to be competent, do not trust mechanics, plumbers or anyone helping you do anything or with any problem to have any fucking clue what they are doing or really care about anything other than obtaining your money. 

The rich and powerful and special interests run this country,  they care only about exploiting you to their own personal gain.  If the rich knew they could get away with grinding the poor into fucking hamburger for a profit they would do so absolutely without any doubt.

Go into a career that pays decently and is low stress,  I know everyone says to do what you love, but a low stress decent paying career should be your biggest priority.  If what you love won’t pay the bills or involves you being in a high stress environment, forget about it.


Enjoy nature, enjoy good food, enjoy friends and family.  You can be happy with incredibly little, and when I say that I mean it.  You don’t need anything but the basics for life to be happy.   In fact I’ve found I am happier now living in a camper earning less than $800 per month than I ever was working all the time to buy more shit I didn’t need, or giving it to women who would just piss it down the drain with nothing to show for it.",MensRights

1703075789.0,Transwomen In Women's Sports Shouldn't Concern Men,"It has been for a long time a discussion whether transwomen (biological men) should be allowed into women's sports. Most women, at least the ones that do play sports, are against the idea of letting transwomen play women's sports claiming they have a physical advantage and the topic has become so heated that it has reached the mainstream media with several political commentators criticizing the move.

However, none of this should concern men. Because the reverse has been happening for decades and no one gave a crap.

Take for instance,

**Women-Only Jobs / Diversity Hiring -** Several STEM companies specifically hire only women even if they are not qualified, meaning a qualified man loses a job. But no one gives a crap about this, nor has it been a topic of discussion in the mainstream. White men or men in general have actively been discriminated against in the hiring process. Some companies even track the percentage of women being hired each year in their company and think it's empowerment.

**Scholarships For Women -**
Colleges and organisations in the West give out scholarships only for women, even though most college graduates in the West are women. Again, Asian and White men face discrimination in the process and Ivy League institutions like Harvard maintain a 50% women ratio in the admission process. 

*""But bro, women are oppressed!""* Sure, even though governments and societies largely favor women women have had the same rights as men since the 70's or 80's. We'd be living in the most technologically advanced world and have women dominate every field there is in the future, but feminists will still find a way to complain about oppression. 

**Women-Only trains and busses -**
Countries have trains and busses only for women and when men demand the same, they are hit with the ""women are most likely to get attacked, so they deserve that"" response. Okay? I can assume in any given country that men contribute to the majority of the taxpayer fund and I'd be right every time. All men have to pay for the actions of some, if you want safety you pay for it separately. 

Even if that wasn't the case, men are more likely to end up in poverty or be homeless, but countries have set up more homeless shelters for women compared to men and they have more schemes to get women out of poverty, even though men are *more* likely to be victims of this. What's your argument for that?

**Women's Sports being funded by Men's Sports -**
The WNBA operates on a loss and is largely funded by the NBA. So the money men make is snatched and given to women. But still, feminists complain about ""equal pay"" as if the NBA is not a business that pays out money to its athletes only by the amount of money it has generated. The WNBA gives out a larger percentage of the generated money to its women's athletes compared to the NBA, but people turn a blind eye to this and no one complains about this daylight robbery.

**Affirmative Action in the office -**
Countries like India have made a bill where 33% of people in the parliament have to be women. And people blindly support this nonsense in the name of ""women empowerment"". If women were equal to men, you'd achieve everything by your ability and not depend on affirmative action to ""succeed"". 

Not only that, but some states in India have schemes where they give out money to women. And again, since Indians value women more than men, they support this in the name of ""women empowerment"". I fail to see how getting freebies amounts to empowerment.

And other instances like when a war happens, **only men** are conscripted to fight for the lives of women, but still, the media reports only on ""women and children"" and makes it seem like they are the ones that are the most affected, even though their male counterparts are not only ignored but are also forced to lose their lives for these women. 

None of these issues are mainstream. Men have to lose their jobs, their money and their lives for these women but feminists will still find a way to justify all of this crap.

But as soon as transwomen get into women's sports, the issue turns political with many calling it ""men invading women's sports"". The reverse has been happening on a larger scale everywhere and none of them gave a crap about it. No man should ever care about transwomen being in women's sports.

1624721408.0,Australia's 30 second rapist vs MensRights 10 second rapist?,"Australia had a famous case of rape back in 1986 called the 30 second rapist.

https://mensrights.com.au/false-allegations/feminist-influence-in-the-courts-the-diabolical-episode-of-the-30-second-rapist/

A man was convicted of rape because the woman said that during sex she told him to stop but said he carried on for about 30 seconds before pulling out.  On that basis because of recent changes in the law pushed by feminists which made it irrelevant that they had consensual sex initially or that no force or threats were used, the man faced 15 years in prison.  At the time MRAs were united in condemning the massive expansion of the definition of sex to include trivial or even ""zero bad"" examples of what had been considered rape.

Many pointed out (including me) that under the new feminist laws being lobbied for across the world a woman waking her husband up with a blow job on his birth day was a rapist, and because the laws often came with minimum sentencing guidelines she would have to be sentenced to a considerable time in prison.  It was taken for granted that these new definitions of rape were abusive and intended to attack men.  The laws about two people getting drunk and having sex making the man (never the woman) a rapist were mocked by asking ""if two drunk Lesbians have sex which one is the rapist?  or do they both rape each other?""

But these days it seems like the modern MRAs, have wholesale adopted these draconian definitions of rape, and only want to see the same idiocy inflicted on women as was inflicted upon men.  Now we have this board's equivalent of the 30 second rapist.  A woman who is I suppose a ten second rapist according to all the people who downvoted me?  

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/o80ipp/was_i_raped/

Now my reply here started out by saying feminists would call the case rape, but I said, ""**I don't think you have to think of it as rape**"".

That was too much for many MRAs who have obviously taken on the role of feminist for the other side somehow.  They had to attack me for suggesting to the guy that maybe it wasn't the healthiest response to the situation.  Because massively expanding the definition of rape to include stupid shit hasn't exactly worked out too well for women has it?  It's worked out great for feminists, but not for the women.  It's not healthy to nurse a grudge and be a victim all your life.  It's not healthy to go around calling yourself a ""survivor"" and fixing your life identity around one dumb event all your life.  The fact is that while we point out the difference between men and women when it comes to labelling themselves as victims of events for the purposes of pointing out that male victims are undercounted relative to female.... the men have it right and the women have it wrong.  The women should adopt the healthier approach of male ""denial"" if you like.  It's not healthy to pump up events from the past.

If you're a victim of either sex in this sort of situation I don't think it's a good idea to turn the victim meter up to ten and live in that past.  

The feminists changed all these laws a few decades ago.  The law might currently say waking your husband with a blow job makes you a rapist now, but it never used to.  Have we lost sight of the fact that it's the current state of affairs that is fucked up?  Deliberately fucked up a few decades ago by feminists with the direct goal of screwing over men?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As per the link above the 30 second rapist after serving his time was ruined and committed suicide.  The two women who acted as witnesses against him were later proven to have lied and were themselves convicted (for a much shorter period).  They'd noted the change in the law and decided they could use the changes to falsely convict the man.   And they were proven right.",MensRights
1361148544.0,Is /r/mr's fear of marriage akin to some femenists irrational fear of rape?,"I am completely honest in asking this. I have a wonderful girlfriend whom I love dearly and would like to marry assuming things continue to be great over the next few years. I know that ramifications for divorce are currently very high for men, in particular in the US. But I wonder if this subreddit is a little too paranoid about the consequences of marriage. 

IMHO, it isn't much different than the irrational fear of being raped, which is almost promoted and spread by some in the feminist movement. Does anyone else think /r/mensrights irrationally spreads fear of personal and financial ruin from a divorce, so much as to discourage marriage in the first place?

**edit** I am still getting responses to this, so let me be clear. I am NOT comparing rape and divorce as comparable things.

Here are points that I feel are the advantages to dating other men:

* They acknowledge that they have the ability to defend themselves and therefore do not use you as a meat-shield if a situation arises. Most women do this if anything pops out, so this is self-demeaning as they choose to remain child-like and refuse to defend themselves.

* They are better in bed.

* They do not expect you to follow sexist gender roles and generally don't have you pay for them. They split shit 50/50.

* They take responsibility for their actions and do not blame their problems on you.

* They don't give you shit about ""being a real man"" whatever that fucking means.

* They do not always expect you to initiate. They are straight-forward. If they like you, they say so. Rather than saying, ""I'm a woman, men should come to me."" (Btw, I don't get that. If you wait around to be asked out all the time, you are getting what's given to you, not what you actually want. So again, self-demeaning.)

* I talk to them and do not feel like I need to avoid coming off as a ""creep."" That's a personal issue, but some others may agree.

Her: We need to discuss the work done around the house. I feel like I am doing everything.

Before I continue, I think I should add some information about our current situation.

Our family has three sources of income. ALL of which are the result of my working outside the home. I get two different pensions, one from my last job, one from CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and the 3rd source is me still working 40+ hours a week. I have worked and earned money all my marriage (35+ years), and I am 60+ years old. My wife worked for approximately seven years of our 35+ years of marriage. We have two kids, both over the age of 25.

Now to continue:

Me: Yes, you probably do all the work around the house except for the cooking and dishes, as I do almost all the cooking when I get off work and do the dishes right after supper. 

Her: yes, you do some of the work like that, but I do all the rest.

No: Ok, so how many hours a week does it take you to do all that work?

Her: A lot more than 40 hours, that's for sure.

Me: Really, how so..You do about three loads of laundry per week, which is about an hour of work in total. What other work do you do that takes up so much of your time?

Her: Laundry takes A LOT longer than an hour per week; it's about 1 1/2 hours per load.

Me: Excuse me, how in gods name does it take you 1 1/2 hours to do a load of laundry? It takes 5 mins to load the washer, 1 min to switch it to the dryer and a few mins to unload and fold out of the dryer.

Her: What about the fact it takes 1/2 to wash it and 1 hour to dry it?

Me: That isn't YOU doing it; that's the machine. A machine btw that I worked and paid for, so if anyone should get credit for the work the machine does, it should be me.

Her: Oh, so that's how it's going to go, right?

Me: It's not; I am walking away from this conversation now; I see you are going to grossly overpad the hours you work.

1339009931.0,Are feminist claims of sexism just projections based on an underlying belief in the superiority of men?,"We all know of the double standards that are applied to various employment contexts: when a woman exceeds over a man in a particular industry, it's because she's worked hard than they have or is smarter than they are, but when a man exceeds over a woman (as is far more often the case), it's because of sexism and discrimination.  The cognitive dissonance in these different standards is almost unbelievable, but I wonder whether they are merely symptoms of an underlying pathology.

Most of the people at the top of any particular field are men, which is in accordance with the different bell curves that apply to men and women in terms of IQ--men are more likely to be either brilliant or stupid while women are more likely to be average.  Perhaps this fact has shaped the beliefs of feminists in subtle ways.  Perhaps they believe that men really are better than women in any given area; obviously men are more capable in any field that is physically demanding, but they seem to dominant in the mentally demanding fields as well.

If it is the case that feminists hold an underlying belief that men are inherently superior to women, then they would be more likely to see sexism in every walk of life because it seems rational to them.  In other words, when a feminist sees a situation where a man is promoted or hired over a woman, she would think ""well, I think that men are better than women, so if I were trying to run a purely efficient and productive business, I'd promote or hire a man before I'd promote or hire a woman.  Therefore, it makes perfect sense that this particular employer in this particular case would do the same.  Why wouldn't they?""

I have followed this subreddit and it is one of my favourites. But I never got why lots of men’s right activists vote left. I do shift often between libertarian to conservative, but never in my life could I ever vote for the left. They support feminism, and do not care for men at all, make us feel like the victims and belittle masculinity and strong men. They assume we are the problem, that we all rape and harass and abuse ‘innocent women’ and it is disgusting to me. 

Every time I see libertarian and conservative policies and issues it address. It doesn’t vilify me all as a man. Given I am a Christian too and stick by the Bible as well, which not everyone here is either, I still see lots of hate towards men from the left. Like I can’t understand how people who support mens rights vote in the same line as feminists in politics, like it is not gonna achieve anything voting in the same line as the enemy, it will keep enabling the problem and it doesn’t seem you really are serious about change.

Honestly I never had a big emphasis on big government either, it feels like every problem, they try and ‘fix’, which ends up making it worse. The political left typically prefers bigger government and more government spending, while on the right they want smaller government and people to be more free. That’s where I believe where men thrive, with no restraints and control, and can be their own man, without being contolled and bossed around what to do by the elite.

Feminists seem to overwhelmingly be socialists, wanting the government to step in all the time to help them get their way, they advocate for laws that hurt men, and the left leaning governments do side with women as that is majority of their supporters base, hence they write and pass laws that unfortunately hurt us men. The definition of rape and harassment always changes, we don’t trust being around women anymore, it is truly sickening.

I also have a strong emphasis on traditional values, that the husband leads the household, and the wife is feminine and submissive, and it feels like lots of men react to feminism and don’t trust and hate women completely and don’t want to be with them anymore, which I disagree with. Women and Men are meant to be together, we are designed to be, to ignore that is foolish. We compliment one another and having a family is a beautiful thing, and the left doesn’t want people to be married anymore and dividing us instead, making both sexes distrust and hate each other. Women can no longer be stay at home mothers and raise families, they have to work and be taxed by the government and has became a tool of the state.

I agree marriage laws favour women and that is a problem and I am against that, but voting for the left won’t fix that as they side with women and believe them all the time, even when they are wrong. I feel like if we encouraged smaller government, and allowed more freedom for people, we are able to live our lives authentically without control. Restoring power to the people is important to me, and I believe we achieve more by working together and fixing the divide for men against women. And I believe that the left keeps encouraging it, sure I may sound hypocritical saying I want to fix the divide when I only believe conservatism is the only way, but I have tried many times to sympathise with leftists, and the are all toxic, give me death threats, hate and silence me. They refuse to listen to me and that is why I believe that giving them an inch, will make them kill and destroy us.

Please try and answer me and correct me where I am wrong, I will be happy to listen and talk about your points and do my best to be respectful. I am only talking through this from my point of view, and I know I should converse with people that are happy to listen and talk to me.

First off I want to say fully support the legal rights issues to a degree, for things like divorce and custody there should be an unbiased and equal number of men and women on a jury. I won’t go into detail but I will say I have your guys backs on that issue. 

Secondly I fully support the false accusations thing you are all against as we all should be, about 4 years ago when I was in school and a girl falsely accused me of plotting to shoot up the school because i was “in love” with her. Society still has a bias towards girls in social issues with guys, and I think it needs to be complete equal power and protection by the law for false accusations, I almost had it put on my record. However I think there needs to be an investigation to see if there is even evidence to have a trial and it should be held secret as to not defame either person before proven innocent or guilty.

Now I’m gonna do a brief explanation of my views on other issues. 

I don’t believe education and employment opportunities are unequal for men and it seems that way now but it will equal out someday, the idea is they’re trying to diversify workforce and education.

I also don’t really see where there’s a difference in health.

I also don’t really see what’s wrong with feminism, if you ask me I’m a guy who grew up with a single mother and no father. I agree some feminists can be stupid, but there are actual non-nutty ones fighting for legit causes.

1414508917.0,On the subject of female teachers banging male students...,"I'm sure I'm going to catch some flak and downvotes for the little rant I'm about to get off my chest here, but goddamn do I *hate* reading about female teachers having sex with male students on this subreddit. Why? Because it seems like most of the commenters, in their understandable hysteria for men to be treated fairly, want it to *not* be assumed that the boy enjoyed it and presumptively treated like a victim. 

And you know what? That's fucking stupid. 

Men are not like women. And that's fucking okay. We don't have to adopt ill-fitting female attitudes about shit in some broken attempt to make things ""fair."" Maybe the rest of you do, but I don't want to live in a world where the politically correct *lie* that men and women are exactly the same except for the plumbing is considered the truth. Sexual dimorphism exists in our behavior. 

And you know what? The vast majority--I mean the *vast* majority--of teenage boys who fucked their teachers weren't victims and enjoyed the fuck out of it. We are much, much, much less likely to be victimized by this kind of situation due to our differing natures. 

Should the law treat men and women equal here? Absolutely. Should a teenage boy who *does* feel victimized be taken as seriously as a girl? Absolutely. 

But can we please stop fucking pretending that all these teenage boys are definitely victims and that we should automatically treat them all as victims? That's simply trying to extend the sexist and wrong-headed way society white knights for women to men. 

How about instead we extend the reasonable way society treats teenage boys who willingly and enjoyingly have sex with women to teenage girls who do the *same goddamn thing* with men unless there's actual evidence of victimization beyond the sex act itself? 

Should teachers be allowed to fuck students? Of course not--fire them and ban them from teaching. Should it be illegal? Probably, but a goddamn misdemeanor at worst unless there's coercion, in which case kick it up to felony. 

The MRM seems to have it completely ass backwards on this. It's not the way society treats teenage boys in this regard that's wrong, which is having some amount agency in their decision to have sexual intercourse. It's the way it treats teenage girls, which is that they can't possibly have any.  ",MensRights

The third link also provides evidence that circumcision increases the rate of violence, rape, suicide, and murder, though not as a direct result of PTSD; so, it would seem to me that circumcision shouldn't just be the MRHM's number one issue, it should be the number one issue for feminists, and anyone who claims to want to improve society.",MensRights

1393481359.0,Something I want to get off my chest and discuss that's controversial enough I felt the need to make a throwaway.,"So, last week in my community, a little girl was abducted by a stranger, raped, and murdered.  Pretty much the most god awful thing you can imagine. The guy was seen abducting her and caught a day later, but unfortunately it was too late.

The community has rallied like crazy behind the family.  It's really been amazing.  And, in my opinion, that's exactly what should happen when something like this happens to a child.  I have children myself, a boy and a girl.  I can't even imagine.

However...  I feel like an asshole for even having this thought and this is the only place I'd feel comfortable discussing it at all (even my wife disagrees with me on this)...

But I just can't shake the idea that if it had been a little boy that had been abducted and raped and murdered, that there wouldn't be this same outpouring of support.

I think there would be some.  A lot, even.  I'm not sure how much.  

But the same?  No.  I can't see there being a 10,000 person candlelight vigil if it was a boy.  I can't see hundreds of people wearing the boy's favorite colors to work in honor of him.  I can't see people standing outside the courthouse with signs.  I can't see the Westboro Baptist Church threatening to show up at his funeral because of all the media attention.

Again, I'm not trying to criticize or tear down the amazing support the community has shown.  That is EXACTLY what should've happened.

I just can't help thinking it wouldn't have happened for a boy.  Am I wrong?  Tell me if I'm wrong.",MensRights

Not a problem. The issue I had was she was wearing a low cut shirt that showed off lots of cleavage and by the way they move you could tell they were a nice set to play with given a chance. I am happily married with a well endowed woman myself but flaunting these made it very hard to look at her and not her breasts. 

What I don't get is if I was to look not leer or stare I would be the one in the wrong not her for clearly putting them on display.

1684333671.0,"""Dead-Beat Dads"" is a myth...."," A long time ago, I copied something I found online. It's an essay called **Why society completely misunderstands ‘checked-out dads’**. The author was listed simply as ""John G"". I wish I could give proper credit; it's worth a read. If you're in rush, skip down to the paragraph that starts with **a crossroads with four paths**.

From my own experiences, I believe it’s wide-spread for women to use children as a weapon to exact revenge against the ex during, and after, divorce proceedings.

During my lengthy divorce, my ex-wife claimed I was abusive, that she was ‘afraid for her safety,’ and tried to get ‘supervised visitation.’ None of it worked, because it wasn’t true, and because, as an educated professional I had enough money to spend six figures on an attorney. However, it was still a waste of time and money. Even after the divorce, the games continued. My son was being tutored on what to say to me (did you ever hear a 7-year-old respond ‘I’m not comfortable talking about that’ when asked a question?) and being instructed to call me by my first name and not ‘dad.’ I grew tired of making phone calls that weren’t answered, or of being put on hold and the child not coming to the phone, and of cancelled visits. It was heartbreaking seeing the child slip away from me, little by little.

I went to court on several occasions. There is the assumption that the man will just sit there and take the abuse because he does not want to lose the child. She stuck by the letter of the law, and was able to severely limit my contact with my son by way of orders of protection and maintaining to the courts that he was in ‘danger.’ Of the divorced, professional men that I know, all of them had orders of protection against them by their wives. This is even a problem that is recognized by the courts. Some attorneys go so far as to admit that the ‘afraid for my safety’ issue is part of the ‘gamesmanship of divorce.’

I went from the mindset of being a father to the child, to being reduced to the status of a ‘visiting uncle’ or a ‘Disneyland dad’ allied with thinking all the time like an attorney. I was often worried what would happen if she started to make untrue claims that I had (for example) abused the child. When he fell over and scraped his arm when he was with me, I was advised by my attorney to go to all the trouble of going to the doctor, having the scrape bandaged and so on, just to legally cover myself in case she would claim that it had in fact been intentionally caused. While on the lookout for anything that could be used against me, all the while constantly being told I was a bad person, a bad father, and all my involvement with my son was systematically stripped away. The whole process became a painful sham.

I eventually reached **a crossroads with four paths**. Some men commit suicide because they can’t handle the anguish. Others resort to violence and anger against the ex-wife. The thirds set take the difficult road, and sacrifice years of their happiness, battling on a hopeless battle with the ex, just to maintain some sort of contact with the kids. The fourth way, is to simply give up, and decide that the cost to the child through seeing the conflict, and to oneself, is too high.

I considered all the above paths for a long time and was tempted by more than a few of them. In the end, I walked away from all contact with my child more than two years ago.

After I had calmed down, I tried again and contacted the ex. I had hoped she would have calmed down and would be willing to work with me. But no, she is still the same bitter and vengeful person that she always was. Rather than attempting to discuss things and put things on the right track, she is willing to communicate in writing only. She refuses point blank to let me contact our child. Everything has to go through her.

Some people will say it would be the noblest thing to carry on fighting regardless. ‘I would do anything for my kids!’ they spout. Frankly, I feel that’s very naive and is almost always a view propagated by women. Any father here who has been generously granted a weekend every two weeks knows the feeling when you say goodbye. You’re just getting used to having them around, and they are gone. It’s like having a wound that never heals. Like a band-aid being ripped off over and over. The pain never really went away.

Logically, I have to balance the damage to myself, my life and mental health, the possibility of the conflict damaging the child, against the damage done by my absence.

People who don’t know the situation raise their hands in horror, or pass judgement, assume that this is a choice that is taken lightly and easily. It is not. There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about it. Sometimes I see children in shops that look like my child and find it hard not to break down. Sometimes I can’t take my eyes away. Even the shoes are the same. I don’t like to watch movies with children of that age in them. I had to remove all the photographs that I had of my child and every other item and put them in a box. And that’s where all those emotions are now. In a box, held tightly under control, so that I can try and enjoy some semblance of a normal life. It usually works.

In far too many cases, the father is merely viewed as a source of income. The mother is viewed as the ‘real parent’ who almost always gets physical custody of the child. And once she has the child, she is then almost entirely free of the threat of any consequences. This is a great shame for the children involved who will probably be involved in divorces of their own or be afraid of marriage because they have seen the consequences when they fail.",MensRights
