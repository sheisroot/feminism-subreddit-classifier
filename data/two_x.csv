1709272721.0,I just want him back‚Ä¶,"I just want my ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù back so badly. 

Backstory: Him (24m) and I (24f) started seeing each other casually last year. Everything was amazing, and I fell head over heels in love with him. He was different from my usual type. Flash forward a couple months and after doing the naked tango recklessly (I didn‚Äôt think I could get pregnant, I had secondary infertility) I ended up becoming pregnant with his child. He was very adamant that he didn‚Äôt want it at that point and unfortunately I had to respect that. I didn‚Äôt want to force a baby on a man who wasn‚Äôt ready so against everything I believed in for myself, I dragged my ass to planned parenthood where I was ultimately left alone to have the procedure because he had stuff to do. I ended up going back to his house after the procedure to rest and cry. I was devastated more because he knew I wanted that child and how hard it was on me and he left me alone when I begged him not to. But I continued the relationship. I truly prayed that we would work out but sadly he ended up relapsing. After that we just kinda stopped talking. He deleted me off everything (didn‚Äôt block me tho). I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in 6 months now.

I miss him. I‚Äôm ok most of the time but some nights, when I hear a song we used to listen to together, or when I see a bird or the moon, I think about him. I wonder if he‚Äôs ok, if he ever thinks about me. I still love him. And I know it‚Äôs stupid of me to and I know that I shouldn‚Äôt but I truly believe I‚Äôll never find anyone like him. He had some pretty awful qualities but the good ones outweighed the bad threefold. He checked off all the boxes I didn‚Äôt even know existed. Without him, I just feel lost. I‚Äôve tried doing things to make myself happy and work on myself and recently put myself back out there but unfortunately I find myself comparing everyone to him. And NO ONE could ever be him. Maybe I‚Äôm meant to be alone forever. I don‚Äôt know. But I know if he ever asked me for another chance, I‚Äôd drop whoever I‚Äôm with to be with him again in a heart beat, even if I knew the outcome wasn‚Äôt going to be great because as dumb as this sounds, I‚Äôd take being with him again and receiving the bare minimum over being without him. I truly still love him and I firmly believe I always will. My heart is just so heavy.",TwoXChromosomes

1709267492.0,Even when I'm comfortable my instincts take over ,"So today I was hanging out with my friend ""Mark"" at school. We were waiting on the bus and we actually only see each other on the bus in the afternoons. We were sitting at the cafeteria table across from each other and after about 10 minutes of us talking he reached his hand over to my side and grabbed the edge of the table right next to my arm. Without thinking I instantly moved my arm away and looked at him, he looked away and we didn't talk for about 3 minutes. I became very nervous/scared and also very confused (still am) because I've been knowing this guy for months and I've never once felt uncomfortable around him, if anything I actually feel safe. So the fact that I moved my arm was weird and I didn't even realize I was moving it until after I moved it.

Another time when I was uncomfortable around someone I've always been comfortable around happened yesterday. One of my classes is in the auditorium and I have a poster project to do for another class so I asked my teacher if I can go in the sound booth to work on it and he said yes. I went in there by myself and got to work, about 40 minutes later the teacher who I have a good relationship with (he said I'm his favorite student and he also reminds me of my dad so I feel very comfortable around him) came in the booth and started working on something not too far from me. I instantly became uncomfortable and my heart started beating fast because I realized we're the only ones in the booth, everyone else is in the auditorium. He's stronger and bigger than me so if he wanted to hurt me he could. (My anxiety became so bad I left and went to the bathroom just to get away from him). Idk why but everytime I'm in close proximity with a guy I think about this expect for when I'm around my crushes (Mark & Von), they're the only ones I feel safe around. I've been in close proximity with Von plenty of times and I never once thought he could hurt me. We were even in the sound booth together with the lights off at one point and I still felt safe. One time he grabbed my ankle and tried to force it somewhere (we were playing around) and I STILL FELT SAFE. He's literally the only guy I feel safe around.

But anyways I just wanted to know if anyone else have ever suddenly became very uncomfortable around someone they've always been comfortable around. Did your instincts randomly take over or am I just weird? I feel like reading about men being abusive towards women on here and on Pinterest have put me on such a high alert I psyched myself out.

1709267393.0,I've GOTTA find a way to suppress my sex drive ,"I need to suppress my sex drive but I don't know how

Hey y'all! 
I'm gonna cut straight to it. My boyfriend is AMAZING in the bedroom and it's been a while since we've been able to have sex. (We're both in our mid to late 20s) I'm caring for my bedridden grandma full time and I'm at her bedside 24/7 (and we don't have the $ to hire help) so I'm not able to leave the house to see my bf, and while he's able to come visit me, I'm not able to take him into my room for some alone time as 1) I can't be away from my grandma for more than a few minutes and for the last few weeks have HARDLY seen the inside of my bedroom, and 2) My grandma and I live in a 2br apartment that's crowded with relatives and has thin walls and tbh the sex I've been thinking about would be veryyyy loud. 

Another thing I can't do is masturbate. When I masturbate I can't get off unless fully relaxed, I'm laid on my back, and I'm using a vibrator. So getting off in the shower isn't possible for me. On top of that our only bathroom is in my grandma's room. 

What should I dooooo? I'm thinking about my boyfriend rearranging my guts and bending me into a pretzel so much it's getting hard to focus, and I know it's because it's been a hot minute since I've had any sexual release.

My LDR ex and I have had an on and off relationship for 5 years now, at this point, we have spent more time apart than together.
The first time we broke up, it was because for almost a year, he wasn‚Äôt making any efforts to come visit me, I was the only one travelling to see him (I did about 4 times before we broke up) instead he was spending time with his new female friends he made (I‚Äôm 95% sure it was platonic). Eventually, I broke up with him only for us to start speaking 2 -3 months after that, he travelled to see me multiple times but we didn‚Äôt get back together for about 8 months and we were both sleeping with  other people (me earlier on compared to him). During this period, he became closer to a friend that used to have feelings for him, let‚Äôs call her Sarah, he reassured me that was old and she no longer liked him. Sarah would stay at his for the weekend and he wouldn‚Äôt pick my calls because Sarah‚Äôs a light sleeper or they were using his phone to watch Netflix. I remember going to his dad‚Äôs birthday to see Sarah also travelled all the way, my ex-boyfriend was being friendly to her and snappy at me at this party, asked to take pictures with her and I pretty much forced to take pictures with me where he said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make this quick‚Äù while he and I were taking pictures. In all of this we were still not dating but it was more of an extended talking stage as we were unofficially dating. Eventually we decide to get back together but instead of asking me out, he just kept doing things I had complained about consistently, we would have fights multiple times a day for months. I was frustrated and broke up with him but went back to beg him to take me back after 3 months because love.
Now he says he‚Äôs taking time to get over the hurt I caused from breaking up which I understand but he says he wants us to get back together as well, he just needs time. He tells me he had sex with Sarah after we broke up, that hurt me so much because I feel like a fool for believing him then.
He also started seeing another girl Sam, when we broke up, he has/ had feelings for her but he says he‚Äôs ended things with her. 
Fast forward to two days ago, he asked me to lend him some money for Sam, she needed money to complete her school fees and would pay back in less than a week. I felt so heartbroken and disrespected by this, it triggered really hurtful memories of how he‚Äôs treated me when it comes to his female friends.
I try to explain how these events are linked but he doesn‚Äôt get it says he‚Äôs sorry but I shouldn‚Äôt be bringing up the past.

I‚Äôve since brought up my desire to be in a relationship twice (sad, I know) and his response is always the same. I‚Äôve accepted that he doesn‚Äôt want a relationship but I just hate how blurred the lines seem to be. He‚Äôs always so sweet and affectionate when we‚Äôre together and we almost always talk even when we know we won‚Äôt be seeing each other for a few days, but I feel like he‚Äôs constantly giving me mixed signals. For instance, he‚Äôs said that he ‚Äúchanged his ways for me‚Äù, that he thinks we‚Äôre going to be in each other‚Äôs lives forever, that I‚Äôm the only person he‚Äôs been with in months, that he thinks he cares about me more than I care about him, etc.

As much as I like him, I feel like I only get more and more attached whenever we see each other and that I‚Äôm only setting myself up for more hurt. I‚Äôve been wanting to cut ties for a few months now but I never had the courage to do so considering I tend to become attached very early on). I‚Äôm also not much of a social butterfly so I don‚Äôt exactly have many options (I‚Äôm not super fond of dating apps). 

I eventually just told myself that if I couldn‚Äôt work up the courage to end things, I‚Äôd keep seeing him until I got tired of the way things are and I think I‚Äôve finally reached that point. The last time we saw each other, he randomly felt the need to tell me he‚Äôd be going to a party on Saturday. While I know I don‚Äôt have a right to be jealous or angry, it really upset me considering he knows how I feel about him and I kind of just assumed he was only going to find someone to hookup with. Even though it may not have been his intent, I can‚Äôt help but feel like he said it because he knew it‚Äôd make me jealous. I think  another big reason it upset me was because he said he‚Äôd be working the day of the party when there have been numerous times where he‚Äôs said he didn‚Äôt want to see me because he was ‚Äútoo tired‚Äù from working that day. I became visibly upset and passive aggressive after he mentioned the party and we ended up having a long talk about everything.

I guess him mentioning the party was the final straw that made me realize just how tired I am of investing so much energy and emotion into nothing.

I get that, but like... I still feel like some of that blame could've been mine simply bc of how stubborn I was about it. It was always the same process: text guy and do the stuff he wants, get caught after like a month by mom, big fight, forgiveness, repeat in two weeks. At some point even if the question of ""why are these adults sexing up a 14-year-old?"" is still a thing, there's a backburner question of ""why does this 14-year-old keep trying to sex up older guys?"" Doubly weird cuz I didn't even have a reason to be doing it in childhood (my mom would say lack of friends but idk).

Like the way I see it, it's like trying to keep a cat from eating your plants. Obvi it's a cat and it's not gonna immediately know not to eat the plant, and it's up to the human to take measures and scold the cat for trying to eat it.

1709238881.0,I (30s F) think my mum (60s) is autistic.,"I (30s F) think my mum (60s) is autistic.

My sibling and I suggested this to her several years ago. Last year I pushed her on her lack of interest in developing or sustaining all and any type of relationships and she told me she had considered it for a few years and thinks she‚Äôs autistic but she has no wish to seek assessment/diagnosis as she‚Äôs ‚Äúalways been this way‚Äù so it ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt change anything‚Äù.

When I was a child she used to have frequent meltdowns; screaming, crying, storming out of the house, driving away, not returning for hours. I used to wonder if she‚Äôd ever come back, it was very distressing to me and has left me with longstanding attachment issues. As a teenager I remember trying to do nice things for her for a nugget of praise or being noticed by her e.g. hoovering her car for her, and remember being screamed at by her in response. She neglected our needs regarding periods/bras etc. 

She has very limited interests and her behaviour is largely inflexible. Suggestions to do things are met with no or ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù which invariably means never. I realised a few years ago if I make no attempt to facilitate and scaffold the conversation with her we will sit in silence (which while I appreciate may be enjoyable for her, is not for me). I realised I had filled in the gaps for her a lot socially (I‚Äôm an Allist extrovert) even as a child, and carried things (as my dad did before for her, when they were still together). She is hypersensitive to sounds and tastes. I had a very restricted diet growing up with unseasoned, bland food as that is what she liked. I thought I didn‚Äôt like many foods until my late 20s, but gradually grew to realise I do but I just like some form of seasoning or taste rather than bland tasteless. I didn‚Äôt learn to cook until I taught myself when I left home as she didn‚Äôt like anyone else in the kitchen while she was cooking. In terms of activities, if she was not interested or did not like it, we did not do it. This led to a very boring and limiting early life for me. 

One part of me knows I need to accept that she is autistic and not expect her to make changes or accommodations or be able to meet those childhood needs I had or the needs I have as an adult daughter (for some level of emotional connection?). Another part of me feels somewhat disappointed and ? angry/resentful that she was unable to meet some of my childhood needs and that I‚Äôve got to go along with her ride and do everything her way (in my contact with her). I attempt to meet her needs, but I struggle with the lack of reciprocation (eg my sibling organised a birthday party for me for my 30th and my mum refused to attend which was deeply hurtful for me, she refused to meet my boyfriend etc). I long for an emotional connection with her‚Ä¶ but I think I need to accept that it was not meant to be?

1709233998.0,Am I placing a higher standard on my mother?,"I'm 22F. I live with my mother,her husband and my 2 sisters. I carry so much guilt knowing that for 17 years I've either been living a lie or perpetuating one. My sisters don't know the truth and I'm afraid that it might fuck them up completely. I don't know if it's my place to tell them or not.My biological father abandoned me at birth and in my early years,I was raised by my mom and maternal grandparents. My mother got married to her husband when I was 5. At that time,I believed he was my biological father. He was very good with me and had promised my mother that he would adopt me after they got married. My mother was pregnant  during the wedding and my dear sister was born. Afterwards,everything changed. He refused to adopt me,which I honestly don't hold against him. But he did a complete 180 and began abusing me. It began with the emotional and finally the physical. My mother was aware of this but nothing changed. I remember wondering why he hated me so much. At the age of 7-8,I tried to unalive myself by ingesting concoctions of dirt and raw meat...but in retrospect it's a bit laughable because nothing came out of it,other than you know,what came out .
My teacher (an angel)noticed some bruising on my face and notified my maternal grandparents as they were friends. My maternal grandparents confronted my parents and my mother decided to move out of my step fathers house for a couple of weeks. We moved back in. He stopped the physical abuse but the emotional abuse was heightened. My mother never stepped in. At this point I wondered why my father would hate me so much and so I wrote a letter that I wanted to leave after I tried to unalive myself again. My mother found it and gave it to my maternal grandparents. The contents of the letter were basically listing all the abuse I'd get from my step father, wondering why I was so unlovable and the most heartbreaking part was that i decided I had to suffer because my mother loved this man. My grandparents told me that I had to persist because my mother loved this man and that's just how fathers behave. 
Some years later while i was using my mother's phone,I saw a text from her friend basically consoling her over the loss of her father in law. I really didn't understand because my grandpa was alive at that time. And it hit me that this was the death of my biological grandfather. I never told her what I saw but I recorded it in my diary.He was a famous politician and i remember watching his burial on youtube over and over trying to grasp at any sort of info i could get . A few years later while I was in  school,she went through my diary at home. She confronted me over things I had written about boys and then about my biological grandad and by extension dad.She admitted that my step father wasn't my biological dad and quickly made it about herself and began to explain that she wasn't even invited for the funeral.Looking back,I think that was the day I switched off from my mum.
She's made up this fantasy land where she makes everything look perfect on the outside but the reality is that her husband treats me as though I don't exist and secluded me from my sisters and we act like it's normal. No one brings it up and it's been like that for some time. When my relatives are around everyone pretends to be happy and inclusive and it has taken a huge toll on my mental health. I had a mental breakdown last year and I don't know what to do at this point. My mother likes teasing me because she knows I can't go against her. She talks about my biological father and his family with me and my sister,yet my sister doesn't even know who he is. It's like manipulative teasing. Idk...and when she sees she's getting to me,she sends me tiktoks about moulding my psychology. I don't know what to do. I'm so sorry it was this long.If you made it here,thanks for reading this.

1709217297.0,Is this mansplaining in the workplace? ,"Hi all, I have no idea who to ask or where to post this really but I need an advice.

I will explain the situation and try to be as impartial as I can be, I need a fresh pair of eyes to tell me whether my mind is playing tricks on me.

I work in a team of six people, 4 women in their 30s, 1 man in his 50s and (male) manager in his 60s. All with previous background and experience in the field.

This guy and the manager worked together prior to the team being formed, so they knew each other. Rest of us joined in a span of year. Since it is very multicultural team I don't take to heart lot of things, as it comes with the territory of working in diverse teams. Sometimes people say stuff that doesn't translate well or come across as too direct because of their background. 

My issue however is completely different. I was the first to join the team and my manager always sent me to work with this guy. Understandably so, it was just the two of us. Same happened with others. Bear in mind that we have different roles and scopes, our jobs are related but not the same. I thought it was just the onboarding part. But over the time I noticed that this guy is involved in every project, taking over projects from me and my team mates, always assigned to 'help'. Projects outside of his scope. And he is calling the shots in these projects. At times he takes over and just cuts the others - leave them out of emails, calls, etc. He gets super defensive if someone disagrees with his ideas and even goes to say - I am tired of justifying my ideas, perhaps I was assigned because of my seniority, this is not a democracy (when all women disagreed on his proposal but manager and he wanted to run it). And he really goes and says stuff like - do you know how to setup out of office message in outlook, how to setup subscription, etc. Colleague of mine added to her deck on how many projects she is working on and he remarked - playing numbers I see, I can be a showoff too. Recently I suggested we chizzle down a process and his response - if you say so, I am just curious who gets to decide this, you or we, because we will use it, not you. 

And my manager is purposefully assigning this man to all of our projects and tasks. Citing his seniority. I once told him that I asked feedback from other teammate, mostly same job role as his, and my manager said to ask him because he jas lot more to offer. But at this point I feel like this is just mansplaining from both of them. And I am not sure how to address this with them or just go straight to HR? And again, is it really that bad or am I just making it up? I would understand him being part of projects that are in his scope, some outside even. But all of them is sus.

1709211732.0,UK: Sarah Everard murder and systemic misogyny enabling gender violence,"I am at an utter loss an so raging right now. Here in the UK a report has been released about the murder of Sarah Everard, kidnapped under pretence of a false arrest by a Met police officer before being raped and killed. 

One bad apple? Except Wayne Couzens indecently exposed himself (including masturbating in his car) while on duty and was reported eight times (one incident was days before he killed Sarah) and all reports were bungled (ignored/covered up) by the two police forces involved. He also showed violent porn to colleagues. Again ignored.

Systemic misogyny allowed this man to carry on unhindered and enabled the horrific gendered killing of this woman. And I want to do something. I just don't know what!

1709211352.0,I have an Intense crush on my boss/colleague ,"I‚Äôm so sorry this has to come out so it‚Äôs going to be a long one. Grab a drink and a snack and strap in. 

I‚Äôm 35F, married, 2 kids. He‚Äôs 37M.

I changed careers a few years ago and the first company I applied to, Max (who I would be reporting to) invited me for an interview. I had no experience in the field, and was completely self taught (tech). This didn‚Äôt bother Max at all and he was very enthusiastic during the interview. He was charming and I noted that he was attractive and articulate and I was very flattered by his enthusiasm. At the end of the interview he said ‚ÄúThis is unorthodox but I can tell you now I‚Äôm going to hire you so you can stop looking now. You need to do a code test, which I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll ace and then one more interview but I assure you, I‚Äôm going to pick you.‚Äù Needless to say I was extremely flattered and overjoyed. 

I did ace the test (it was difficult but I wasn‚Äôt about to disappoint this guy who clearly believed in me) and the second interview was a breeze as I could tell it was more of a ‚Äúhey team look what I found!‚Äù kinda interview with some other higher ups in attendance with Max.  When it was over Max came to chat and told me I did amazing and again reiterated that they would be sending an offer. The admin side of things was a bit delayed as it was a big company and Max contacted me *every single day for 2 weeks* to let me know my offer letter was coming, HR was just taking their time, it‚Äôs all been signed off, sit tight, don‚Äôt accept anything else please. It felt amazing! How lucky was I?! And sure enough, the offer letter came, I accepted, signed contract, hired! 

I‚Äôm telling you all this so that you can understand how this dude has made me feel ‚ú®amazing‚ú® since the day I first met him. Working with him was even more amazing! He‚Äôs genius level intelligent, an excellent teacher and mentor, and a generally fantastic and understanding boss. Everybody liked him so I thought nothing of absolutely adoring him. 

We spoke for hours everyday, if we had an hour work meeting we would hang back for an extra 30 mins to an hour just talking non-work related stuff. This is where we shared that he‚Äôs married, and so am I. I have a kid, he does not etc. Adores his wife. He spoke about her often and with a lot of love. It made me like him even more. We had work lunches, he bought me a gaming console and paid for a game so we could game together, you know, as part of team building. We watched series ‚Äútogether‚Äù (ie we would watch episodes at our respective homes and then discuss at work). All part of keeping a work play balance. I was all for it cos I thought he‚Äôs amazing and a hoot, I do not mind. 

The first time I ever thought anything of any of this, was when I went in to work because there was construction noise near my home, and the second I walked in the reception lady said ‚ÄúMax isn‚Äôt here yet, where should I say you‚Äôll be?‚Äù I was genuinely surprised and said i wasn‚Äôt meeting him. Then she smirked and said ‚Äúoh how boring for you‚Äù y‚Äôall I nearly died. My heart sank into my stomach. Why would she say that? I tried to ignore it and go about my day but then Max showed up abt 2 hrs later to have lunch (as of course we had had work calls and noted that I was in the office). Normally I would have thought nothing of it except great, my lunch buddy is here but now I was thinking omg the receptionist is going to make something of this. And she did. When we walked out she said oh I see Max found you, smirk. Y‚Äôall. 

Anyway, I started actually paying attention to how much time we were spending together, what we were doing and whether it could be misconstrued. We never flirted, we never texted on any other platform except the work chat platform. When we exchanged memes and stuff it was always in the team channel. Our private chats were 100% work. We didn‚Äôt even use emojis! On the face of it, everything was above board. Except, in the team channel it was always just me and him backing and forthing. Occasionally might be the other guys, but going through it, it was just us. I had chalked this to us being so similar. Like, finish each others sentences, similar. We like the same stuff and have a very similar work style and even sense of humour. I literally feel he‚Äôs just a 100% male version of me. Ok 90% because he‚Äôs genius level smart. I also noted that he was always showing up whenever I‚Äôd be in the office. Or he would straight up say let‚Äôs go to the office today and I‚Äôd happily oblige. And it would 80% be just us two out of the team. Or if others joined, we‚Äôd all go for lunch but me and him would always go for coffee just us or sit together just us. But I never assigned anything inappropriate to our interactions and I didn‚Äôt believe he did either. We just happened to get along fantastically. 

But once I started paying attention I realised others weren‚Äôt seeing it that way. In fact it began to seem like an office in-joke, there those two go again. There was even a colleague who would say ‚Äúwhere is *your* Max‚Äù and refer to me as Max‚Äôs {my name}. I had just assumed it was because he took a chance on me so I‚Äôm like his ‚Äúfind‚Äù. There was nothing untoward that ever took place, not once so I chose to ignore the teasing and let us continue living our best work lives. I even hate the concept of work wives/husbands and not once did I view him that way. To be honest I was just glad a guy like him found enough in common with me to want to hang out with at work. And so I came to the conclusion that I might have a tiny harmless crush on him. Until‚Ä¶

He resigned. He made the announcement in a team meeting (12 members plus 2 more senior than him, all male except me) cameras on. I visibly gasped. I could feel all eyes on me. AND TEARS STARTED FALLING OUT OF MY STUPID EYES WITH MY CAMERA ON!!!!

So I switched my camera off (which I struggled to do due to my meltdown so it took like 3.5 seconds of fumbling with my mouse) and he asked if I was ok, and I gave an AUDIBLY TEARFUL, no. And that I had to go. He said sure let‚Äôs actually end the call and let everyone digest. I have never been so heartbroken and embarrassed in my life and nothing worse has happened since and I‚Äôve been through some shit. I wanted to literally die. I was thankful I was alone at home because y‚Äôall I was hollering in despair. Proper ugly crying. How could he leave?! Even Worse how could he not give me a heads up?? This is when I realised I obviously thought more of our relationship than he did. I truly was just another coworker. There was nothing special about me at all. Omg I expected to feel special?? What the hell was going on?! And my heart was in actual pieces. Blown to smithereens. And now my work reputation, tatters. Now everyone knew I wasn‚Äôt so special after all and I had CLEARLY thought I was. And now I had also made him look like an asshole because now it would seem like he misled me. Which I will maintain he did not. Other sources claim he knew what he was doing and used me to fill whatever void he must‚Äôve had. I can accept this, but clearly so did I. Probably way more than he ever did. He was prob just fond of me. And here I was expecting that this married man would inform me, a married woman and mother of 1, a subordinate on his team, of his career and life plans.

I was in shambles. I realised how wholly inappropriate, even though innocent, our interactions were. I would kill my husband if he ever regularly ran off to go have lunch with his fave female coworker. Or if he bought her a console to game with him. Or constantly hung back to chat about life and the universe with her. I‚Äôd threaten divorce! And yet here I was‚Ä¶

Needless to say the next few weeks were totes awkies. He completely pulled away and I nearly died. I told my husband I was ill. I was. Every interaction with Max going forward was painfully formal. The memes stopped the lunches stopped the chats stopped. Everything just ended because I couldn‚Äôt be professional. And I couldn‚Äôt be professional because I had been in denial about the extent of my feelings so I was hit by surprise by how strongly I felt. Anyway he completed his notice period without another smile in my direction and left.

Then one day when I was at the office, one of my colleagues asked if I wanted to join him for lunch. This wasn‚Äôt too out of the ordinary, I didn‚Äôt only speak to Max. So we went and when we sat he says ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm not Max, but hopefully I can be just as interesting ‚Äú Y‚Äôall. I know he was probably just trying to be nice but wow‚Ä¶ he ended up confessing his love for me a short time later and I had to remind him I‚Äôm married. He just said he knows but wanted me to know. I never spoke to him socially again and I died inside thinking Max probably saw me the same way I seeing this guy. Wholly inappropriate. God just kill me now.

I survived. Years went by. I joined another company, had another baby. Heard through the grapevine that Max got divorced. Whatever. (I was so heartbroken for him omg) . Life went on. Until now. 

One of the other managers from my former company reached out, asked if I was interested in coming back. It was a great company and I only left to diversify my experience. So I agreed. Sign the contracts and I start work. Guess who now consults for the company ON MY PROJECTS. Guess who will be mentoring ME through a slightly more complex project. Guess who I have to once again speak to everyday a hundred times a day? Had I known Max now consults for the company and I would have regular interaction with him, would I have accepted? 

Yes. Yes I would and I wouldn‚Äôt even hesitate. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me.

And now everyday I can‚Äôt breathe and everything is painfully formal even though he sometimes calls me by the nickname he used to call me by before awkwardly correcting himself to my real name. I never experienced a ‚Äúpregnant silence‚Äù until now. Whenever we‚Äôre done talking about work on a call we would launch into casual chat about absolutely anything. But now, the call ends, he awkwardly says bye. I say bye. There‚Äôs a weird two seconds, a pregnant silence, where we‚Äôre just looking at each other. Then he goes ‚Äúwell ok then, bye‚Äù or I just say ok I‚Äôm hanging up and he says ok. Sometimes I hang up too fast to try and avoid the preggers two seconds and then I die from cringe because it was so awkward. 
It‚Äôs painful y‚Äôall. But am I secretly overjoyed and look forward to work everyday? Yes. Absolutely. 

What is wrong with me?

Thank you for coming to my state of the nation address.

TL;DR I was unaware I had a crush on my boss. I had a meltdown in front of colleagues when he announced he‚Äôs leaving. Years went by. He‚Äôs back with the company consulting on my projects. I feel like screaming everyday. Was I imagining things first time around? Does it even matter?

1709203857.0,Obgyns suck- a rant,"Kinda long heads up. Just need to get this off my chest I'm so done.

I am 2 or 3 days shy of being 37 weeks pregnant. I also am medicated for being bipolar. Nbd, it's actually worked out well weirdly enough the extra hormones seem to be leveling me out way more instead of having me go full blown cray-cray like I was worried about. Unfortunately though at the birth of my 1st child things didn't go right and now I'm left with a continents worth of birth related trauma.

Now I mention this cause I've been completely transparent about everything with my Dr's office. They have made it clear though that my mental health isn't their priority regarding the birth of this child and only the child health matters. Which fucking sucks. They didn't say it outright but have made comments that maybe I ""seek some therapy for that trauma"" like excuse me bitch I still am hence the only reason I'm pregnant now? Like Jesus.

I've discussed having a c-section as I had to have one with my 1st and planning one would be best for me to avoid much of the trauma. They agreed no problem. I asked it be at 38 weeks, they pushed back due to not being standard procedure. I insisted there had to be some way to make it happen due to having been told earlier by one of their drs AND nurses that full term is considered 37 weeks. They said they'd ask the ob surgeons on staff at hospital on my 38th week if one would be willing to do a c-section earlier than standard procedure. Great. 

Well this nurse contacted me trying to schedule my c-section yesterday. At my 39th week. On my MILs fucking birthday. (Dislike her not super important lol) I pushed back and said nah I'm not accepting that date. She was shocked. Said days will fill up fast. Idfc I said no. And to check my file cause it certainly doesn't sound as if anyone actually tried to get me in at my 38th week. She checked and said ""there's no real note of them saying they'd do what you're saying just that you mentioned wanting it at 38 weeks"". 

Are. You. Fucking. JOKING?! I've discussed IN LENGTH at multiple appointments with 2 separate Dr's about them trying to get me in at 38 weeks if possible. They just never put it in my file apparently. So I had her send an urgent message to the Dr who made the note of my request to figure it out and call me asap to figure out scheduling. I'm still on the schedule for when they originally said ""just in case"".

I'm just so fucking done. At this point I'm just gonna say fuck it and not schedule shit and just go into labor randomly and trigger all my trauma since apparently I'm not important enough to give a shit about unless my body is in distress or the baby is. They don't give a fuck about how the nicu is there for a reason. Now idt this baby would need it if it came early by 1 week but God forbid the nicu is there for that. And frankly what they'd be fixing would be ""very partially under developed lungs"" which in comparison to my mental health going down the toilet is a simple fix.

Hate me if you want but that's how I see it. They can fix her with their knowledge. How exactly am I supposed to be fixed mentally quick enough to take care of my newborn? What about my 4.5 year old? My cats? My husband? Yea he's gonna help paternity leave is already set up. But like. He can't do it alone if I'm not mentally well enough to take a bit off his plate. (He's great but prone to stress induced anxiety attacks) My mom is the only one able to come and help at the drop of a dime everyone else works demanding jobs they can't leave. But my mom can't help because the woman just had open heart surgery 2 weeks ago. Emergency last minute surgery mind you, she had fully planned on helping like with my 1st.

I'm just tired of feeling like the magic fucking school bus that the kid is partying in, constantly uncomfortable, not sleeping enough, and the heartburn that just won't go away no matter what I do. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not worth considering when it comes to birth cause apparently the baby needs to come first I'm just merely the incubator. I'm tired of being scared.

I thought they'd be supportive and sympathetic since I can't be the only patient they've had with birth trauma. I was evidently completely wrong. They don't care and never will. I was gonna ask for my tubes to be tied but at this point I'd rather find a new Dr to do it at a later date than have to deal with this fucking office full of twats for anything more. I thought my faith in Dr's was slightly returning at the beginning of this pregnancy due to how kind they were at first. Their tune has now changed and all faith is gone from me.

I joined here after finding this subreddit googling and found someone else's experience with an endometrial biopsy, so I thought I could ask here. I just wanted to know what was normal and what wasn't. I got my biopsy done last week (still waiting on results). It was the worst experience of my life. I wasn't numbed,  didn't know to take any kind of pain relief before or after. Was told it would be a small pinch and literally sat there soobbing and wailing and squeezing the life out of my s/o's hand the entire 15 minutes it took to do the procedure. It was so overwhelmingly painful I got up afterwards and almost blacked out from the pain. The doctor didn't really explain what to expect afterwards other than bleeding and cramping for the next 48 hours, and I feel like maybe something might be wrong? Like I said I'm a week out from my biopsy, and I've been bleeding since then (not on my period), not heavy but definitely enough for a pad, and the cramping has progressively gotten worse. I'm almost doubled over by how bad it feels, it's like being stabbed in the cervix and the uterus, it's awful. The muscle also feels like it's contracting or twitching at times. Is this normal after this procedure? I feel like a baby because they made it out to seem like it would be no big deal, but the whole process has been bringing me to tears from how excruciatingly painful and emotionally overwhelming it's been, and I wanted to get other people advice and perspectives.

A [study by Disabled American Veterans](https://www.dav.org/wp-content/uploads/Women-Veterans-Study-2024.pdf) describes the unique risk factors that led to an increase in suicide rates among female veterans between 2020 and 2021. Researchers found that between those years, suicides among veteran women jumped by 24%, an increase ‚Äúvastly higher‚Äù than the rise among civilian women, where cases were relatively flat. One of those factors is domestic violence or intimate partner violence, IPV. The study also said that 1 in 5 female veterans reported experiencing intimate partner violence in the last year to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 

We must become our own advocate.  One of the hardest things for a veteran to do is to love themselves because we feel that we have done bad things or we have been participants in things that we shouldn‚Äôt have.

1709162891.0,What's a red flag you've experienced during a medical visit?,"I have no health concerns and just maintain a few medications (migraines and ADD). I've been on maintenance for these for the past decade and a half - no changes, no issues. I don't go to the doctor with any regularity because I'm genuinely not sick. 

My current (male) GP decided unilaterally to stop my ADD meds without telling me. I think it's kind of bad form to suddenly stop a psychiatrist-prescribed medication cold turkey after 13 years, but I'm not the one with the MD after my name, I guess. 

I would explain to him that my ADD diagnosis wasn't done for the lols, but... *I can't get hold of him*. The giant ""health"" conglomerate makes it impossible to speak to a doctor; all I'm getting are automated messages that my prescription is denied.

So, time to switch doctors.

I had my first meeting with a new (female) GP today. Our conversation centered entirely around two things: my reproductive system and my weight.

I'm in my late 40s and don't have kids. Why do I need to answer tons of questions about birth control, pregnancies, and pap smears? I've never seen a cardiologist. I don't have regular checkups with a neurologist. I don't keep up-to-date medical records with an ear / nose / throat specialist. But my uterus might be used someday to bear male heirs, and that's what we focus on, I guess. 

Is it weird that we don't screen any other organs for cancer other than my tits and my coochie? 

Because it feels weird.

I'm 145lb, and 5'4"". Am I fat? Yes. I should weigh about 120lb. In fact, a few years ago, I did weigh 120lb. But a few years before *that*, I weighed 200lb. I lost 80 pounds via diet and exercise alone, and during the last couple of years I unfortunately packed 30 back on. I'm working on losing it and have dropped 5 this year. Hell, I even ran to and from the doctor's office (10 miles round trip). 

Before I mentioned my weight loss, the doctor started in on my current weight. Did I have diabetes screenings? Was I aware of type 2 diabetes? Did I know what a *calorie* was? 

She questioned me on my eating habits and asked me if I could consider eating out less. Puzzled, I told her cooking was actually one of my hobbies, and eating out was rare. She actually quizzed me: What foods had I cooked from scratch lately? Or was I just talking about heating up hot pockets? 

She harped on the need to ""skip dessert and eat fruit instead"". I am fat because I use *cheese* in place of *oxygen.* No sweet tooth, genuinely.

I told her at this point that I was pretty familiar with how to eat healthy and exercise. I explained I'd been 200lb six or seven years back and lost weight via diet and exercise. *Still* not good enough: her very next question was ""Did you lose that weight in a healthy manner?""

This is week two without my ADD meds, so my ability to process information is severely impacted. Hence asking Reddit's advice.

Thoughts? Should I keep looking for another GP? Or is it to be expected that an intake will focus on my uterus and my fat?

Curly is older, and drives me insane. He's constantly peering into my cube to see what I'm working on (none of it is his realm. I'm an IT business analyst, he's a technical analyst). When he isn't peering in my cube, he's printing reams of paper while his wife calls him every hour on the hour.

My boss comes back on Monday. Today it was as if a switch flipped in Curly. He's had access to all the meetings I'm in but has never attended. All of a sudden he's in there, asking questions that don't pertain to the meeting. The last straw was when he talked to one of the C levels concerned about part of the project.

It's a part that I'm the main stakeholder in. It's mostly my responsibility and I need it to start mid March because I have to get the presentation ready for users 

The c level and Curly come to my desk asking when are ""we"" going to start because it needs to be done soon?

I just blink slowly for a minute before telling them both that Curly was welcome to start it off if he was so concerned.

C level: I thought you usually handle the user access and figuring in what they need.

Me: I do. So I'm trying to figure out why you and Curly are trying to fucking dictate my schedule when I'm also doing the work of a c level while my boss is gone?

C level has worked with me for two years. He knows when I'm fed the fuck up and knows to stand down immediately. He makes excuses and runs out the room. Curly stands there bewildered before I told him to get away from my desk.

This isn't his responsibility. When it kicks off he'll be of absolutely no help because when we were trained, he nearly broke our sandbox environment. The responsibility was shuttled off to me because I'm able to cut through user bullshit and get them what they need without tearing things apart.

Our boss asks us both to research stuff. He frequently comes back quickly with an answer, but it's never answering the question that was asked. I don't know how the hell he has not been fired or even how the fuck he got hired, but I'm ready to jump him. There is a ton on my plate right now and I don't need someone who doesn't know what they're doing adding to my plate.

*Rant over*


Update: looking over the email my boss sent, I realize why Curly went to the c-level. In the list of instructions my boss left behind, he mentioned that particular c level had some employees that needed additional access and wanted me to figure what they needed (we're moving to a new ERP system so there is a learning curve.) Curly was trying to fix them up. But he doesn't know how to assign roles or access, nor how to figure out what they need. (To be fair, I'm the only one on the team that knows how to search for responsibilities within the ERP system because I knew it was going to be on me to assign that shit). He misworded everything because he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. Still it was none of his business or concern as it was clearly assigned to me in the email. Still angry. Currently I'm glaring at him as I dump miralax into my water.

Update 2: Curly just sent a fucking email. It was a reply all on the list of responsibilities my boss left. He snitched on the manager of infrastructure that he was out sick for two days. The thing is, it's not snitching. He sent an email with everyone on the team listed, letting us (and our boss!) Know he'd be out sick.

He then wrote how he facilitated working with the c-level about the roles shit.

Before I could hit reply, I felt someone grab my arm and yank me out of my chair. It was our sys admin. He is a super quiet guy, barely speaking above a whisper. He pulled me out of our area and dragged me to the server room. 

""You can scream in here, no one will hear you."" He said this as he sat on the floor and waited.

I did what he said. When I stopped, he let me out.

1709153191.0,Does anyone else with a curvy body or breasts feel constantly disappointed with the way they look in clothing? ,"I feel like modern clothes have been designed for very small breasted women for so long now and I always expect that when I buy some thing it‚Äôs going to look differently on me then it ends up looking. I feel like the fashion industry has for decades ignored what the majority of women‚Äôs bodies look like. I don‚Äôt think my breasts are abnormally large, they are barely a D cup, but they look proportional enough and they grew on me naturally. Yet when I wear clothes off the rack, I feel I either look too sexy or like a shapeless lump. It‚Äôs literally one of the other every time. If I wear something that is curving around my breasts I get stares and I begin to feel inappropriate. If I try to wear something that looks more ‚Äòchic‚Äô I look lumpy and shapeless. 

For example, I have some sweaters that all look 1 million times better on my friends with very small breasts. When I put them on I look like a lumpy cow.. I‚Äôm not trying to insult myself I just mean I literally do not look good, I lose all shape and look like I gained 50 pounds. When my friends with no breasts or very small breasts put on the same sweaters they look so chic. It makes me sad because I want to wear fashionable clothing and look good like anybody else. It‚Äôs so annoying that I have a normal body and yet I feel like a shapeless lump just because I‚Äôm buying clothes that we are told are made for women. It destroys my confidence.",TwoXChromosomes

I had thought about it for a while to end it, and that just made me realize we were bringing each other down. I hope she finds those friends who lift her up honestly. I just knew I couldn't anymore because we changed too much as people. For her, it was a close friendship or nothing.

1709144060.0,As A WOC AN I wrong for not wanting to date white men because of major cultural differences and gaps?,"So I wanted to ask this to the women of Reddit and try to understand where I am coming from. I have nothing against white people and don‚Äôt hate them. I have a preference to date men of color because I‚Äôm also a woman of color, specifically black and Asian. Throughout my dating history I have dated mostly white men due to the part of the country I live in which has a predominantly white population. What I have learned from that experience was that there was a lack of cultural understanding, at times their racism and sexism showed up over time as they have gotten more comfortable with me and that raised huge red flags for me. The white men I have dated have also never stood up for me in instances of racism, and have become defensive when calling them out. I also experienced other red flags that are probably not race based but more so their upbringing or environment based. 

I was called a racist when a white man asked me out and I told him no, and he kept asking me why. I initially just said no because I‚Äôm not interested and he kept pestering so I said because we don‚Äôt have any commonalities, and then he asked what commonalities, and so I said we have too much of a cultural difference. He then took that as it‚Äôs bc he‚Äôs white and called me racist. 

Am I wrong for this? I also don‚Äôt particularly find white men as attractive anymore due to past behaviors I‚Äôve witnessed from my peers, dates, and sometimes daily interactions with the public. It‚Äôs not good to judge with a broad stroke but I am tired of trying to educate a white partner and call them out on their behavior. I‚Äôd love to give people a chance and maybe I am missing out on an opportunity with a great guy just because they‚Äôre white, but if I do date someone white my hope is that they‚Äôve done the internal work to understand racism, like actually understand and that they live in a society that works for them and not for others, but it seems more often than not that goes over their head or they get defensive and angry about it. I want to be fair and date people who are good. What can I do? 

Edit: I have read some comments saying I am racist, but I did not say in here that I‚Äôve completely lost 100% interest in white men, I said I don‚Äôt find white men ad attractive as I use to think they were due to actions I‚Äôve witnessed as well as the treatments I‚Äôve received from white men I have dated intimately and causally. I have been sexually assaulted by several white men and have been stalked by white men, and I know any man is capable of doing those thing, but with the sexual assault, the men who did this to me later on went to marry white women and the rape in my eyes were a power move and dehumanization of me. I think this goes deeper than ‚ÄúI prefer someone that‚Äôs skinny, or I like guys with a beard‚Äù , it‚Äôs unfortunately due to past traumas that I am weary of white men. ",TwoXChromosomes
1709143591.0,When working in a male-dominated field sucks.,"I will preface by saying that some things will be left vague on purpose, and I am on mobile, so formatting may be off. All spelling and grammar mistakes are completely on me. Oh, and I'm a 39yo woman. It's a little long, TL:DR at the end.

A bit of background: I work at a steel mill. The work force is predominantly men. And it's an old steel mill, so there aren't even gendered bathrooms. There are 2-stall + urinal bathrooms littered all around the plant, and most of the doors are permanently stuck open. I describe all this, not to say I have a problem with it, just that for the most part, unless it's an emergency, I like to wait until I get back to the tiny women's locker room to do any extended toilet visits. 

Cut to today. I had to give a 2 hour tour of a system that I'm in charge of. Starting in a conference room, then proceeding around to different areas. Well, about 15 minutes in, I start to get a low level pain in my lower abdomen. I know what's coming, I know what this is. It's just the worst possible time for it to happen. I'm in the middle of presenting an overview of the system to 4 older men from various areas, and my boss. And I'm ignoring the pain, as well as the seeping feeling of my period starting. Thank all that matters that mine start out relatively light, though they do get heavier by the hour.

So I have another 15 minutes of this presentation to give before I can excuse myself to the nearest restroom before starting the walking tour. Mind you, all of my maintenance supplies are down 3 flights of stairs and 100 yard walk away. So I just confirm what I already know, and grab a wad of toilet paper, cause I've got nothing else. I walk out, hoping to get a moment to get my pain meds out of my backpack, and find some water, but the entire group is waiting at the door, and my boss says cheerily, ""let's go"" as soon as he sees my face. 

I put on my game face and get going. Having dealt with this all my life, I know I have about an hour an a half before the pain puts me all the way on my ass, but it will get progressively worse over that time. We're talking cold sweats, shaking, nausea, body pain... the works. It's managed relatively well by my pain meds, but if I hit nausea before I take them, it's game over. I give the tour, going up and down stairs, in and out of rooms, and really all over the place. My customer service smile is plastered firmly on my face, my voice is chipper. I'm asking and answering questions... all while my abdomen feels like it is trying to either rip into two, or turn itself inside out, the pain coming in waves that threaten me with light-headedness. 

Luckily, I think all of the stairs kept me moving enough to keep the worst at bay because I made it through my tour, and back to my backpack before it got bad enough the meds would no longer work, thankfully. From there about a half hour before the pain subsides to manageable (not gone, but not debilitating) levels. And the toilet paper managed to contain the majority of the mess. Small favors.

All this to say, sometimes I hate working with all men, and not feeling comfortable enough to take care of myself in a group situation. I hide it and pretend until I finish what I have to do, and hope that it won't bite me in the end.

TL:DR     I work with all men, and didn't feel comfortable telling them I started my period and needed a minute to handle it, so gave a 2hr tour with toilet paper in my panties and worsening cramps that I hid.",TwoXChromosomes

I looked at his profile and he ended up being pretty cute and I didn‚Äôt know if a 2 year age gap was bad (still don‚Äôt know), so we start snapping back and forth for like a little over 2 weeks.

Which I am really nervous but I really like him so I don‚Äôt want him to think that I don‚Äôt like him, so I ended up sending him one of me without a shirt on, still had a bra on, but he told me things that made me feel really good about myself so I kept going. He asked to see even more so I basically sent him me in full underwear, he basically has seen the entirety of my tits. I felt really gross after because I didn‚Äôt really want to send that stuff but I did so that he would like me.

1709141513.0,Drunk kissed my best friend whilst in relationship ,"Hi everyone. 
A month or so ago my best friend and I (25F) were out for dinner got blackout drunk & she kissed me. I don‚Äôt really remember much, just that I snapped back into consciousness when I kissed her back. I pushed her away after that and freaked out, cried in the bathroom for like 40 mins and went home. 
I told my bf (25M) the next morning who was really angry at me that I had cheated, which is fair enough. I take full accountability that I broke one of his boundaries. I told him I‚Äôd take a step back from the friendship with my best friend and he told me that if I do that it‚Äôs my own decision and to never hold it over his head. 
My best friend is pretty shocked this has caused such a reaction, she said it was a meaningless drunk kiss and she got carried away but it won‚Äôt happen again which I wholeheartedly believe. I‚Äôm missing her birthday and multiple holidays we had planned over a drunken mistake that wasn‚Äôt sexual or romantic in any way (I‚Äôm not gay). However I also understand my boufriend‚Äôs perspective and see how he sees it as cheating.  
However I‚Äôm at a point now where I genuinely fuckjng miss my best friend. We‚Äôve been friends for years and I don‚Äôt get how a dumb drunk action just made our friendship blow up. It‚Äôs extra frustrating because my boyfriend kissed a girl whilst drunk 2 years ago at a flat party. I forgave him because understood that mistakes get made and I had never seen him that drunk either; he‚Äôs never done it again. I also didn‚Äôt want to set a ‚Äúnever drink again‚Äù ‚Äúnever go out again‚Äù boundary because if I forgave him it meant I trust him and I genuinely wholeheartedly do. 
I‚Äôm frustrated because I obviously pick my boyfriend over my best friend but I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to. I want to respect his boundaries but this will never happen again, it was a drunken mistake and I‚Äôm not gay. I want to have my best friend back in my life but idk how to approach that. I don‚Äôt want to throw away my relationship for her either but I feel so so lonely and isolated and most of all guilty this whole thing has happened. 
I‚Äôm aware how self centered I come across considering I‚Äôm the one who fucked up but I genuinely don‚Äôt see it as a massive deal. My main concern is that I upset & hurt my boyfriend but I think it‚Äôs been blown out of proportion massively. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? How can I approach this with my boyfriend? I feel like I can‚Äôt even talk about how lonely I feel because he doesn‚Äôt deserve to have to comfort me but it‚Äôs all I think about.

I've told him I would feel more connected if he asked questions and paid attention to topics we can both talk about, but he still doesn't and just keeps doing this trivia-storytime thing. 

It's gotten to the point that our conversations are just him asking me some rhetorical question, that I do not have the option to actually answer, so he can tell me about some random fact that I have no interest in and did not ask about.

i am using my throwaway account for this one to avoid him potentially finding this post. i am absolutely broken.

about two and a half weeks ago now, we had a major argument and i told him that i needed a little bit of space from him after what he did, its too long of a story to exactly explain what he did, but he was very much in the wrong and admitted that himself after his friends called him out. after a day or two, i text him saying that i would like to talk it out and make up since i dont want to ignore him forever. he said ""okay but i understand if you hate me"", ??????? okay ????????

he comes back from work and i tap his shoulder, give him a hug and the kiss, but i think he got the wrong idea because he started taking off all my clothes immediately and proceeded to have sex with me. it was never my plan to have sex at all, i hate make up sex, i have told him this several times, but i didn't say anything since i missed him that much. i didnt agree to anything but i didnt want to make him upset. after all that is done, he becomes cold and distant in an instant, i asked him whats wrong. he says, ""can i be honest, i started losing feelings for you"". my stomach dropped. why the fuck did he have sex with me if he was losing feelings, he made it seem as if he still loved me and missed me. i asked him that exact same question. he says, ""i just wanted to get it out of my system"". so here i am sitting in bed right across from him eating the food he picked up after work as if he didn't just take advantage of me. how could he? i trusted him so much and he did this to me. i felt like i was nothing but a disposable sack of meat to him. he took out his sexual frustration on me when i was at my lowest. i just wanted to feel loved

&#x200B;

after this incident, we took time apart but i didnt recover from it so easily. i had to speak to my therapist and go back to therapy since i was in a state of shock. i had to go to work and i ended up crying in front of my boss. he pulled me aside and asked me what was wrong, i told him that im having some relationship problems and that i had to go back to therapy due to my disability worsening (i did not disclose what disability i had). and guess what  my boss did? he fired me for a ""lack of performance"" despite him telling me that i was on track with everything. so now im sitting here feeling absolutely awful about myself. i was proud of this job too, my boyfriend however said that it made him feel ""less of a man"" seeing me earn more than him. after i got fired, he seemed a lot more care free and went out with his friends every night, while i stayed at home feeling like a failure of a woman. i had to go home to take my mind of off everything, and thats when he dumps me over text. all of this happened in a span of TWO WEEKS.

so now im here writing this back home, i feel better about the break up now, but i can't stop thinking about how he took advantage of me and lied to me. my therapist said that this could potentially be considered assault but i dont know what to do. i cant tell my parents. i only told one other friend but she said that she considers that assault. i cant look at my body anymore, i feel so disgusted with myself for allowing that to happen to me. i always think about what i would do in those sort of situations, but now that it happened to me, its so hard to determine what to do. i hate that i still miss him. i hate it i hate it i hate it. hes out in school as if he did nothing to me. i dont think ill ever feel comfortable with myself ever again. it took me so long to accept who i am as a woman and feel empowered by all my accomplishments and goals, but all of that is gone now",TwoXChromosomes

His background: My mom died 3 yrs ago at age 60, he is 67, he began dating a young girl in her early 20s who is closer to his granddaughters age than his mine. Ever since then he has developed the dirtiest mouth I never knew could exist. He has always been on the cusp but maybe held back when my mom was alive. So for the last 3 years, I have heard all kinds of derogatory comments about womens vaginas. Ill list them below so dont read on if you prefer not to read such horrible things <3   


In a teacher tone."" After women give birth, their vaginas are ruined, they become floppy and never perfectly toned again. The only way to fix this is for the Dr to perform a husband stitch so that he will stay around and continue to have sex with her that is pleasurable. Your mom had a husband stitch every time and it was great!""  


When watching some politician on tv: ""That woman is just mad that her body is ruined and she is damaged goods after giving birth to 3 kids so her husband left her, thats why shes a b\*#@%""  


""I only date girls in their 20s because they are tighter down there and dont have damaged used up goods like the cows my age.""  


I was talking about my weight and how I wanted to try and gain a little bit more because I was getting a little too thin on a low carb diet and he turned it into this. ""HAHAH so you are a spinner are ya! You know what that is? (I didnt but had my suspicions) Yea its where a guy can spin you around on his d\*$% any way he wants because you are so light. My GF is a spinner and so was mom. Well im sure you husband will enjoy a little more cushion if you are no longer a spinner"".....no words  


He refers to older womens vaginas as meat curtains and how gross they are  


SOOOOO.... there are many more instances but I have never been close to him though not for a lake of desperate trying on my part, he never asks about my life or how I am doing, never gives gifts to me or his only grandchild (my daughter), hates birthdays and christmas, does not commit to memory anything I have asked or said about myself or life when I try to talk about myself (its weird being neglected because you try to talk about yourself because you arent asked but it still doesnt matter and you feel dumb for trying). I just know he thinks this way about my vagina after giving birth and it really upsets me. I have a daughter and am having another daughter and I know he probably just thinks about their vaginas. Like the world is seen through the lens of a womans worth based on how much she used up her vagina for sex or babies. If he stayed with me, I will be walking around sore after birth and trying to breastfeed, there is no privacy here (small townehouse) and id be locking myself in my room to nurse on a bed which is harder than being free to nurse on my couch which is most comfortable but all he wants to do is sit on the couch and watch the news 24/7 and complain about politics, then starts drinking for the rest of the night and thats when all the derogatory stuff comes out full force. I will not nurse in front of him. I dont even know why he wants to be here, he barely helps with anything with my current daughter, never spent time with her or made her feel seen, just like he was with my sister and I. Though he worships his son, who gets everything handed to him on a golden platter (free cars, college, substantial allowance at the age of 25 when he kept all of that from his 2 daughters) simply because he has male genitals and can pass on the family name. Evenstill....Im willing to have him come down maybe a month after she is born to stay here because by then I will hopefully not be an emotional roller coaster or walking around in vaginal pain after birth.",TwoXChromosomes

Joining the 4B movement, all the way from Canada.","For college gen ed, I decided to check out Women's Studies and ya'll, it's changed my life forever. It's like taking off blinders and seeing for the first time. I think everyone should take a women's studies class. We're going through the history of feminism, different types, it's relation to lgbtq and poc rights, etc. While studying, sometimes I really have to pause, take a deep breath and cry for a bit, our foremothers went through so much.

Our final paper is to discuss a feminist topic that's going on today. I'm doing mine on the 4B movement in SK and radical feminism, and literally I feel a shivers down my body when I do research. Imagine an entire government in a developed country, having an anti-feminist platform and seeing women as only incubators. Then imagine a large majority of the population (the men) AGREEING with that! Its gotten to a point where some 4B members fear for their life because calling yourself a feminist can be dangerous! I guess we don't have to imagine cause it's real life.

It's like it's so hard for them to have empathy and treat women like humans. That's actually crazy when put in words but it's not even an exaggeration. Not even an ounce of empathy from them. Studying radical feminism for my paper, this part of my text book stood out to me:

&#x200B;

>""Radical feminists identified women's oppression in men's control over women's bodies. For them, patriarchy was a culture of control and domination over women's bodies and sexuality""

&#x200B;

This trickles down to how in the nuclear family the man is 'head of the household' and its seen as normal. How homosexual love threatens that system. Just because we have uteruses, they decided motherhood should be the ultimate goal for us. How patriarchy's ties to capitalism is set up to make us spend more (while earning less!) to reach a beauty standard they made to make us more appealing to them. We pay, they don't. With our money and bodies. Alexa play Olivia Rodrigo's ""pretty isn't pretty enough"".

There's more than that but I'm shaken. I'm a r-pe victim, that changed my life. I get ptsd, I struggle to read news about reproductive rights cause I get trigged when it's bad news which is most days now. I want to regain control of my body. Now, I'm practicing 4B and feeling better but still so sad about the state of things. Feminism is still a touchy subject for lots of people when all we want is to be treated like humans. Why is asking for that so controversial?

Anyone else feeling the same or has had a similar experience? I don't know anyone else in real life who is part of the 4B movement.",TwoXChromosomes

1709129168.0,Consent in marriage ,"I‚Äôm having trouble getting over how my husband of almost 20 years handled a soft ‚Äòno‚Äô and the aftermath.  A month or two ago, we had an attempt at a risqu√© night at a club, and he changed his mind almost immediately - like we went in, he noped, and we left. I honoured his no right away, even though I was disappointed, as it was something we‚Äôve been trying to incorporate. Afterwards I didn‚Äôt feel like rushing to go home and have sex, I needed to connect, have a drink, allow myself to recalibrate from the disappointment. I said clearly that when we got home, I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for sex, can we cuddle, he seemed to hear me but then hit on me anyway, and I gave in. The sex was predictably bad and I felt a bit like ‚ÄòI violated myself‚Äô. I was kind of watching it happen, disappointed that he didn‚Äôt seem to notice either. We talked about it in therapy and I recall him being asked/reminded to ‚Äòhonour my no‚Äô. 

Last week, a rare opportunity came up where we were home alone - perfect for some sexy time. There was a strange moment, where he asked about some bumps on my vulva - ‚Äòwhat are those spots? They look like std spots?‚Äô I jumped up, horrified, and investigated in the bathroom. It was just normal skin, and I told him so, but the mood was GONE for me and I told him so. I offered him a bj, said I was happy to do that, but that I was just not feeling it otherwise, and even reassured him that he‚Äôd done nothing wrong, it wasn‚Äôt his fault. 

He pushed - I just want to be inside you. I gave in.  

I never said loudly, firmly, NO. I‚Äôm not scared of him either. I just‚Ä¶ gave in, and watched it happen. I was pretty much a dead fish, and turned down all his attempts at good self - no I don‚Äôt want a toy, I dunno how I want it, no I don‚Äôt want to tell you a story. He didn‚Äôt seem to notice, definitely didn‚Äôt stop or check in. 

A week later I told him that I was upset, and that I thought we‚Äôd gone over this recently in therapy.  His first reaction was defence, he can‚Äôt think of himself as that, he was confused by the bj, he was horny for me‚Ä¶ later he came back and was ‚Äòsorry I was made to feel that way‚Äô, at the very end of the day he was finally able to express some remorse‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm feeling thrown, like I‚Äôm making a big deal out of a small deal, but I don‚Äôt want to have sex with him at all, even though I don‚Äôt hate him.  I‚Äôm always questioning this marriage, and I can‚Äôt tell if this is the straw that breaks the camels back, or just part of a bale of hay we call relationships. I could take it back to therapy and we‚Äôll discuss it with her support and I‚Äôll get a better apology, and maybe it won‚Äôt even happen again, but I‚Äôm resentful that it happened at all, again.

1709115604.0,The best decision I ever made!,"I decided to get my fallopian tubes removed when I was in my 20's. I told nobody about it, because my whole culture perpetuates that motherhood and wife bondage are women's only value. I've heard it all, because they love voicing their opinions:


""What if you change your mind?!""

It's better to not have children I want than to have one I don't want. Plus, adoption exists. 


""You'll be missing out on a beautiful part of life."" 

Parenting devours time and crushes opportunities I prefer over hypothetical children. 


""What if your partner wants children.""

Then we aren't compatible. Women shouldn't risk their lives, health, and future for men's desires. 


""Just use birth control!""

No bc is 100% effective, and r*pe/stealthing is far from uncommon. 


""It's selfish!""

Welp, you're the only person who can truly prioritize yourself. So spoil yourself! There's nothing ""honorable"" about forcing a life into this world that you don't want, and begrudgingly raising it. 


I felt so relieved and empowered after the surgery. There was very little pain and I recovered in just a few weeks. I've never regretted the decision.

I was never really insecure about ‚Äúbody count‚Äù (ew, that phrase, gross) until I went through a breakup.

However, I was recently in a situationship with a guy who was pressed that I had experience. Btw, he was very experienced since he was a young teen. Like, probably way more than I was. We never shared numbers. He even told me at times that I didn‚Äôt value sex, which is not true at all. Thank god we‚Äôre NC now, my self-esteem is still recovering from that. 

I also was talking to another male friend who said he would never want to be with someone who had a body count higher than 5, because it shows how much someone values sex. That friend is very inexperienced by choice, he‚Äôs demisexual and a slow roller. 

Dude noooo I feel so stupid. I had a crazy phase as COVID eased up, I had just turned 18. I was also using sex to cope with some feelings, which I‚Äôve since learned from and will not do again. Now I feel so ashamed and regretful. Because the body count will be forever.  :(

1709104849.0,I'm eighteen and I already feel like my life might be ruined,"Hello everyone :) I‚Äôm aware this is quite a complicated thing to explain and English is not my first language so it may not make the most sense, so I am sorry if it doesn‚Äôt.

I am eighteen, and a couple of weeks ago, I married my husband. I was born into a more strict part of the Orthodox Church in Switzerland and this marriage between me and my husband, who is twenty five, had been planned by the leaders of the church and my parents since I was about sixteen. I was only told about it about a year ago, and I never had much choice in the matter. Because my husband was the son of one of the leaders of the church, my parents really wanted me to marry him.

The marriage to him was probably the worst time in my entire life. He did not like me at all and in his mind, my only purpose was to have as many children as possible and do everything he said. This meant he forced me into intercourse all the time, even though it really hurt me and when I‚Äôd say I didn‚Äôt really want to he‚Äôd hit me and yell at me. I tried to be a good wife and do what he wanted but I just felt I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore.

I was able to talk to someone at my university and they helped me leave. I‚Äôm still married to him but I want to try and have it annulled if I can. When I was able to leave about a week ago, I was able to stay in the dorms at school. I want to try and get a job and finish my degree so I can be able to have an independent future.

However, even though I thought my life was coming together, it got worse again. I had been having pains in my stomach, a bad headache and I was feeling sick a lot. I thought it was just anxiety and getting used to my new life but yesterday, I was in the worst pain of my life. I couldn‚Äôt stand up and kept vomiting and it was really horrible. Thankfully someone took me to the hospital and it turned out I had been pregnant, and it was ectopic. My fallopian tube had ruptured and it had to be removed through emergency surgery.

Although I‚Äôm relieved that they were able to resolve it, I feel really sad. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to live a life like people my age because everything I was told in my childhood, part of me still believes it. They‚Äôre trying to find me a therapist, but it‚Äôs difficult because of how complicated my childhood and life has been. Part of me still gets panicked being out in public because I was always told I‚Äôd get corrupted, even though I know now it isn't true. I want to be able to be like people my age and get my degree and be happy and normal but it‚Äôs really hard. I get scared of men now and I also feel guilty about what happened to the baby, like it was my fault. Although I feel happy that I‚Äôm not going to be stuck with him, I feel guilty for being happy because I basically killed a child and now I‚Äôm sort of missing half of an organ. I know there are not many people that have had a life like I have but I would really like to hear if anyone at all has any advice, no matter what your life has been like. Also about the surgery, it is a bit of an unusual one so I could not find a lot about what you can and can't do after it. Thank you so much <3",TwoXChromosomes

They are mourning the loss of their relationship, but they also really shit on being single. They hate their predicament and they hate that they're single. The project all of these limiting narratives and I just can't stand it. They way the treat singlehood is so condescending. 

I'm sorry your partnership is over. You're not worthless and neither am I. 

I know it's their issue, but it's just so old hat at this point.

On the flip side, people in unhappy marriages who complain to me: my husband doesn't do his fair share of domestic work! 

Cool - no one helps me do my domestic work either. You're already doing it by yourself, fucking figure it out or dump him. ",TwoXChromosomes
1709093545.0,How many of you have ever considered breaking up with someone based on looks?,"This has been coming up a lot on men's posts lately, and it blows my mind. Have you ever been in a relationship for over 1-2 years and considered ending it based off of weight gain, hair change, less working out, etc.? You stay with someone that long because you LIKE THEM not just because of how they look. Yes, everyone has preferences, but I mean...I would PREFER my husband to look like Brad Pitt, but I'm not going divorce him because I love him. What do these men think is going to happen when their wives/girlfriends age, that they will just find a new one? Even  situations where there is an imbalance that develops, two people that used to take a lot of care of themselves to one letting themselves go. My immediate thought would be to help them with what they are going through instead of just being like ""ew, why are you so lazy now?"" Am I the crazy one here? I would never consider breaking a relationship that long off over looks alone. Is it a generational thing, maybe?

He kept calling the judge's office every day for a court date, so I think they just did it fast to shut him up. We had filled out the paperwork not too long prior, but he said he wanted to give it another go. That didn't last long. He changed, got mad when I didn't change with him. I'm not going in to the whole thing again, but man, I am still angry. He wanted the divorce in the first place, he also wanted to ""make it work"", but he also didn't want to try anything other than me changing.

I had asked him to not sleep with other people until we were officially divorced. And goddamn, did he just bother the judge until we got a date. He called me frantically the other day saying that they could do it in 20 minutes over Zoom. So I had 20 minutes to put myself together and that was it. I am in the process of changing my name back to my REAL name again. I feel calmer, but I keep going through bouts of anger.

The first time it happened, I didn't think anything of it honestly. The dogs were in the other room, the guy texts me and stands there, and the dogs notice before I can respond. He dropped my food off pretty quickly then.

Today, the same thing, the guy texts that hes here, and I actually have time to respond to leave it at the door, and notice him just hanging around. I get up to move and that's when the dogs perked up, and there the guy goes.

Here is where I put the standard 'maybe I'm overreacting to how connected the weird behavior is related to me being a woman', but it doesn't change the fact that my dogs pull their weight in making me feel safe.

I had surgery on 1/31 to remove an ovarian cyst.  One big one (the dermoid which was causing pain issues), two smaller ones on my right ovary, and some endo.

First two days were great, then on Saturday night (three days post op) ended up in horrific pain, could not walk etc.  Went to the ER , they said constipation, gave me an edema; and sent me on my way. Even though I was still in horrific pain.

The pain continued on, was not able to walk, pooping was a nightmare, and the pain pills did not seem to be working.  My doctor, who could not get me in until March , assumes I also had some nerve damage.  So they put me on gabapentin.  It helped ,but something still did not feel right.  Was able to get into my doctor and got a steroid shot, this is what allowed me to start being mobile.

So I thought I was on the path to recovery, now 4 weeks post op, I‚Äôm in terrible pain again, my pooping is not normal.  I‚Äôm still taking Miralax and stool softeners as well as a high fiber diet.  I also go my period and my left side is killing me , to the point I‚Äôm considering going to the ER.  

It‚Äôs super frustrating.  I‚Äôm terribly disappointed in the doctors who continue to ignore me.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs nerve damage, my ovaries, I‚Äôm not contemplating if I have diverticulitis and it seems like the doctors continue to dismiss and not take my pain seriously.  

I‚Äôm sharing this because I was told this was supposed to be a super easy surgery, and I should be back on my feet in a week post-op, that is not the case for me , can‚Äôt help to question ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with me ‚Äú.  If anyone else is having a rough post -op know that you are not alone , and unfortunately women‚Äôs health care is years behind where it needs to be to properly support its patients.

Last found fact that I found strange through this entire experience , when they open my dermoid cyst , it was full of hair.  A cyst made up of hair was growing on my ovaries and my doctor shrugs it off like Nbd.  That‚Äôs not normal .

I passed out on the floor, kept trying to take my clothes off when I got up, was switching between languages and speaking gibberish, banging around and falling all over the place, etc. (and I got plenty of injuries to show for it) my parents, who were home, distinctly said that I was not drunk I was explicitly high, despite not taking anything myself.

 I think it was GHB and I think I know who did it, because one of the last things that happened before I blacked out was some random guy came up to me to compliment my karaoke singing, I blacked out a little later, and left the bar before it reached its full effect (if my memory is right I got drugged around or just after two, blacked out shortly later, and the bar would have closed at three (drinks are taken at 2:45) and GHB takes roughly 40 minutes to really get in the bloodstream/take full effect, which is why it would have really kicked in on my walk home/the bar staff didn't I had blacked out and caused all the other symptoms with delay + GHB doesn't give you a hangover so that's why I woke up feeling fine",TwoXChromosomes

People generally enter into relations with the reasonable expectation of mutual benefit. Why else would they consent to the relations? If two people consent to sex, they're consenting to mutual pleasure (unless otherwise specified). Women aren't consenting to be used as fleshlights.

So, why is it just socially accepted for men to do this over and over again? To use women's bodies as objects? Why is it just brushed off as an annoyance rather than called out for what it is: ab\*se.

I mean, if one person uses another for their own selfish desires in any other topic (financial, emotional, physical), we call that abuse. Unless it's enthusiastically consented to by both partners, of course.

It's one thing if both parties don't have the same understanding (covert bullshit or manipulation), or one becomes unable to fulfill their contract. Shit happens, and people can withdrawal consent at any time. But it's different to secretly plan to get in, get off, get out from the beginning, and not disclose this to the partner prior to sex. They don't, because they fear women wouldn't consent to sex. That's intentionally withholding information that consent hinges upon. And it's ab\*sive.

I have asd, but have also been dealing with possible co-morbid issues like adhd that have gone under the radar. I've become fed up with trying to deal with these challenges on my own so I finally am dipping my feet back into the water and trying therapy again after several years. The last therapist I had was not a good match for me.

The psychologist I spoke with was friendly, compassionate, and a good listener, but they had some interesting ideas that I strongly do not agree with. They said that autism is the next phase in human evolution. The moment they said this I felt uneasy and discouraged because this seemed like a break from reality to me. I have had some failed experiences with therapists in my teen years who also had some wild takes. I still genuinely have yet to meet a down to earth therapist with no bizarre ideas. One of those therapists back from when I was seventeen was homophobic. He told me that homosexuality was a fetish. I reported him to the front desk but I also never went back to therapy with him. :(

It has been really really hard for me to even attempt therapy because of these bad experiences. There's been more than one. It has made me feel like it's not possible to make the right choice and this is always going to be the outcome if I try doing therapy.

My rational mind knows there is nothing wrong with not wanting sex for whatever reason and altough we have spoken about it I never try to make him feel bad. But my emotional mind is screaming ""Am I not good enough?!"". I just really hate having these thoughts. Anybody can relate?

1709061338.0,I just want to exist without an expectation to fix other people,"I've come to a point in life where I'm finally able to pursue more things that make me happy rather than simply survive. Naturally, I've met lots of people and made new friends.  I mostly engage with people I have common interests with and, unlike my 20s, don't waste time on those I know I can't forge meaningful connections with. 

And boy has this angered some people, mostly men but some women too. 

I have been called intolerant because I don't give third and fourth chances to people who sit awkwardly and don't talk at social gatherings. I've been called mean because I have chosen to cut ties with women who did nothing when their husbands outwardly called me an asexual prude for rejecting their advances. And, of course, I have been called a ranging man-hating feminist for refusing to tolerate inappropriate touching. 

There seems to be this idea that I'm supposed to make my existence uncomfortable so some people get a chance to grow and become better humans. So many times I have been told to give men who have touched me inappropriately a second chance because 'they are just awkward and don't know how to behave but stopped when you told them to'. Like, NO! if someone has touched me inappropriately I am in no way obliged to ever look their way again even if they learned from their actions. 

I spent all of my 20s neglecting my needs just to appease other people and I got taken advantage of.  I am not here for people to practise being better partners and friends. My life is too precious to waste time on relationships that I know deep down will only hurt me. ",TwoXChromosomes
1709059647.0,First Job Interview After Layoff,"I (24F) got laid off about 3 weeks ago. I was a software developer, and had been with the company almost 2 years. It was my first job out of college. To be honest, I was contemplating leaving anyways. I was doing the tasking for myself, another coworker who slacked off, and handling my managers technical tasks he couldn't handle. Every time I got a major task, even if I was performing well, it was taken away and given to the same male coworker. I repeatedly asked my supervisor and HR if I was doing something wrong and they essentially said you're doing fantastic and we have no complaints or criticism. I was pretty underpaid for the industry and having a masters degree. I also was continously promised leadership opportunities and opportunities for new work, but guess what, they were repeatedly given to the same male coworker. I had a candid conversation with my supervisor approximately a week before my layoff. Regarding how the company treated me, he saw the same things I saw, so I think it wasn't just me. I had been passed up a promotion from junior to associate two weeks prior. The justification for laying me off was that they couldn't keep juniors on the project due to budget, eliminating only myself and the coworker who's work I handled. 

This company would be creating a position for me if they offered me a job, since I have a niche skill set they really need in their next project phase. I'm worried that if I don't do well and absolutely kill it, this ruins my chance since they'd be creating a position for me. I feel like I have to prove I'm worth the extra position and resources. Thankfully a friend of mine from college works at this company and is on the team I'm interviewing for. He filled out a formal referral and I'm so thankful.

1709059342.0,Broke up but still living together,"So I(31f) broke up with my fiance(31m)  a few nights ago. We are stuck living together for another 2 months, when our lease is up, and we have our 5 year old kid with us. I just feel weird now. But also guilty cus i know he (ex) is sad. Our son and I woke up to him loudly sobbing in the shower the morning after we broke up. 

I feel really empty, but also free. 

I keep feeling like I should be doing something, but I'm not sure what it is. The only real decision I have to make at this point is whether i should move in with my mom, move the 3 of us together to a LCOL area, which was our plan before we broke up, or if we should move to LCOL together but go our separate ways.

I hadn't planned to break up yet, we were supposed to get therapy and couples counseling, but I finally snapped and thinking of having to live with him once we move does not sit well with me. I'd like to have my own place, but even the Affordable housing in a LCOL in our state is just above what I can afford for rent. 

My only other option would be to stay in the same town and move myself and son in with my mom and ex can possibly find a roomate around here. 

There are some big negative factors if living with my mom-

- revolving door of boyfriends

- she is highly critical and judgmental of me

- she is extremely doting on my son, which is great but she shows favoritism with boys. It was always clear with my brothers, and now that my brothers only have daughters, i have the only boy and she often badmouths my neices, obviously showing preference for my son. Which is so wrong. 

- we have a rocky relationship, obvs. 

- She is would not be very open to me setting boundaries, which I wouldn't want to because we would be in HER home.

We do not know eachother, but I would like to get to know him if he is open to it. 

I think maybe a third perspective from strangers would be best. Is 8 years too much at this age? Would him being interested back be bad since I am so young? Like a bad look for him, should I be wary. Also, he does not know I am 20 so I know he would not approach me if he chose to because of my age (I know his age because of the store's instagram page, all the staff are tagged in a group pic and I took a peek at his insta I am not gonna lie).

1709055944.0,DAE feel like many men don't really value intelligent women anymore?,"Rewatching *Poor Things* and, in its brilliance, reminded me of a sad truth - see title: men, en masse, only really want women who are easily manipulated and who are ""innocent"" in the sense of being malleable and easily controlled. Every man in Bella Baxter's life loved her the most when she was literally infant-minded and only existed as a hyper-s3xual sponge, soaking up these guys' lust and *only* the knowledge that they themselves bestowed onto her.

This is an exaggerated story but it mirrors the reality for many women, especially in these days. Every man I've ever been with either cruelly negged me or insulted me, or they thought it was ""cute"" whenever I was clumsy or made errors, missteps, or otherwise exhibited some intelligence or knowledge that was ""lesser"" than his. It was only when I asserted myself in some way (exhibiting knowledge on something they didn't have, expressing an opinion different from theirs, etc) that these men lost interest in me and even displayed irritation toward me. In contrast, when I dumbed myself down, pretended not to be as intelligent as I actually am, acquiescing to their thoughts and opinions and wishes, that's when these same men were all over me. Damn near all of my female friends have had similar experiences with men!!

Every man I've been with has praised my ""receptiveness"" and ""submissiveness"", when deep down, I am anything but. In this day and age, especially, in the age of the ""tradwife"" and the ""red pill"" ideologies, it seems like one of the only courses of action to continually hold a man's attention. Even my parents have told me for as long as I can remember that ""it's important to be a little less intelligent or only just as intelligent as your man, never more; that's the only way it will work.

Now I believe that there's some truth in it, internalized misogyny is real and deep. Women are more harshly critized by both men and women, and the patriarchy has always put women beauty in the center of their lives. Women beauty standards are harsher, and I do believe that women may have more body and confidence issues, the biggest client in the makeup industry, shaving industry, plastic surgery industry, diet industry, fashion industry are women. It's a fact, and it's not only because people like doing that, it's because it's socially normalize and expected for a women to look a certain way.

Now my question is why do I never hear about men having confidence issues. Somehow, men are never jealous of each other, never talk badly to each other and obviously they always uplift each other. They never compare themselves to their extremely handsome, rich and charismatic friends. Contrary to the bitter women who are always ""so much drama"" and fake to each other.

I‚Äôve been going through a lot the last year but especially the last 4-5 months, and I‚Äôve been depressed and just extremely reckless.

I have informed the guy I fought with, because we did have an accident back in End of Nov / early Dec. but I was honest with him, in that I have dated others since, and that I will know more after tomorrow. He was respectful and just told me to let him know.

I want to state that although I felt off about the sexual contact it feels like I was out of control of myself, however there was no issue of consent.

Afterwards he checks his phone and he has a message from his brother asking ‚Äúlet me know when you are done with the slag‚Äù.

Today he dumped me because although we have a ‚Äúgreat connection‚Äù he just can‚Äôt see us ‚Äúbeing together forever‚Äù.

I was assaulted in the summer and it feels like every man since is just pummelling that trauma harder and harder. I know the solution is just stop dating, just stop seeing men, stop centring men, but the thing is I don‚Äôt want to stop dating men. I just want men to stop treating me like an object, to treat me with gentleness and kindness, to respect me. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I don‚Äôt want to believe that men are just all horrendous people but it feels like the only other answer is I am the problem. Like I am fun to hurt. I don‚Äôt know.

I just feel so exhausted. Therapy just makes me feel worse. I am not suicidal in an active planning way but I do wish I could just stop suffering even if it‚Äôs just for an hour.

EDIT: Just want to say thank to everyone who left comments, both kind words and advice. I‚Äôve read them all, and I want to respond to each individually but I feel conscious of spamming people or being annoying I suppose. I think what happened in summer clearly traumatised me (it‚Äôs a whole storytime tbh) more than I realised. I have also realised that I probably have experienced more incidents of SV since then, including from the man I describe in the op. Still processing that.

I am going to get a new therapist who specialises in sexual trauma, and I‚Äôve deleted all the dating apps. I am not going to be menu item for empathy bereft men anymore. I‚Äôm taking myself out for a nice dinner tonight because maybe if I do it enough times I‚Äôll believe I deserve it. I hope you all can do something nice for yourself too.

1709028537.0,"One month post break up, rereading last years journal and its a wild ride","Hi all.

Firstly, I came here a few weeks ago to get the final push to leave my ex and you all validated me and helped me a lot! Once I'd made the decision I immediately felt happy and relieved, and have continued to be everyday since. We were long distance so it was a clean break. My chronic illness has even been improving. So thank you all! 

Now last night I wrote in my journal and decided to have a look at the past entries which I rarely do. I didn't write much last year due to chronic fatigue onset. But yes, crazy.

Entries from January 2023, I felt completely smothered. We argued all the time. He was emotionally reactive so a small thing could set him off. I had told him he couldn't raise his voice or be mean to me anymore, so occasionally he switched to good old fashioned stonewalling. He was unemployed and I was working and commuting, but he was upset I didn't contact him enough. I tried to break up at one point but felt quilted out of it.

February 2023, one day he he called me and pushed me to decide on dates and book the Cape Town trip we had been planning. So I did, it took 2 days but I booked off work and paid for the ticket. I didn't write this down but that evening or later that day he told me he had found (went looking for) my reddit account and read the whole thing. Looking back now I realise how manipulative that is, he got me to book the trip because he knew cancelling it would be a pain so probably I would look past the huge invasion of privacy. It worked.

The trip was in March. It was lovely. The thing about my ex, the dude is so good looking and charming. And sweet when he wants to be. Strangers love him. Still, we hadn't sorted out our differences. He wanted to continue like nothing wrong was happening. I begged for a break so we could both work on ourselves. He agree but 2 days later blocked me on everything, it set off my anxious attachment and I was sobbing. When I got through to him I basically convinced him to keep trying and said we could give up on the break (he'd agreed to a break but privately thought fuck her I guess).

April 2023, I start writing by writing about how he is the most wonderful person in the world. I wrote multiple entries about how we are still disagreeing and I still feel really uneast about certain things but I keep writing

'I need to be okay with it'
'If he doesn't meet me where I'm at I need to accept it'
'I need to give him more grace'

I kind of stop writing after that, if I continued I'm sure there would be many entries about how when he did get a job there would be days I wouldn't hear from him, or how not understanding he was about my illness. He was supposed to move to the UK but shortly after April he decided he was too anxious about being unhappy here, so defacto it started to seem I had to give up my whole life to move to his country and have no less than 3 kids there. I should have left him then but I kept telling myself to have faith, have grace, commit.

The journals really made the see the mental gymnastics I was going through. I believe part of me knew for years this relationship was bad since I did try to break up a few times, but I guess I convinced myself. I mean, HE was so sure he was a decent boyfriend. HE was so sure he was a good person. Obviously, I wasn't perfect, but I wasn't mean or stonewalling or argumentative. That stuff broke me down over a long period of time.

1709022684.0,Why does every guy I‚Äôm romantically interested in feel inclined to note my skin colour??,"It‚Äôs so weird being analysed in such an inspective way based on my skin tone. I can‚Äôt simply be Mexican to many men of different races, or lighter complexion. Instead they feel inclined to point out ‚Äúyour skin is dark. You‚Äôre more like Chilean. Maybe you‚Äôre Native American??‚Äù or ‚Äú*insert anything other than you said you are because you don‚Äôt fit that wholly stereotypical description when I Google your race*‚Äù This comes more so from American men which baffles me. And might be another topic to discuss entirely with the American fascination with race in appearance. Be it skin colour, facial features, etc. 

But back to the topic at hand:

Considering I long had body dysmoprhia for years and counting, and that I really would like to be more than my looks or my dark skin tone, it drives me mad when I get such needless feedback as if I need to truly consider where I came from because of how dark my skin tone is. Or because of my facial features. Even having been told I have Indian ancestry because of my eye shape. Like??? This is always after I quickly mention my family history which is important to me. I never mention appearance or otherwise, just traditions and customs. 

Let me preface that they don‚Äôt mean this in a negative sense, they make an open observation, but even still it‚Äôs so fucking weird. Imagine going ‚Äúhmmm. You‚Äôre too light/dark. You‚Äôre definitely not truly your race.. maybe you‚Äôre this instead‚Äù- Why pray tell does it even matter to the point of pointing me in the direction of a country or people who aren‚Äôt mine?? I don‚Äôt think they understand how actually weird it is, not to mention in some places I was told by my own people as well I‚Äôm not one of them. 

This is mostly a vent. But I‚Äôm also generally just confounded with this instant reaction to make sure I know I don‚Äôt fit the stereotype. I‚Äôm just tired of this reaction from white men or generally just men who are very light in complexion. I just want to be a person first and foremost and not a case to be studied because my skin colour is odd and dark.

I was about 6 inches from him and was too embarrassed to say anything, especially due to his disability. 

However, after remembering this, I‚Äôve been feeling weird and emotional. I know that he likely had no situational awareness/mal intent but every time I think about it I want to cry.

When the waitress walked over with a salad, no one claimed it for a moment, so the random guy next to me pointed my way and said it was probably mine. Then after a beat, his buddy realized what was happening and said it belonged to him. I laughed pretty hard and said ""you really tried it, huh?""

Most recently, we were sitting at the bar and saw MTV was playing an old Usher song, so we started joking about actually seeing music videos on TV. The guy next to us starts joking along, but it quickly turns into complaints about Taylor Swift at the chiefs games. Then he said that I *must be* a Swiftie. No hate at all to Taylor, but her music just hasn't been my vibe. My husband jumped in and started talking about how my music taste is pretty eclectic.

I think I‚Äôve always had this issue but early in the relationship I assumed it was because I was new to sex, and it‚Äôs likely gotten worse because it‚Äôs hard for me to want sex/get turned on when I know I‚Äôm going to be in pain. Essentially, penetration is the most painful (after about 2 minutes it starts to feel almost like a burning sensation and after intercourse it takes hours for the pain to go away) but also external stimulation and orgasms can be uncomfortable. As for the orgasms, they can be painful because 80% of the time I experience strong vaginal cramps when they occur, akin to period cramps. I really enjoy making my partner feel good and thats enough to give me pleasure, but I get so frustrated that he gets to enjoy it so much when I basically have to grit my teeth the whole time due to the discomfort.

 a lot of what I‚Äôve seen in real life is more like a man acting good long enough to cement himself into a woman‚Äôs life and then either gradually doing less and less and starting to half ass chores he‚Äôs asked to do, or once he‚Äôs gotten to a place where getting rid of him would be difficult, like after kids, he switches to open misogyny and refusal to help. 

If you‚Äôve been in a relationship that ended over a man being unwilling to help around the house, or becoming lazy over time, would you mind sharing how the laziness/refusal started and what made you eventually realize it had gone too far?

I said man in the post but if you were with a woman you‚Äôre welcome to share. I just feel so confused when I read stories about these people because it seems like in order to get their partner to accept their behavior they must have had a strategy to be appealing at first.

A video of a chick wearing skimpy clothes and showing off to a guy popped up. The account was a promotion for her OF. I immediately thought ‚ÄúI guarantee it‚Äôs just going to be a cesspool in the comments‚Äù and I was right. 

But one thing got me. There were multiple comments saying something like ‚ÄúWhen pretty much half the women in the west do porn this is what you get‚Äù and then of course like 2k likes and hundreds of replies per comment from guys being like ‚ÄúTrue. And they tell us not to objectify them‚Äù.

While it could have been hyperbole. The fact that a lot of people think that a lot of women do sexual content is bananas. This just proves that these dudes who seriously think this stuff are just porn addicted and angry for being so weak. They have no idea what the average woman does in life because they have no contact with them.

I looked it up and there are 2.1 million creators on OF. If we are just talking about women in the US, there are approximately 167.5 million of us and ~65,080,000 adult women. And there are ~22,000 pro porn stars in the industry from the US. That‚Äôs like 3.3 something percent of the female population in the US. That‚Äôs not even accounting for the men that do OF content, or content creators from different countries.

The average income of an OF creator is $158.00 a month. Not only is this narrative of ‚Äúall girls have to do is porn and they‚Äôre rich‚Äù but also this idea that ‚Äúso many women do porn now‚Äù.

Anyway, that‚Äôs my rant. And just to clarify, this is no shade towards sex workers. I‚Äôm mainly just astounded that any group of people would believe that a half or even a quarter of women do sex work.",TwoXChromosomes

I live with two roommates, both cis women. We contribute on an as-needed, rotating basis for communal supplies like toilet paper. 

I do not menstruate. I take birth control continuously to avoid periods because PMDD/endometriosis-level symptoms (never diagnosed with the latter because birth control worked for me and I tolerate my meds well).

I say of course and snag some of the good stuff at Rite Aid. By Thursday evening, the entire roll is almost gone. A pile of what I assume are blood soaked tampons and cleanup are in the trash can. These are wrapped maybe 5 times over.

1708987889.0,"Left my abusive ex, moved countries, built a new life and I am so proud of myself for that. ","Trigger warning: SA, Stalking

I was just thinking of how far I have come and I decided to vent. English is my second language, so sorry if i am not too clear at times. 
Me (27F) and my ex(27m) were together for 10 years, from when we were 13. It started out as a school girl crush and it evolved. 
I did not know what ""negging"" was then. He used to constantly point out other women and the imperfections i have compared to them. He would get insanely jealous if i did better at studies. I was good at it but he couldn't stand it. I hated everything about my body and myself. I was scared and tried to ""dumb down"" for him. I dont even know why. I judge myself for that, but i try not to be too harsh on myself anymore for it. 
I finally got the courage to break up with him one day. It took 10 years. We were supposed to get engaged, i come from a conservative country and a lot of our elders weren't too happy. But my mother supported me which meant a lot to me, she said she just wanted me to be happy and she will be there no matter what. 
So i was done and i told him. His behaviour changed. He was ultra nice to me all of a sudden. I still had sex with him a few times, not because i loved him, but because he had me convinced noone else will ever find me attractive and he was doing me a favour. And he was the only man i had ever been with, i was scared. 
I then decided to work on myself. I managed to get full scholarship and moved abroad to pursue my studies. I started meeting people and I started realising people did find me attractive. I realised what he had done, what ""negging"" means. My self esteem started growing. 
After some time I went back home to visit for a month and met our mutual friends, he was also there. He realised I was not in his ""control"" anymore and I know my worth, he ended up SAing me. He also started stalking me. I was terrified. 
I came back to the country i am pursuing my studies in, i blocked him everywhere and I  blocked anyone who I thought was on his side, and worked on moving on. I got help from womens charity services and did counselling. I made new friends in this new country. I realised people like me and think i am interesting. 
Fast forward to now, I met a nice guy who cheers and hypes me up. I was terrified of a relationship again but his tender behaviour touches me. I am terrified of sex after the SA and i need time. He says he will wait as long as i want, he doesnt care, he just wants to be with me. He actually keeps his word. Its such a change. I am also getting my PhD this summer and i will be a doctorate soon. Everything worked out and I just want to hug my old self and tell her everything will be okay. ‚ù§

TLDR: I got the courage to leave my abusive ex who used to neg me, he couldnt handle it and sa-ed me, i got scholarship and left the country, worked on myself, found someone who restores faith in love,  about to get my PhD and  i am doing so much better. ",TwoXChromosomes

1708987315.0,So sick of the narrative that women having hair down there is gross. ,"I used to shave down there all the time as a teen, basically every day. I was constantly ravaged with sore ingrown hairs and chaffing and honestly hated shaving so much but I kept doing it, because I was taught that hair down there was embarrassing and gross. 

I‚Äôm 22 now, and gave up fully shaving down there probably three years ago at this point. I like to trim it and shave along my bikini line occasionally, but I haven‚Äôt fully shaved my mound in probably over a year. I was in a long term relationship and he said he didn‚Äôt mind the hair at the top, but would prefer if I shaved lower, so I did. And I don‚Äôt mind doing that. But when we broke up and I started seeing other people I got SO anxious about my hair down there again. One guy I slept with was completely turned off by it. He was 24. Basically a grown adult. Grossed out by pubic hair. I actually scoff at the thought of that. 

I see posts about it on social media and the comments are full of people saying having hair down there is gross and unhygienic and causes bacterial growth and odour, but as someone who has dealt with recurrent yeast infections my entire life, they only started happening when I started shaving as a teen, and still only happen when I shave down there. And of course I‚Äôm not denying having lots of hair can get gross down there, but it also gets gross if you don‚Äôt have hair. That‚Äôs just called being unhygienic. Anyone who has hair or not can be gross if they don‚Äôt wash themselves properly. If hair is gross then are men who have body hair all over their chests and back and ass automatically gross?? No? I didn‚Äôt think so. 

If you‚Äôre in your twenties and still think that pubic hair is gross, it‚Äôs time to grow up. Humans are given hair for a reason, it protects the most vulnerable organ women have, and western culture saying women need to be completely hairless at all times is driving me insane. It‚Äôs a gross standard edging on creepy if anything. I finally found someone who actually likes my hair. All of it, lips, mound, legs. He said I completely changed his mind towards body hair and actually encourages me to grow it out, however he is very much ‚ÄúI love whatever makes you the most comfortable, hairy or not.‚Äù He‚Äôs appreciated me more than anybody else and has allowed me to love and embrace my body, hairy legs, pussy and all.

Doctors comments:
Here are the results of your cervical biopsies for your records. Your cervical biopsy showed low-grade changes to the cervical cells. They could not rule out high-grade changes in one of the biopsies. We can consider repeat colposcopy with a biopsy again in that area. We could also proceed with the procedure to remove a portion of the cervix, although that may not be necessary if there are not high-grade changes of the cells. This would be done in the operating room under anesthesia. You could also consider repeat Pap smear in 6 months, although, if it is high-grade changes to the cervical cells those could worsen. Let me know how you would like to proceed, and we can have a telemedicine visit to discuss options in depth if you would like.

My reply:
Thank you for explaining the results. I think I feel comfortable and want to wait and re-test in 6 months

Okay, as I mentioned, the risk of waiting would be that this is a high-grade lesion that could progress.  I would give the office a call now to schedule a repeat Pap smear and colposcopy in 6 months‚Ä¶

It was overall ok, but I couldn‚Äôt not notice that I felt a bit awkward at some of her comments or reactions. As this was the first time I‚Äôve ever had this type of therapy session, I‚Äôd like to ask for your opinions. 

First, just for context: my husband has been doing sessions with this sexologist for about a month, and last week he asked me to join the next session (which was today), so she could also talk to me. As I said some things made me feel odd:

The first thing was to suggest that we should have sex at least 15 times a month. This one I couldn‚Äôt really understand if it was a ‚Äújoke‚Äù or just a form of exaggerate to emphasize that we need to ‚Äúup our game‚Äù. 

The second thing was the way she reacted to my reaction. So, my husband was saying that he‚Äôs currently not happy with the frequency that we have sex, and if it continues to go on he would probably not be able to be together with me anymore. Then she asked me how I felt about it, and I said I understood him. Then, she gasped and looked so surprised, she had to ask if it meant I didn‚Äôt care about what he just said. Then I told her that ‚Äúof course not, I just understand where he‚Äôs coming from, and I love him, so of course it‚Äôs sad for me to hear this.‚Äù. I felt so awkward at this point‚Ä¶ 

The third thing was that, after the second ‚Äúred flag‚Äù, she was *constantly* repeating that ‚Äúone can find excuses for everything, but not everything is fixable‚Äù, referring to what my husband said earlier about not being happy with our sex life and that it could potentially end in a divorce if nothing changes. This was again very weird. I felt like it should not be her role to tell me this, but my husband‚Äôs.

I told my husband how I felt after the therapy and he said he understood but he didn‚Äôt feel it was awkward. Am I over exaggerating? Have you experienced something similar? If so, what did you do?

So, I started getting sexually active at 18, but even before then, I'd already learned how to masturbate from watching porn. That kinda led me into this routine of relying on porn and toys pretty often. There were only a couple of times I managed to get off without porn‚Äîone time solo and another during sex through clitoral stimulation. Both times, I had to really let my imagination dive into some porn scenes I remembered, and reaching orgasm wasn't exactly easy.

Now I'm 25, and it's almost second nature to use toys with my partners or turn to porn when I'm flying solo and don't have a toy handy.

Here's the thing‚ÄîI kinda feel broken (yeah, you've probably heard that one before), mainly because my partners put in a ton of effort to get me there, but always seem to think they're in a losing battle with the toys, which makes them feel inadequate.

In my last relationship, I was in a poly V, and we'd have threesomes occasionally. The other woman could climax from PIV no problem, but I'd be there needing my toy to even get close to an orgasm.

One day, my then-boyfriend opened up about feeling less of a man when he couldn't get me there, which just made me compare myself to the other woman and left me feeling pretty low.

It's been about a year, and I'm lying awake tonight, worrying I might never make a man feel ""manly"" enough.

So, I've decided to cut out porn and take a break from the toys, hoping to eventually reconnect with myself and find joy in my body without all the extra stuff.

Imagine that!‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes I would ask you to help with the laundry from time to time and what‚Äôs wrong about that ?‚Äù 

Then he said ‚Äúyou want me to clean my bathroom and my side of the toilet, and then you mop and I vacuum and then you know he said I‚Äôll be roommates‚Äù I said ‚Äúno that is the best living arrangement you have a bathroom on that side of the house I have my bathroom we can both clean our bathrooms I don‚Äôt understand. What is the problem is‚Äù he said ‚Äú what do you think my mum would feel if she came here right now and so me doing dishes?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI would hope she would be fine. I don‚Äôt see the issue with that‚Äù he then went to say that ‚ÄúI am not wife material and that he deserves somebody who can listen to him and do all these things for him.

He said I‚Äôm not the man that you want or need and you‚Äôre not the girl I want and this is the end of our conversation. Then proceeded to say that he‚Äôs going to regret this, but he‚Äôs doing what needs to be done.Just gaslighting everywhere. Itwas a lot louder than it seems here very explosive I went off because I was like that is some sexist BS honestly and yeah he went and started packing his clothes because he actually leaves with me in my house for the last nine months.

EDIT: He is still here. He said he needs a couple days to figure out where he is going. I literally have no energy to engage with him. He has come several times to my room knocking saying he wants to talk. Not interested. Now he texts saying he wants to clear the air. I‚Äôm very hurt by his selfish behaviour but I really don‚Äôt want to listen to him talk about how he‚Äôs doing what‚Äôs best and I gave him no choice but to leave. It‚Äôs always my fault somehow. 

He just now came to my room. He has a court date tomorrow morning and wants to do a house inspection. He doesn‚Äôt have a car atm. He comes and says ‚ÄúI need your help for tomorrow I have court and I want to do an inspection‚Äù I told him ‚Äúyou made it very clear you want me out of your life so just sort yourself out‚Äù He goes ‚Äúso this is your revenge? I don‚Äôt have a way of getting there. You would prefer if I had used you till after court?‚Äù Like wtf? I said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre no longer my concern‚Äù He walked out. ",TwoXChromosomes

I‚Äôm at university studying engineering, there‚Äôs like 3 girls in my class including me in a class of about 35. The professor has kind of been picking on me lately, specifically calling me out by name and asking if I‚Äôm paying attention and stuff, even when it‚Äôs been obvious I‚Äôm writing notes and listening to the lecture as best I can. Today he randomly called me out in front of everybody, asking ‚Äú[name], are you paying attention or are you thinking about your boyfriend right now?‚Äù Like what the hell, I don‚Äôt even have a boyfriend, and again I was actively listening to the lecture, paying attention and taking notes so there was no reason to even call me out. 

He would never say this kind of thing to a guy. Sometimes he calls out the guys randomly but it‚Äôs never this, it‚Äôs just asking if they understand or have any questions. I present myself in a very feminine way, I‚Äôve never been the type to try and be masculine to try to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with the guys.

1708978729.0,What songs did you realize are sexist or normalize unhealthy or creepy relationship behavior? TW for lyrics,"At some point I realized that I was singing along to some pretty toxic stuff that I would not want to normalize expectations for interactions between genders or relationships between anybody. I want to say that this has gotten better over time, but I really don't know that it has. It seems like stalking and objectifying and being creepy are just about as common as they ever were, though I do think there's less that's openly predatory toward children, like in Gary Puckett's ""Young girl""

    Young girl
    Get out of my mind 
    My love for you is way out of line
    Better run, girl
    You're much too young, girl 

Some of the songs that get airplay or show up when streaming are blatantly toxic like Eminem's ""Kim"", where he says

    Sit down bitch!
    If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you
    Don't make me wake this baby!
    She don't need to see what I'm about to do!
    Quit crying, bitch!
    Why do you always make me shout at you? (etc)

but a lot of it is less straightforward, like Sarah McLachlan's ""Possession"", even though she put it right in the title and sings 

    Nothing stands between us here
    and I won't be denied
    and I would be the one
    to hold you down, 
    kiss you so hard, 
    I'll take your breath away
    and after I'd wipe away the tears, 
    just close your eyes dear 

So what songs do you see as problematic, and will you quote some of the lyrics here to show people who don't know the song? Do you ever talk with friends about how they, or pop culture generally, affect how we develop our expectations around relationships? How do you feel about kids hearing these, like do you switch to Disney radio when you have kids in your car/home? Do you think record companies, broadcasters, or streaming platforms have any responsibility to limit these in any way?

Very interested to see your takes on this, because I don't see much conversation about popular music and how it affects us, outside of the occasional talk about R. Kelly or whomever is the latest source of brutal drama or occasional praise for female role models in the industry.",TwoXChromosomes

1708976019.0,Ex completely destroyed my self-esteem,"Hi ladies. I just wanted to make a vent post because this is something that has been bothering me for the last 2 years, and I'm still struggling to move past it. I started ""dating"" this guy about 2 years ago, and he completely ruined my self-esteem.  
 
90% of the relationship was bad, if I'm being honest, but I'll only list the worst things that happened. It started out with him poking fun at my nose (I have a small bump on the bridge of my nose), then escalated to him making fun of my weight, even though I was struggling with my weight at the time and was only 50kg. When he took me to meet his family for the first time, he allowed his brothers to make fun of me as well. The entire weekend was basically them just pointing out my flaws and making jokes about them.  
 
The most painful part, by far, was the way he ended it. We waited a while before being intimate, and he broke up with me the day after we had sex for the first time. I can't help but think it was because he didn't like my body. He and his friends had a porn group chat, and all of the videos they would share had skinny blonde girls in them. So, I assume that was his actual type, which is the exact opposite of what I am.  
 
He knew all these things about me before he even started pursuing me, so I'm not sure why he even started seeing me in the first place. I also had to beg him to remove the pictures of him and his ex on Instagram, but he only archived them and put them right back up the day we broke up.  
 
If you've made it this far, you're probably wondering why I even allowed all of this to happen in the first place, and the truth is, I'm not even sure why. I'm crying while typing this out because it's so horrendously embarrassing. I guess in the moment, the mistreatment didn't feel as bad because I craved his approval. Now I'm realizing that the whole ordeal has caused me a lot of trauma and body image issues. I haven't been intimate with anyone since, and I sabotage any new relationship that starts to develop. 
 
I'm hoping someone here has possibly dealt with something similar and could share some advice. Also, sorry for the long rant.¬†",TwoXChromosomes

To cut a long story short I have a few health conditions pcos and hashimotos but I started getting bleeding after sex and multiple inbetween period bleeds. I went to my gp who said she thought it was down to my pill causing ectropian. 

I was seen by gyno, looked okay just follicles but sent for an ultrasound and colposcopy to be sure.

Ultrasound came back fine. Went for my colposcopy Thursday they didn‚Äôt expect to see anything just to tick box. Took a complete turn she could see mild and moderate abnormalities. Didn‚Äôt show me the screen took a biopsy and the whole thing was a little traumatic because I was not expecting any of it.

There was three women one was trying to calm me down after as I went faint and lost hearing I think from the shock then explained what was just done.

My last smear was clear nothing. I‚Äôm struggling to understand what‚Äôs just happened and how. Sorry I don‚Äôt know what to expect and don‚Äôt know where to look online. Has anyone had this experience of unexpected? Am I overthinking this?

1708969336.0,Why does monogamy have a monopoly on relationships? ,"I was raised in a religious household. So my views on men and women and the ‚Äòroles‚Äô they play in a romantic relationship were fucked from the start. 

By the time my 20s came around I started to question, more deeply, these roles. I had always been a curious kid, as a lot of people are but felt my curiosity taken as offense and ‚Äòjust being difficult‚Äô from people I‚Äôd ask. I didn‚Äôt understand why merely asking *why* you have to date, get married and have kids, was taken as offense. 

Now in my 30s it seems impossible to have these kinds of talks w/o ppl thinking I‚Äôm some extreme liberal with an ‚Äòagenda‚Äô. I remember vividly being taught in school, people would be different than you in the real world. Different religions, cultures and languages. But when ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô comes knocking at the door, it‚Äôs slammed in your face before you can get another word out.

To me, monogamy is just as natural as not being monogamous. But monogamy has become the default to the point of extreme criticism if you choose otherwise. The obvious thing to do is ignore those who are judgmental and the like. But my god it‚Äôs brutal. You feel ostracized and alone which in a way, is ‚Äòunnatural‚Äô for humans.

1708961840.0,Ethical Porn,"TW; sexual assault, abuse

Background:  
I'm looking for advice/perspectives. I'm too nervous to ask my friends. My partner and I had conflict yesterday regarding sex. It has been a struggle for awhile. I have multiple instances of sexual assault including a couple issues of consent dropping mid-sexual encounter and that not being respected with my current partner. We do a lot of work to understand the boundaries of physical intimacy and tune into the ""conversation"" that is happening when things do heat up. I'm not going to get into all the work we have done together to get past our issue. He has been understanding, apologetic and patient for the most part. On my part I am working almost every day to get through my trauma and come to a position where I'm empowered during sex. I state the boundaries of the encounter before it begins and I am vocal throughout about changes in that. IE; nothing penetrative, just touching/grinding or do not reach under my clothing, etc.  He seems very nervous when we have sex, it feels like he suddenly has forgotten how to please a woman although this was not a problem when we entered the relationship. On top of this there are issues with sensitivity, being able to last for a longer amount of time for what is basically just a giant foreplay session anyhow. We've talked about it a number of times. I have insisted that a part of the problem is that he does not masturbate if I am in the house. He seems uncomfortable exploring his own pleasure when I'm around.   


The conflict:  
Things fizzled out and ended not long after they began. He basically seemed too nervous to participate very much and what resulted was just.. disappointing... silent.. Not enjoyable for me and after 15 minutes of trying to tend to the insecurity and be encouraging I put my clothes on and layed beside him for the debrief. He was upset, there was crying. There was talk of his confidence being shot  and being too sensitive to get into it for fear of finishing too early. I laid with this man for 30 minutes talking to him about this and again reiterated that he should take more time to take care of himself, even if I am home. He has needs that are not being met by our frequency and there seems to be confusion about who owns his pleasure; It should be him. He should be responsible for his own pleasure, not waiting for me to take care of it. I did not discuss my disappointment in the interaction, I focused on him. After silence fell, not wanting to continue to dwell, I got up from the bed and began to start cleaning the house and making something to eat. 5 minutes later he came down in a huff and said ""I want to talk about ethical porn."" I was shook. We have agreed on a no-porn policy. I see it as largely exploitive to women with no way to suss-out what is and isn't. There is some trauma history I have when I was young where my mother would discover my father had been watching porn and go on a drunken rage about it all night. Whether or not porn is actually a threat to my relationship, I cannot shake a feeling in my core that it is. I had provided over the years 40+ photos of me that he recently lost due to an issue with his phone. I guess I thought he'd ask me first if I could make more but instead he comes down to tell me what he really needs to gain control of his sexuality is to watch some other woman get railed. I was livid and my words were not kind. I've been upset about the interaction all day. 

The Solution?  
I see his point. I see that he is saying he would like a visual stimulation to help him tune into his pleasure and maybe help distract him from his anxieties. I see that my rule about not having porn is blocking his own empowerment to look for something. This morning I wake with a heaviness in my heart. I don't want to take new pictures for this man who has disrespected me and left me nothing to fantasize over. I still don't want to be in charge of this man's pleasure. I think the compromise I am finding is to give him a playlist of music videos as acceptable materials. Women in positions of power, expressing themselves sexually through dance, music.. etc. It just feels better to me, and I have no hang-ups about him thinking Shakira or Beyonc√© are goddesses of sexuality from which to draw pleasure from. Straight up, me too. My question is.. am I finding a solution here? Am I going to feel later I've made a mistake and feel jealous over the music videos I/we choose for him? I don't want to give a green light that will hurt me later.. I am open to any advice, perspectives etc. I know this is a sensitive issue.. I'm just so lost this morning with feelings of worthlessness after working so hard to get through my trauma.

1708958016.0,Can we save marriage?,"I posted this response on another thread.  It just seems to me that there is so much wrong with marriage as an institution.  There is so much exploitation built in, and governments rely on the free labor of women weakened by marriage and motherhood.

We, as members of a supposedly free society, shouldn't want women weakened by marriage and childbirth.

But this was my original response:

""When you get married young, nearly every decision you've made as an adult has been made with another person considered and consulted.  Certainly, all the major decisions.  That's marriage.

And when you become a financially dependent SAHM you realize that your perspective on decision-making in marriage was colored by your experience as a woman and what you learned from older women in your life.  Because now that shit is set in fucking concrete.  And that's what the older women were preparing you for because that's how it was for them.

Before, you were being a considerate partner in consulting your partner on most decisions.  After kids, while at home with them, with the income-earning power imbalance thrown into stark relief, ""consideration"" becomes not rocking the boat because you and the kids are financially vulnerable.

It doesn't matter if you have a solid marriage and your partner contributes at home and gives you space as a person outside of motherhood.  BECAUSE THEY ARE *GIVING* YOU SPACE.  They can graciously give from their position of power.  If you take space for yourself, you are a bad wife and mother.

They can fuck off and take all the space in the world because they have a job and a salary.  They haven't lost income potential and marketable skills.  They may be seen as assholes, but I doubt that bothers them much.  They escaped because they could.  If they don't do that because they are decent people and love you, that's wonderful.  But traditional marriage is set up - in secular law, as well as religious - to give one partner (the breadwinner, usually the man) the whip hand in the relationship.

Most women aren't seeking new fuck buddies (Edit for clarity: In leaving partners for a seeming ""mid-life crisis,"" most women aren't seeking new fuck buddies.)  They want liberation.

Marriage does not have to be like this legally.  Pregnancy and childbirth don't have to be as perilous.  Motherhood shouldn't mean relying on a partner to keep you out of poverty.  There should be a national childcare policy and system.  Primary caregiving shouldn't mean you aren't accruing retirement benefits, particularly if you are stuck doing it most of your life for disabled children who become disabled adults and your parents or elderly relatives.

Marriage is designed for that religion-based subservient relationship.  It is also almost perfectly designed to kill a woman's love and respect for herself and her partner, and it's a miracle when love survives.  You both, obviously, did some hard work to make that happen.  Marriage needs a redesign to give that miracle more of a chance.

But men and women are already skipping out on marriage entirely now.  Men because they can't get the deal their grandfathers had: a bang maid who couldn't say or do shit if their husband treated them badly.  Women because marriage takes away their power and financial security.""

How do we get feminism back on track to deal with the core reason women are oppressed and are able to be oppressed:  our biological ability to gestate, birth, and nourish children?

Rich women can buy their way out of a lot of the oppression.  Child-free women can dodge a lot of the oppression specifically targeted at mothers.  Unmarried and child-free women can avoid even more of the oppression. (Shout out to Asian feminists leading the charge in choosing this path as a political movement.)

Most of the women in these groups have the free time to be active feminists.  But can they really speak to the core of women's oppression?  Where are cis hetero marriage and motherhood in our intersectionality?  Because those are still the dominant paradigms and, unfortunately, not being cis hetero doesn't get you out from under all of the bullshit that is baked into those cultural expectations and legal limitations. 

Representation in traditional male spheres of influence is not enough.

We need to find ways to protect and empower women within the dominant framework of marriage and motherhood.  That is what the fight against access to abortion and birth control is all about: trapping women in a position we have set up to make women powerless.",TwoXChromosomes

Hii!

This is a throw away account because I dont want to get doxed in any sense.

I (20) recently started seeing someone (20) I've met during my cat prep journey. Good lord this guy is a walking green carpet. I mean ughh- all boxes ticked (well, most). We recently started to get intimate after our fourth date. Everything was so dreamy until the main ahem \*deed\*. It was the first time for him, not for me. Well - i dont know how many of you will come at me for this but - the \*size\* is quite on the average side. I could see him getting embarrassed about it. As someone who has had her fair share of good, really good, soul shattering piv orgasms, I dont know how to go about this. He did go down on me but was average, not really really good. What is guilt tripping me is that he is accepting his flaws / vulnerability and says will make efforts to get better.

I am stuck midway. I do not want to hurt him. I know it is something largely out of his hands. But do I make peace with it for all my life? I am lost because he's great at all things otherwise - attraction, communication, understanding. And I did enjoy the intimacy but what is cross questioning my head is that it wasnt GREAT GREAT, ykwim? I hate to say it but somehow the comparison is making me uhm double check my thoughts?

Despite of this I've never cared because I've always taken care of myself and my body, I'm at a healthy weight and generally speaking, I feel good .

Well, for some time my self esteem has really deteriorated since I'm noticing more and more men who prefer girls with shapes, no matter what platform they're on. I made a mistake and looked things up on reddit, and a lot of guys admitted that they are attracted to curvy women. This thing obviously started to affect my self-esteem in a way that I feel like I'mdevastated.

I don't have a lot of experience in dating, but I remember when I was seeing a guy and because I was curious I looked at his following list on Instagram, which was full of girls who were curvy, sometimes giving me the impression that they were fake. I started to feel very bad and started to cry. I talked about it with my mother and she answered me with ""that's how most men are, obsessed with butts and boobs "".

another thing that discourages me deeply are porn movies. I watch them too, but I can't help but notice that whenever I access a porn site I always see videos with girls that have big boobs and asses, those videos happen to have most views.

so, how the hell do you love yourself as a flat girl when you live in a world that puts so much pressure on the way you look, especially when you don't fit the beauty standards at all ?

a logical answer would be to go to the gym and grow my ass, get some fake boobs on me, but I want to love myself AS I am, which is extremely difficult these days. thanks for the answers and advice, forgive my mistakes because english isn't my first language",TwoXChromosomes
1708947721.0,Looking for advice or someone who can relate ,"Just need some kind advice

Hi all,

I am a young lady recently in a new relationship. I would like to mention beforehand that yes I am a bit hard on myself and sometimes do have insecurities regarding my looks. But I just need some kind words of advice or people who relate to what I am feeling in this moment.
In my new relationship, the guy I am with is extremely understanding and really caring. I feel really supported by him.
There have been a few instances which sometimes bothered me and I have tried to just address them head on instead of keeping them in my mind and going crazy. I will just listen them down here and please do let me know if I sound crazy.
1. While travelling to some place, I have seen him look at other women for a bit longer than what I would prefer. I do understand that sometimes you notice a good looking person but I expect that you just take one glance and then look away, specially if you are with your SO. But instead, I saw him turning his head 3-4 times just to take glances while I was trying wrap up our meal. I felt hurt and disrespected and just let him know the same. He acknowledged that he was actually unconsciously doing it without any thinking that apologized and said that he will take care from that point onwards. Post that, it has decreased, but sometimes I keep seeing him looking around while he's thinking abt something else. I mostly ignore it thinking that maybe he's just unconsciously doing it, but bought it up maybe 1-2 more times something similar happened. 
The worst part of It was, sometimes I don't feel like going out with him to public places because I know there is a high chance of something like that happening again and I hate myself for feeling that way. I am pretty confident about the way I look and I know that people find me attractive. I also know there is always going to be someone more attractive than myself. However I just hate the feeling I get when he looks elsewhere.
2. Another incident - 
One day he mentioned a particular type of footwear and pants that would probably look good on me. He mentioned the same thing again on a later date. This led me to ask him if he's seen this somewhere. He mentioned a female classmate of his used to wear something similar. After some more time, when he bought the same thing up again the third time, that this is a combination that goes well. I know he just might have said it because he might think I will look good in it. However I hate it now. I don't want to wear that exact same thing because I know he saw it on another girl, appreciated it and then mentioned it to me thrice. If I had told him to wear something that I had seen on a guy and was great, not once but thrice.wouldnt it be natural to wonder who this person was that always comes up in conversation? 

Sorry for the long post. Any advice is welcome. I'm not perfect but I know this community has always been supportive to me which is why I turned here for advice. Meanwhile I'm on my second podcast for self acceptance and self love. :) ",TwoXChromosomes
1708949636.0,Will I ever feel normal again after my IUD?,"Sorry if this is long and annoying, I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this and how long this will last? 

I‚Äôm in my early 30‚Äôs, and was trying to ‚Äúget back out there‚Äù in July and decided to explore my birth control options, after talking to my doctor about concerns with my body changing (I‚Äôm now realizing I just am aging and cannot have a 20 year olds body forever) she told me I probably have PCOS and should get a Mirena inserted that day. I complied hoping it would be a catch all for me to lose weight, have less period cramps and issues with my period overall, and obviously not having an unwanted pregnancy. 

I bled for almost an entire month, I felt lethargic and crampy, a lot of foods upset my stomach. I went back for a check up, they said everything looked good besides me having a BV infection for an unknown reason and that I needed to wait 2 more weeks.

The bleeding and pain mostly subsided. But slowly after about a month other issues arose that I‚Äôve never experienced before. I was so sensitive to so many foods, my OCD exploded and was affecting everything, I had severe depression to the point of not leaving my bed and having no urge to chew food in my mouth, I was living off of protein shakes and Ensure, attempted to eat salmon or chicken when I could, calling off of work or showing up just to absolutely lose it cry and leave, my anxiety was uncontrollably high, blurred vision, short black outs, ringing in my ear so loud I couldn‚Äôt hear, acne all over my back/face/neck, and the urge to no longer be alive because this was not worth it. Then my pupils started doing something wild, one would be terrifyingly huge and the other normal, I went to the ER twice for this and they said it was nothing neurological. I saw an ENT for ringing in my ears, they said I had impeccable hearing and felt bad for anyone I lived with, and could not pinpoint why I had tinnitus, they wanted to do an MRI, but I never went back.

By September I got a PCP told them everything while looking absolutely disheveled and unwell, she pushed antidepressants and a therapist on me. I declined on the medication stating I think if I did not have the physical symptoms I was having, the anxiety wouldn‚Äôt be triggered. I asked if the IUD would be causing this, the doctor shrugged and said maybe, but let‚Äôs have a check up in 4 weeks and decide. Blood panel came back with vitamin D deficiency, pre-diabetic/high glucose levels, and high cholesterol if I remember correctly. I was told to workout (as if I could even move) 150 minutes a week, eat more vegetables, and take a vitamin D supplement. I did what I could to control it in a way, I became so fixated on what I could eat mixed with no urge to eat and lost around 28lbs in a month, I remember everyone saying how ‚Äúgood‚Äù I looked, but I felt dead. I was spiraling, I moved back in with my ex because I could no longer take care of myself and was scared (my entire family lives across the country).

One day while at work doing an event I absolutely lost it out of nowhere, in that moment I decided I needed to get it removed. I set up an appointment. The moment she took it out I started crying, she was so confused. I told the doctor that it felt like such a relief. It‚Äôs like when you are flossing and did not know something is between your teeth , but once it‚Äôs removed there‚Äôs a huge relief. It was clear my body did not like it. 

I felt phenomenal the next day, but then my body just..crashed? I was laying in bed convulsing from my anxiety attack, not eating scared to be alone, sleeping all day. I called my mom scared, her nurse friend said it could be a hormonal crash, and my body will take a while to normalize again while it learns to make its own progesterone. Slowly I did start to feel a bit better, I was consistently starting to work again, made plans to move to the mountains in Vail in hopes that the fresh air and closeness of nature would help me, on top of the top tier medical care out here. Thankfully, I have a close childhood friend up here who just wants to see me doing well. 

Fast forward to now, the pupil issue has happened once since removal (in November), but I also was still having debilitating OCD and anxiety at the time. Now I‚Äôm eating whatever I want, have gained about 25 lbs, acne issues have subsided beyond hormonal stuff, I am overall more relaxed and joyful. But, I‚Äôm still having blurred vision issues, I have severe vertigo somedays that makes me feel like I am going to throw up or pass out, uncomfortable tinnitus, and my heart sometimes will just start beating so hard and it will spiral me into an anxiety attack, I feel like I‚Äôm still not as outgoing and fun as I used to be, I don‚Äôt drink I don‚Äôt use caffeine, I try to avoid any triggers. The blood test I received last month said I‚Äôm totally healthy and have none of the issues I had before.

I‚Äôve been off my IUD about 5 months now, will I ever feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again? I want to have kids someday and feeling this way scares me. I am getting an extensive eye exam this month for the pupil issues and blurred vision, my current eye doctor wants to do tests to see if there‚Äôs any indication of a brain tumor. I am seeing a physical therapist for vestibular issues this week in hopes to fix my vertigo/dizziness I get from doing simple tasks. I don‚Äôt love the idea of going on anti anxiety meds, but i don‚Äôt know if this is just my new norm now. 

Has anyone else experienced this? And does it get better? 

TL;DR

Had an IUD inserted, vitamin deficiency, ear ringing, heightened OCD, depression, anxiety, weight loss, acne everywhere, vision issues. It‚Äôs out after 5 months but some issues such as tinnitus, vision issues, and anxiety are lingering. Does it get better?

I have this friend, M19, that I would say is a borderline genius, he speaks french, spanish and english correctly and half-speaks german and japanese; doesn't do drugs, nor alcohol and stopped porn some years ago; plays piano, violin, sings and draws AND its good at sciences, like insanely good at math, computer science and chemistry; and still has time to read books, watch movie and goes to the gym. 

But he genuinely doesn't think those are good things, the other day he confessed to me he does this as a form of escapism because he feels that he is unlovable and that maybe if he does all of this things maybe someone will actually like him. He also told me that his family are the better family he could have ever ask for, as they care about him and ask about his feelings al the time, but he lies and tells everything is fine when its not because he feels desperately lonely. He told me he used to watch porn but not the normal one, but some asmr thing where women say that he is loved and deserves happiness and shit like that and then he told me that the more he watched it the more patethic he felt to the point he didn't have the drive to do it anymore.

He also is good looking except for some acne but he thinks he is below average and started to go to the gym while eating less thinking that he wants to fit in the female gaze and I really don't think its healthy and he knows this too but now he has this weird opinion that women have always being subject to the sexual standards of men and part of feminism is having men subject to the sexual standards of women even if they are unrealistic.

He has a lot of opinions like that which I think they are weird and bad for him but not like problematic in a way? I dont know if I explained myself; like he has the strangest view in abortion ever: He is catholic and thinks abortion is murder but at the same time he agrees that it should be legal until the third month in every case? 

He also used to play online games and watch anime a lot but then suddenly stopped one day, and said that he wasn't a teen anymore and he had to ""get serious"" so he is able to find a job and make lots of money so he can find love. Then he said to me that he didn't think that people who do that are lazy its just that he wants to ""be someone that girls can be comfortable with"". And its weird to me that he has this harmful ideas but only applies them to himself?

I asked him if a girl rejected him or something and he straight up told me that he never approached one with any other intention than friendship but that he was sure he wasn't homosexual and had thought about that before but he just knew he wasn't; neither was he asexual because he feels attracted to woman but he cant find it in himself to go find a girlfriend. 

It turns out this great person hasn't had his first kiss yet! At nineteen years old! And has never tried because he wants to have it with someone he knows loves him for who he is, but at the same time he thinks he just wont ever be loved, and kinda is okay with that?

This man has perfect grades, good body, zero vices, athletic, artistic, smart, is funny, has hobbies, is perfectly capable of seeing woman as persons, but because he doesnt have a car, a house and a job he genuinely thinks he wont be loved, and because the economy is how you know it is, he just like gave up in a way?

At first I thought maybe porn fucked his mind when he was little or the manosphere or something; but my little brother (17m) is practically the same. He went from being the sweetest person in the world to practically a machine? He stopped watching movies, series, playing games to focus on grades in practically a month! And he didn't have bad grades before and my family isn't very worried about our grades or not, and you think this would be a good thing but these are practically fifteen hours session of studying! And is not like he procrastinates or something, I don't even know how he does this! He sits in his room making math exercises all day without music or things and he doesn't tell me things anymore; I have to press him to talk with me. And when I tell yall that he is a machine i mean it! Like he used to complain, and cry, and smile but now absolutely nothing, he just studies and wants a work now.

He told me that he was already 17 and he was 182 cm and probably wasnt going to grow more and he knows he is small down there; (he said that 16 cm was small, and I dont agree but talking to my brother about that felt weird so I let it slide); and he doesnt look like a model so he didnt have too much to offer and instead have to focus on the important things, like being rich. And its not like they were rejected; my brother also told me he approaching girls felt very creepy and would be fine if he was the one being approached, but that if he wasnt then thats because there is something wrong with him.

I asked my dad about this and he said something like they are in a hard moment of their lives and just let them be and that they will come out of it sooner of later. But I don't really think so, they remember of those men that aren't bad persons but for their lifes they are unable to express their feelings.

I have been trying my best to console and help her, but it isn't working at all. Despite blocking him on social meidia platforms, she still texts him after a few days. At this point, her self-respect is draining away. Finally, after talking with her, she accepted that she is not solely the victim and that she should try her best to move on.

I can't meet her often, so I have to console her through text.  
  
The main issue here is that she knows she has no future with him, she knows she needs to move on because he's on her mind constantly, and she knows that her health, sleep, job, and everything else are deteriorating because of this. Despite all this, she keeps saying she can't move on. Recently she said deep down, she still hopes they might get back together if she gives it some time. I've explained countless times that it's not going to happen. Even the guy has said they can't be together.

I work in a male dominated industry (chef) that I've only been in for about 6.5 years. This is my first chef title. The other day I was working with one of my male colleagues and we were talking about pay structure for line cooks and new hires.  I was curious and asked him how much he was making and it was about $5000/year less than me. (I did not share this information with him) He's been in this industry and held this title for the entirety of my carrier. One of the cooks over heard the conversation and mentioned how much one of the other people in my position made, also male, who has been with this company in the position I'm in since the business opened, almost 5 years ago. He literally trained me and works his ass off every day. I make more money than him too, though not as much.

I thought it would be great to be on this side of the glass ceiling, but now I honestly feel kinda bad. Like, the imposter syndrome is real and it's eclipsing all the work I've done to get to this point.

I‚Äôd say I was pretty naive back then (2022) when it came to dating because this guy was clearly only looking for sex. We ended up having a few drinks and he asked to go to my room. Fast forward, he asked if I was ready and immediately started kissing me. He was pretty aggressive in getting things going and I remember thinking to myself ""ugh I really don‚Äôt want to do this"" but unfortunately I went along with it. 

I asked him to wear protection and he seemed upset about my request, he tried to convince me to go raw but I said no multiple times. He pretty much took charge the whole time, threw me around like a rag doll and everything was super rough. I was in extreme pain the whole time, not sure if he thought my noise was moaning but I was definitely grunting in pain. One moment in particular was during missionary, he pinned my arms over my head and was being really rough again - I fought hard to unpin my arms and push his body off of me but he didn‚Äôt get the hint at all. He also removed the condom halfway through, I saw it and could feel the difference but froze and didn‚Äôt say anything..

Anyway, I finally had the courage to ask him to leave because I was ‚Äòtired‚Äô but really I was afraid to say that I was in so much pain. He left and we never spoke again. I was also super embarrassed because I think my roommate might‚Äôve heard all the commotion. Woke up the next morning barely able to walk or sit down. Not sure what to make of that situation - would this be some form of SA? It felt pretty traumatic and made it harder for me to speak about boundaries in future sexual relationships.

thank you guys for the support, advice, resources, and those who are sharing their own experiences/perspectives about similar situations. its kinda (very much) a reality check for me and it‚Äôs one i appreciate so thank you for taking the time to read and respond. i am going to take some time and speak about this with some close friends and get through it. i didn‚Äôt tell anyone i know about the *entire* situation yet. gonna get the fuck out this ü´°.

Edit2/Update : he never told me his age ( I looked him up to find he‚Äôs 24 like a few days after we exchanged numbers) so i asked him today and continued with i am 16. and how it feels inappropriate

he said he‚Äôs turning 21 this year. 
Texted him : he‚Äôs 24, it‚Äôs not ok, and mentally + socially we are in different places in life. 

I looked up his name again on peoplefinders and also found his facebook this time (to make sure i was right) so now i‚Äôm extra 100000% sure i‚Äôm right AND THAT HE IS LYING! WHAT THE FUCK !

Then i blocked and deleted it before i could see anhthing. I‚Äôm very scared of confrontation but it feels like a weight has been lifted off my chest. 

AGAIN, THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS RESPONDED ! Thank you for being apart of this subreddit and providing information + resources. My mother lost 20+ years to my narcissistic father and i feel i lost a lot of my childhood to his abuse that i am getting help for, so.. education is very very important to me.

1708928728.0,I‚Äôm a bit stupid ,"I have been in a relationship for over a year and I never realized how my partner treated me through it all. I never realized their lack of love, respect, etc for me until they did not come see for a whole week despite texting me ransoms I miss you, they would cry saying that I should come see them even though I would work 10 hours for my job and my home being near my workplace. They cried a lot when I would put boundaries, and they will get cold and roll their eyes. I remember one night they stayed over at my home, and they were waiting in bed, while I was running around getting my work things ready as I was on a client site the next day, and they roll their eyes at me and turned their back to me. I tried to snuggle with them, but they did not care. They never have liked facing away from the door when sleeping. Our first big fight was 7 months into our relationship, I felt so insecure about a co worker that my partner use to mention a lot and send funny memes to. She even accompany the co worker to get a tattoo, and she made me wait in the car outside for hours, I was never I invited in. I was worried because the co worker was more fem, and I‚Äôm more of a soft masc, because she would always recommend feminine clothes when shopping. I remember it started with how the coworker would recommend fashion advice that I have recommended before but my partner would always shut me down when I used to mention it. When I told her about it, she said that she just wants to see her coworkers shoes that are the same style. She‚Äôs the type to always lay out what she‚Äôs wearing the day before, the kind of person that never would wear anything that‚Äôs not dressy outside of the home. We were going to boba that was around the corner from where she worked, since I thought it would be good to have a lunch together, and the coworker followed us to the boba behind us. Once we got inside, she moved from my side to be by hers and I asked her why later that day and she said it was because she didn‚Äôt want the wind to hit her. I was hurt even more because she never wanted to lent me a sweater when it was cold, and my car did not have any hot air, so I would be freezing in the morning when I stayed with her. When I would expressed my feelings, she acted like I ruined her day and that I was in the wrong. I felt like my feelings were not valid, and I had to apologize to make her less annoyed. It wasn‚Äôt until that day later on when I exploded, and she tried gaslighting me but that did not work until later, when she saw anger in my eyes, and I was so afraid to hurt her, that I comforted her and I had to stop feeling my feelings. A couple days passed, and it took me a while to heal from it but it hurt so much that I stopped eating. I felt so unloved. A couple days, she mentioned that I never plan anything, but I always am the one making plans , I‚Äôm the one that has always paid (she has only paid like 5 times in our relationship). We had sex a couple days after that fight, I didn‚Äôt want to, I didn‚Äôt feel in the capacity of my mind because I was so hurt, but I didn‚Äôt know I could say no which is stupid to say. I would avoid saying no because I knew she would get annoyed. 
I have back pain and most nights I‚Äôm throwing up and standing in the shower to help with it. One day, I laid down on the bed after throwing up multiple times and spending the whole night in pain, to finally be able to rest and she told me to get up because she needs to be at work. I‚Äôm off but she does not drive. I spent her whole shift in front of her workplace sleeping because I could not rest at night. Another night, when I had back pain, her friends came over, and she volunteered us to go take her home an hour away but it hurts to move. Her roommate volunteered, but my partner said that the roommate has been out all night and that is not safe for her. It hurts that her roommate had more consideration for me than my partner. 
For Christmas, I wrote different love notes on the Christmas tags, and she threw them away. Every love note was dedicated to that specific gift. 


I‚Äôm stupid to let her hurt me, and I‚Äôm stupid for crying over it. I‚Äôm stupid. She was my first relationship, my first everything. I would take care of her, make her soup when she was sick, clean her cats litter box because she didn‚Äôt like doing it, I‚Äôll make her breakfast in the morning, I would read her love poems to sleep, I would buy her flowers, i would remove her makeup, I would get her her favorite coffee, I would do anything for her. 

I talked to her about it, and she said she will change but yesterday it showed me she would not. She mention she might have COVID, and I went to her, and brought medicine and pedalyte, and COVID test while wearing a mask. She tested positive and that day I would rub her back when she was throwing up and I changed her from her outside clothes to her pajamas and stayed with her until she slept and I went home. The day after, I made her soup and dropped it off in front of her door when she was inside. I told her we could talk, and I felt more comfortable if we talked while she was at the front door and I was all the other way in the parking lot. There would barely be cars passing by. She said it was humiliating and that the damage was already done. I would say that we could FaceTime instead if that was better for her mental health. She would say no. She just as always wanted me to bend to her will. I left. 


I‚Äôm stupid for crying over someone but she wasn‚Äôt like that when we first started dating but at a point she changed. I felt trapped. I felt like I would loose hours with her. I lost so much. She wanted my life to revolve around her. I lost all my friends. I feel stupid that I let her. I feel I‚Äôm at fault and I am. 

But a part of me feels like maybe I‚Äôm exaggerating and that what happens wasn‚Äôt a big deal, that the way she treated me wasn‚Äôt a big deal. 

I‚Äôm going to focus on my career and passing my cpa tests.

So I told my mom about this guy that I have been dating. Not so close with my dad so I decided to just tell mom. The guy is a Brahmin and I am a Punjabi (if anyone doesn‚Äôt know there‚Äôs a lot of chaos in India about intercaste marriage) 

So my mom straight up refused for the same. She didn‚Äôt wanna hear a word further when I told her that he was a Brahmin. 

I have been trying to convince her for almost two months now and I don‚Äôt see any ray of hope. Same from the guys side, his parents aren‚Äôt just ready to agree. 

Both of us are madly in love and even the thought of staying apart scared us. But after all this drama going on for about 2-3 months, we have mutually decided to part ways. We are trying to distant ourselves and honestly this is the lowest I have ever been in my life.

That guy was perfect for me. We were perfect for each other and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get the same comfort zone with anyone else. I cry my heart out every night. Everyday feels so monotonous and I just want the day to get over so I can stop thinking and go to sleep. I have not been eating, working or sleeping properly. This has fucked me up so much

1708920912.0,I left my abusive home February 1 -- can I have moral support?,"19f. My mom's abusive. I got into some debt ($2500) because I was off work for two months and have spending problems and my mom found out and was disappointed which is so fair. She said she'll never trust me again and I was like I get it but I'll earn your trust back and she was super dismissive. Then I called my sister to tell her I got into debt as well, to be totally honest and then I started to share something, but realized I couldn't without dropping a huge bomb: my father sexually abused me when we were young. 

My mom knew for a year prior and I asked many times and made sure my sister had the time and energy and nothing going on for the next few days and that she had therapy 2 days later. 

After my mom got mad because my sister said she was furious and my mom went off on me, finally she asked what I told my sister and I said I told her about ---. Then my mom told me how selfish and abusive I am and I don't consider my sister's feelings at all, etc etc. 

I left because I couldn't handle it anymore, telling my sister was the hardest thing I've ever done because all I care about is her feelings. My mom then took away my college fund since wants me to fail (in third year, I'm 19f btw. She's been making comments since I was little about how stupid I am even tho I was 3 grades ahead with 80s-90s). She made it clear I was the pretty, slutty one and my sister was the 'eh looking', smart one. 

I have a place, moved in, got a full time job (I'm a cook/baker) and am working 50 hours a week on top of school + volunteering. Will be making a bunch that I won't need loans and graduate in debt and I'll prove my mom completely wrong (esp since I'm going to get a PhD) 

But now all the pain is coming. I've reached out to my mom, she will <3 messages but that's it and like yeah she's hurt me, I've hurt her, we've all been bitches but I'm tired. And my sister is taking my moms side so my blood family is gone. 

Luckily I have great friends. My one friend and I got a place and my other few are incredible. I only became close with most of them in January, but they all have family trauma and are amazing people and they're my family, they've told me so. They're also all 22-25 so they went through it a while ago and are able to give me other perspectives. 

But I'm devastated. Like I'm also realizing how much my mom has fucked me up, I'm such an insane people pleaser that even now I'm still scared to leave my room and put stuff in the bathroom or living room. I'm working on it, but I was never allowed at home. 

And I just wish my family would apologize. I wish my mom would apologize for 10 things, I have a list on a document if she ever agrees to go to therapy. Cause the difference between her and my sister and myself is that my sister and her think they're amazing people who are so accepting of all, meanwhile I know I can be shit and rude and fuck up, but so can everyone, I'm just trying to be self aware and work on myself to be a better person. 

But it hurts and I guess I just want some support cause I feel bad leaning on my friends so much ",TwoXChromosomes
1708919844.0,Rant on the New Avatar Series ,"This isn‚Äôt a post to debate the animated ATLA series vs Netflix‚Äôs ATLA on who‚Äôs better. This isn‚Äôt even a debate on who should‚Äôve been casted. 

This is a post for me to highlight my concerns and disgust of people nitpicking the cast, especially concerning the female antagonists: Azula, Mai and Ty Lee. Mainly attacking them on only their looks alone. 

It just makes me think that a lot of the fierce backlash is because of the fact the actresses don‚Äôt sexually appeal to them like the cartoons did. I shouldn‚Äôt be this baffled that people are throwing a fit that actresses who are supposed to be playing 14-15 year olds don‚Äôt fit their ideal beauty standards/fantasies, but here we are. 

I‚Äôve always had a problem with those three being sexualized, especially Azula and Ty Lee. If you ever checked out fan art for those two, you‚Äôll be shocked. Considering the fact they are drawing 14 year child soldiers like that. Let‚Äôs be real, all three girls were trained to be living weapons in a war torn world. But people are mad because they‚Äôre not pretty or thin enough to be living weapons. 

On X and Twitter, people are full on fat shaming the three of them or making jokes that live action Azula and Mai might eat Ty Lee. Or the three of them don‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre athletic, despite one of them being a literal gymnast and dancer while the other is a martial artist. 

I checked out the actress who plays Ty Lee on Instagram and she isn‚Äôt fat at all. She‚Äôs not even average weight. She looks like a very happy athletic healthy girl. I also checked out the other two on Instagram as well, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with them at all. 

The actresses who play Azula and Mai are not as fat as people are making them out to be. They‚Äôre average sized women. Also, they‚Äôre off season. It‚Äôs not uncommon for actors and actresses to not look like their iconic selves during off seasons. No doubt they would trim down for their respective characters when the time comes, especially for the upcoming fight scenes in season 2. 

It just seems that Azula isn‚Äôt fulfilling the crazy hot girl dominatrix role, Ty Lee is too modestly dressed and Mai isn‚Äôt a hot goth girl, and that‚Äôs why people are so bent out of shape. They‚Äôre supposed to look youthful because the characters they‚Äôre playing as are literal youths. Like damn, sorry that people don‚Äôt look like two dimensional cartoon girls in real life and actually look the ages of the characters they‚Äôre playing.

From what I learned about the live casting casting for these three girls, a lot of people are outing themselves. ",TwoXChromosomes

The concept of being someone‚Äôs ‚Äúwife‚Äù, possibly taking their last name, having the ring on my finger‚Ä¶ it feels like ownership. On the other hand, I can also see how my commitment issues tie into this and I wonder if I‚Äôm just afraid of divorce? I think it‚Äôs a combination of the two. 

Seeing SO many shitty videos, posts and what not across social media from women saying they‚Äôre stuck or undervalued isn‚Äôt helping either. My parents marriage was terrible before and after they divorced, but my grandparents marriage was absolutely beautiful so I have two polar opposite examples of love to go off of lmao.

That being said, I would LOVE to have a life partner! I just need them to respect my individuality and I want to always know where I end and where they begin.

My family is fairly conservative.

However, I‚Äôm starting to develop my own views more and more and I feel like over the past couple months I have really started to take notice of every little thing men say about women, so casually, but now I can see how it‚Äôs all wrong all of a sudden.

1708916704.0,What to ask a man *Before* having a baby ,"[Reposting this because I felt like too many edits were needed on my original post based on the comments. As a SAHM,  I didn‚Äôt make it inclusive of 2 working parents and didn‚Äôt mean to assume women are automatically the primary caregiver. ]

My main pre-baby question is:

* How will I get free time? * 

A quick scroll of parenting subreddits and you‚Äôll see my point. There‚Äôs so many posts where women don‚Äôt realize until 6 months postpartum that their partner doesn‚Äôt care if they get free time and they have no budget for evening/weekend sitters.

I like this question because it opens a discussion of expectations of daily labor division and how he values parenting. 

Red flags: 
- His main solution is your mom or his mom to chip in. Because he‚Äôs basically saying he never plans to sacrifice his time or money to care for his own child. 
- He is comfortable explaining how babies change your free time, but isn‚Äôt eager to talk about how his hobbies will also need to change.
- He thinks motherhood is rewarding enough that you don‚Äôt need free time and/or it‚Äôs weird you‚Äôre concerned about it.
- He thinks you can get free time by being a SAHM (I‚Äôm a SAHM and this option works for some. But my partner and I know this doesn‚Äôt count as free time)

Obviously, men can hide how they intend to parent. But what are some other parenting discussions that you think can reveal red flags?

Last night a friend and I went out to a local bar near me that happened to be live streaming a Phish concert. Neither of us are Phish phans but we decided stay for a few drinks and frito pie. 

When the livestream started, the bar started selling balloons full of nitrous. Around this same time, my friend and I ordered two margaritas and about halfway through our drink, the bartender took them from us and gave us new ones because, in her words, ‚Äúshe made the drinks wrong.‚Äù When we asked wrong how, she said oh they were just strong. We said we like a strong drink so she gave them back. Everything after this point starts to get blurry.

I‚Äôve had really drunk nights like this before, but this felt different. I also experienced a hangover unlike anything I‚Äôve felt before. I fainted in my kitchen this morning trying to pour water, bruising my leg and chin. I have never fainted before. 

I think our drinks were meant for someone else. I don‚Äôt think we were dosed intentionally, but just because of how the bar was being run this night, it‚Äôs possible a mixup occurred. My friend threw up in the Uber home, but is also blurry after the margarita. 

Now I could just have been super drunk, tested my limits and found them; I just have this nagging feeling that‚Äôs not what this is. Because I wasn‚Äôt attacked or anything like that, I feel safe?

hitched. He seemed pretty different from other men. Pretty thoughtful, remembered Valentine‚Äôs Day and other holidays, helped around the house, supported my career. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. He still does a lot of good things. But he‚Äôs been showing some ugly entitled male behavior.  Like not responding at all if I‚Äôm talking about things I like or about my feelings. Like crickets no response.  And being overwhelming with his loud music, and acting like a know it all so much so that I try not to talk much around him. 

I could live with all of it really. But recently he stopped taking his turn cooking. We both work full time. I kept telling him hey it‚Äôs your turn and honestly it took having a Serious Talk to right things in that area. He still is happy to be passive and let me do all the cooking if I let that happen again which I won‚Äôt. 

The recent thing that happened just bothers me so much. I asked that he acknowledge Valentine‚Äôs Day in some way. He had remembered in previous years and I also made sure he knew I wanted something for v day. Chocolates, flowers. Anything. The day came and.  Nothing. I asked him, and he casually said he forgot. I was sooooooo hurt by this. Spent some nights crying and sleeping on my own. I‚Äôm not over it.  He ran out and got me stuff but really that was too late. 

I‚Äôm just so damned tired of men not doing their share. I‚Äôm disappointed in him for letting his behavior go and seeming like unfortunately too much like a regular, rather thoughtless man.  

I‚Äôm not thinking divorce. Just ranting here. My solution for this situation is to stop trying to do so much for him, and more for me.  I‚Äôm truly mourning what I thought we had and since the V Day let down, I‚Äôve gotten more involved in my church because they make me feel like I truly matter.  I feel unseen and unappreciated and most of all sad

Thanks for listening.   Please do not come at me with Not All Men or you shoulda known better. I‚Äôm kicking myself enough as it is. ",TwoXChromosomes

 I'm feeling a little scared and lost right now and just need advice. I have no one else I can talk to. So I went over to this person's house today that I met online and eventually things got heated and we started making out and stuff. They asked me what I was comfortable with and like, I'm a virgin and wasn't really comfortable going all the way so we just settled with dry humping.
 I left my underwear on and like we did that without them having a condom on but eventually I asked them to put one on because I was scared about pregnancy.  Is there still a chance I could end up pregnant? They also touched me down there after touching themselves, could I end up pregnant that way?

1708909112.0,My partner is emotionally abusive,"This is a very serious post. I have a partner who's much older than me that I met in my early 20s, I'm now 27. He has a terminal illness and I used to feel immense guilt leaving him because he has no family. But I don't feel safe with him anymore. Today during one of his episodes, he pushed me by the chest and threatened to hurt me if I didn't apologize for setting him off. Mind you, he's big and still very strong. He's belittled and insulted me more times than I can count. He blames his illness on me. He takes out his anger from his own unresolved issues on me. I have gone through so much emotional trauma with him that my brain to protect itself doesn't even want to write it, and I'm starting to catch myself having weird mannerisms as a result of it. Needless to say, he's affected me so much that I can't be normal around him because I'm always replaying the things he's done and said to me. Today he wanted me to be loving towards him after he pushed me, but he had already mentally drained me of any love energy he expected from me so I become very brash which only makes it worse. I work hard to rebuild my self-esteem each time he demolishes it. I am fed up and I hate him, but I feel stuck and lost.

Edit: I am planning something so I can leave without him knowing. Once I leave, I know he's not going to make it. He's only survived with his illness this long because of me. I've helped him with a place to stay, food, everything. I don't know how I am going to cope knowing his life will be over after I leave.",TwoXChromosomes
1708908746.0,"Is life as a single, adult, woman just about being completely alone?","The past few months have been a but of a wild ride of shitty things. (Family in a country at war, I lost my job and was unemployed for 3 months (which I know is nothing and am very grateful to have gotten back to work so quickly.)) To cap off the year from hell one my best friends Adam (32M), who I've known for like 8 years, let me know that his girlfriend wasn't comfortable with us being friends, didn't trust that we weren't more than friends, and that our friendship was straining his relationship. We had a short, non-romantic, physical history, so while there was nothing going on between us and we've never seen each other romantically, I could still understand her fears. He made the call and wanted to give his relationship a fair chance and told me that we couldn't be friends anymore. We were both devastating having this conversation. He didn't 100% want to do it, but didn't know what else to do.

To say this was heartbreaking and devastating is an understatement. I have this long-standing irrational fear that all my friends will leave me, are just waiting for the opportunity to drop me, and that I will be completely alone forever. (I'm in therapy and all that, but just to emphasis the sort of internal impact this conversation had on me) It basically validated all my fears and kind of undid years of therapy. I don't have many friends. Actually, I don't have any really. There's Adam, and one other person, who I both consider my best friends, and then no one else. Not in a exaggerating way. I don't have anyone else outside of them two. Still, I had to respect that decision and now I can't talk to him at all anymore. 

And then there the other friend, Amanda. I've known Amanda for over 10 years. We met freshman semester of college and have been best friends for basically that entire time. We were very much so the 'text everyday' and meet up at least once a week type of friends. But she hasn't really been responsive to me much the past few months. I've tried to reach out to talk and sometimes have just gotten a lot of non-answers. While I was unemployed she went a full month and a half without answering my texts, which at one point dissolved into me straight up saying ""Can you at least let me know you're physically okay?""

I don't expect people to text me back right away, but if you're someone that I used to talk to on a daily basis, someone who promises me that we'll hang out more and be around for me while I'm unemployed, and then completely ghost me for 6 weeks, it's hard to not start worrying. 

I ended up seeing her later that day after my conversation with Adam, because we were already supposed to go to a concert. It was the first time I had actually seen her in 2 months. I didn't tell her anything then, we literally was just at the concert and that's it and it's kind of hard to have that kind of conversation in between acts. 

When I dropped her off at home, she was just like ""bye!"" and went inside, where historically we probably would have hung out and ordered food in. I internally made the assumption that we would hang out after, so when she just said bye, I didn't really say anything.  

I reached out to her the next day, to talk through the whole goodbye conversation with Adam and eventually was able to agree upon a time for me to come over to talk. During this talk she basically sat back and told me that she's been wanting to talk to me about something too. It came up after I mentioned how not okay I've been with us not really talking recently. 

Her boyfriend, apparently, thinks I don't like him, isn't comfortable around me, and doesn't want to be around me, and also didn't trust we were only just friends. We're both Bi but very much so Platonic and nothing has ever happened between us. Not even a conversation about something happening has happened. She was very ""it is what it is"" about it, but said that she didn't want to invalidate his feelings, if that's how he felt. 

I don't fully understand why still and honestly, I can't understand how she didn't defend me. 

We didn't really ""end"" that conversation. It was basically around the time he would be getting home for work, and Amanda said that I should probably head out before he got home. Which, I don't think she's ever asked me to leave her house. But there was no ""we can't be friends anymore"" line drawn, it was more a ""it'll be hard to hang out"" line.

Honestly, that conversation completely broke me. I came to her expecting support for basically all of my worst fears come to life, and they were basically doubled up and re-validated. I've felt lost, heartbroken, betrayed, abandoned. Come up with an adjective, it'll probably work. Being unemployed can already feel like such an isolating and abandoning experience, and this just all added so much onto that. 

Over the past two months, I've tried to start conversations, but they really haven't gone anywhere. Either I get literally no response, or the response is such a non-reply. Nothing that opens engagement or conversation. I stopped texting to try and get my head straight, and honestly, I just thought she would reach out, just this once. I'm always the one to reach out first, to check in, to make plans, and I thought that just this once, she would reach out to me. She would check in on me, make sure I'm okay, and she just hasn't. I told her I got a job offer and it just a ""congrats!"" and nothing else. She hasn't asked me about my job, I'm well, anything. 

And now I'm just spiraling. I'm single, and I've always been single. I've never been in a relationship, hell I've never been on a date, and at this point I'm not really holding my breath for something to happen. Probably because of this, I hold a lot of value in my friendships, and they are deeply meaningful to me.

But, am I just destined to always be alone? Am I just stuck in the loop of friends choosing their partners over me, but never having anyone actually choosing me? I hate the idea that the only way for me to have a meaningful relationship is for it to be romantic, when I truly believe that friendships can be as meaningful, and as profound as romantic relationships. But its starting to really feel like if no one will ever love me in that way, no one will ever love me. Is this just.... it?",TwoXChromosomes
1708903710.0,Trying to deal with men,"Hi, I‚Äôm a lurker and I don‚Äôt normally post on here but I really just need to vent. For a bit of context, I‚Äôm in my early 20‚Äôs and I‚Äôve been in the military for almost 3 years now. Before I joined, and I was still living at home, I‚Äôd always read about women‚Äôs experiences in male-dominated workforces and how hard it is. Just reading about it is one thing, but experiencing it firsthand is something I could never even imagine. I feel constantly defeated and depressed daily working and interacting with men. 

I‚Äôve always had pretty low self esteem and confidence issues, but they have never felt as bad as these past few months. In my division, there are 3 women including myself. They are very kind, beautiful women who seem capable and are people that are easily admired. Objectively, I‚Äôm not very attractive. I could stand to lose weight and I‚Äôm very bad with people. I‚Äôve gotten better at talking to people since enlisting, but overall, I‚Äôm pathetic at making friends. A few weeks ago, one of the guys in my division admits to me that him and the other guys ranked the 3 of us and they were having a ‚Äúfriendly debate‚Äù about looks, personality, body, etc.,. Overall, they concluded that one specific girl was the most attractive in all aspects but the other ‚Äúhad a wagon on her.‚Äù And, predictably, it was agreed that I was not very interesting. When comparing myself to other girls in the past, I was always able to eventually center myself by reminding myself that all of my thoughts were just that - thoughts. I was being irrational and I was thinking the worst of things. But to have other people confirm my worst insecurities‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt know what to think. 

All these men talk about it the way women look. My only strength is that I‚Äôm good at taking tests and remembering things. It‚Äôs the only thing I can ever fall back on. In my branch of service, promoting to the next rank can be based off of this. I recently promoted to the next rank because I was able to score well enough, despite it being my first time. Typically, for people with my job, it takes 2-4+ years to make it where I‚Äôm at and I did it in less than one. My new rank has put me in charge of most of these men in my division. I don‚Äôt have any authority over these people at all. They don‚Äôt respect me in the slightest. They have voiced that I just ‚Äúgot lucky‚Äù and they really just see me as just their peer. I spent over 7 months studying almost daily for this exam. I earned it - I know that much. But they don‚Äôt listen to me. They scoff when I tell them to do something - even if I ask nicely. They give attitude when I push back. No man in my position get treated this way. The men at the same rank do not get treated this way. 

What do I have to do to earn respect and be treated as a human? Why do men deserve respect immediately, but women have to earn it over and over and over again? My mom works in a male-dominated technical industry and she says it‚Äôs always been like this. Men always talk over you, demean you, objectify you‚Ä¶ this is nothing new. 

I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I have nothing to look forward to. I can‚Äôt look in the mirror without being reminded about the way I look. I can‚Äôt look at my subordinates without being reminded how they see me. I can‚Äôt focus on my work because I am never taken seriously. Nothing I do matters. I am genuinely at my wit‚Äôs end. I‚Äôve tried talking to my boss, but he really did not seem to care. I didn‚Äôt tell him about the first scenario, and he just said to ignore them. How can I ignore any of this? My life revolves around my job. For half the year, I see these people 12+ hours a day. For the other half, I only get weekends off.

My thoughts feel consumed by how I will never be enough. Everything feels pointless. Nothing I do will ever matter. Does this feeling ever go away? Am I doing something wrong? There has to be more to life than this. 

I know that other women experience this. How are they able to cope? What am I missing? How do I build self-confidence, love, and find value within myself despite everything around me telling me the opposite? 

I apologize in advance if all of this feels very trivial. I know there are more important things in this world to be focused on. I am trying. I just‚Ä¶ Everything feels so distracting. All of the ways I am disgusting loom over me daily and impact me more than is bearable.  ",TwoXChromosomes
1708907828.0,The way we dress,"After commenting in a thread about women‚Äôs outfits for the gym it got me thinking about how bothered a lot of people (men and women too) are over women‚Äôs outfits in general.. 

One comment basically claimed that wearing tight clothes(in this case gym clothes) is just for fashion and is NOT comfortable and that we should ‚Äújust admit it‚Äù. Like we‚Äôre just a bunch of lying hoes. üòÇ This was of course, a man deciding on behalf of ALL women..üôÑ 

Meanwhile a lot of us here were just discussing for the 10000th time about whether or not thongs are comfortable.. Some say yes and some say no.. Its truly a matter of personal preference. 

But it got me thinking about my own fashion choices throughout the years. Oddly enough when I was younger, less confident in myself and caring more about everyone‚Äôs view of me, especially the male gaze, I dressed far more modest I suppose.. Baggier clothes, RARELY wore dresses or skirts or even shorts. I get now that I avoided a lot of my inner femininity thinking I‚Äôm protecting myself after watching the world blame women for getting attacked or treated bad for how they dressed, how they ‚Äúask for it‚Äù. This was the unfortunate outlook by many comments in that thread. Spending time in places where you DO have to cover up as a woman will show you how the clothes truly aren‚Äôt the issue‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

He remarried after my mom died to someone who is now disabled, and I know that they have been suffering financially because my dad is taking care of her and can‚Äôt work(he finally retired about three years ago). I found out that he had taken out an equity loan to help pay for expenses, using his house as leverage(basically a second mortgage on a house that got paid off years ago when my mom passed away with her insurance).

1708899005.0,Copper to Mirena IUD experience,"Sharing my experience for anyone else finding themselves in a similar situation. I got a copper IUD in August 2022 as an emergency contraceptive. Condom failed on day 14 of cycle, so not ideal time for plan B. Was not pregnant. I intended to keep the copper IUD until my partners vasectomy was completed and tested. 

The copper IUD was fine at first, but at some point I found my periods becoming longer and longer, to the point I was regularly bleeding around 2 weeks out of the month. It was taking a toll on my comfort so decided to try to switch to a Mirena as an extra back up to my partners vasectomy (we already have 3 kids and he has a family history of vasectomies failing) and to eliminate periods altogether.

Getting an appointment took longer than I‚Äôd hoped, and I had two important trips coming up that would both fall during my 2 week long period. I asked my Dr for a prescription for Norethindrone 5 mg 3 times daily for two weeks to delay my period and that worked well.

When I got the Mirena, removal of the copper and insertion was not very painful for me, thankfully. What I wasn‚Äôt prepared for was the constant bleeding for about 9 weeks. It was MORE than the spotting we are told to expect, but not exactly a period. Not enough to justify tampons for example but still ruining underwear. This took a toll on my sex life.  I decided to try a menstrual disc since it can be used during sex. This worked perfectly for containing my bleeding and my partner didn‚Äôt feel it during sex/no leaks. I would highly recommend this for anyone in a similar situation.

When this bleeding stopped I had one period that was literally one spot of blood. The next was spotting or a light period on and off for around 10 days which I didn‚Äôt enjoy. This month was one day of spotting, then nothing for a week and one day of a light period. I‚Äôm hoping this becomes a bit more predictable but it‚Äôs certainly an improvement.

They have made life more ‚Äútolerable.‚Äù My daytime gummies have an effect similar to Ativan but without the sedating effects. The stronger ones which I take at bedtime, help me fall asleep and sleep through the night. I honestly don‚Äôt know what I would do without edibles right now. I‚Äôm so happy I mustered up the courage to try them. I thought people were just exaggerating the effects & benefits, as I‚Äôve smoked/vaped pot before and it‚Äôs never done much for me, but man was I wrong. 

I hope to be back this spring with some good news about my loved one. I hope we get to hear the words, ‚Äúcancer free‚Äù in the coming months. For anyone else out there who‚Äôs going through a hard time, low dose cannabis edibles may be worth a shot. Sending love and light ‚ú®

1708891060.0,I am never dating again ,"I tried dating for the first time in years, and this was my first time using a dating app (Bumble). I created an account this morning and got over a hundred likes, but I seemed to click with one guy. He was one of the first ones I messaged and lived in the same area as me. He was also physically quite attractive, in good shape and almost 193 cm, so we decided to have coffee together. He was enjoyable at first, a good conversationalist, and then he asked me for my Snapchat. I gave him mine and he added me. When I added him back, I was curious to see his story and it was a video of him *vaping* all over his cat, *a baby kitten*, repeatedly. He was holding the kitten in one hand and the vape in the other and the kitten clearly wanted to get away but he was doing it anyway. I was about to yell at him in rage, but ended up just leaving. I blocked him everywhere and reported his story. I also deleted my Bumble account. I still feel awful about that cat and I wish I could do more for her.

Dating is horrible and I am not doing it again. I never wanted to do it anyway. It was a friend who suggested me to give dating apps a try since I have not dated for years. Nobody on these apps is my type intellectually and I don't want to settle for less. Maybe they're good for hookups, but they'll never stimulate me intellectually and I have no desire for a boring hookup. I am content watching my favourite TV series and movies at home with my cat and reading my favourite books. I have my mum and my sisters to hang out with when I am bored. I have my friends to talk to. The one good thing about this experience was that it made me realise dating is not for me.

1708887012.0,Oncoming UTI?,"I (20F) have had UTIs in the past, probably 3 or 4 - with my most recent one being in late October. Last night, my friends and I went bar hopping. Around 3:30 am, we stopped at a gas station to use the restroom and I peed. It didn't burn when I peed, but it burned slightly after - immediately when the pee stopped. The pain was very short and nothing drawn out. We arrived home around 4-4:15, and I immediately took the AZO UTI relief pills, drank some water, and used the bathroom about 10 minutes later.

When I used the bathroom, the pee was very bright orange (typical while taking any pills for UTI), and the same burning sensation right after I peed happened. I stayed on the toilet for a long while, because I kept feeling like I had to pee, but only dribbles were coming out. When I finished and stood up, I felt the sensation of needing to pee again, but nothing near how bad it's been with my previous UTIs.

I recently woke up and used the bathroom again about 20 minutes ago, pee still orange and much less burning immediately when I finished peeing (the burning sensation wasn't even that bad to begin with, thank God). But just now, while I was peeing, I felt a slight pain/huge itch in my vagina while I was peeing??? It only lasted for a few seconds then went away. I'm sitting down now, and the sensation to pee is nowhere near as bad as it's been in the past with my other UTI's, so I'm not complaining.

I know you're probably thinking ""This is obviously a UTI"" but again, this seems very different from any other UTI I've had in the past. I'm drinking tons of water, and I'm gonna get cranberry juice in a little bit. I just wanna know if it's common for UTI's to be different, or if they're almost always the exact same. If this is a UTI, it's nowhere near as painful as the other one's I've had. I'm not sure if this is the full extent of discomfort I'll be feeling, or if this is just the onset of more to come. Right now, I feel perfectly fine and don't really feel like I have to pee, but I'm hoping that doesn't change when I pee next. I also haven't engaged in anything that would really cause a UTI (to my knowledge). I pee immediately after having sex, I stay very hydrated, and I don't wear pants or underwear that's too tight. Regardless, I'm not sure whether or not I should even be taking the AZO UTI pills, or what's really going on.",TwoXChromosomes

1708883713.0,I met a deplorable human being and I can't stop thinking about it,"I went to a concert last night. I went with my neighbors and my neighbor's adult daughter. Upon arrival, we went to have dinner at the connecting restaurant before the show. Daughter's coworker, deplorable dude (dd) also joins us. He's nice, we all chit chat over dinner and drinks. Daughter is getting very drunk, and by the time the show starts she's black out shitfaced. Now, i only saw her drink maybe 4 small glasses of wine, I was confused by her behavior and wondered if there was something else going on. 

Long story short, neighbor leaves with his daughter to the car. Tells me to stay and enjoy the show for awhile while he takes care of her.

I'm there with dd. The first red flag was when he pointed his brother out to me in the crowd. He said, that's my brother and that's his linebacker girlfriend. He was referring to an average sized tall girl standing next to him. First red flag. A few songs into the show he points out the female performer. The wife of the front man. He says you'd think a front man of a famous band would have a better looking wife. Second red flag. Then he goes to the bar and buys us beers. He hands me mine and chugs his pretty quickly. He then grabs me by the wrist and tilts my beer into his mouth and takes a big gulp. I was like WTF and I just gave the rest of the beer to him. As if things couldn't get any stranger, he then leans in to say something to me and completely cups my ass cheek with one hand. He does this more than once. Up to this point I have been openly talking about myself, my husband and our three kids. He knows I was married and I'm wearing a wedding ring. At this point I was over it so I went to the bathroom and then just ditched him after that.

In retrospect I wish I had done more to snap at him when that happened. I was just so surprised and Confused. It also got me thinking about my neighbor's daughter and how she seemed to be very intoxicated despite only drinking some wine. And she was alone with him at some point.

The whole thing is just rubbing me the wrong way and I have been talking to my neighbors about the whole situation. They said they will speak to her and see what she recalls. Long story short it was probably the most disgusting person I've ever met in my life.

1708874792.0,What counts as abuse?,"I hope this is allowed, I'm really hoping to find some advice and hear from other women who have been through similar things.


I've been reading ""Why does he do that?"" and it's making me question if my partner (25M) is abusive. 

He slams doors during our arguments when he gets really frustrated. He always sighs and shakes his head while sitting in silence and it's only recently that he's stopped scrolling on his phone when we're having arguments. I had to ask for him to stop going on his phone, he didn't do it of his own accord.

If we're sleeping in different rooms, he slams the door to whatever room he's in. He slammed a door yesterday and locked it, then later claimed he didn't slam it when I brought it up. 

He'll wash dishes really angrily - banging things around and slamming cutlery down. Then he gets mad at me when I'm shaking and physically moving over on the couch to be further away from him. 

He will yell during arguments and start swearing. I'm the only one who has ever apologized for swearing during a fight (I rarely ever swear so I feel bad when my emotions get the better of me). He's called me stupid, said I'm a dick and an asshole. He only apologized for calling me stupid when I brought it up and said he's just being mean and what purpose does it serve to call me dumb, how does it help anything? That's one of his favorite things to ask me if I start getting emotional and try to bring up things he's done wrong. He says I'm trying to start new fights and how does it solve anything.

I've had to barricade a door before because I was so scared of him. And then he never apologized for that and for scaring me to that point. I was the one who ended up apologizing during that argument.

However, when our relationship is good, it's amazing. I'm the one doing things that lead to him being angry. I've been on the pill (so he doesn't have to wear condoms) and it's turned me into a different person. Something I'm not comfortable with is that he's said he's happy to use only condoms, and I've said I'm not. He's been saying it's a strange opinion and he doesn't get it, but ""he respects it"". I feel like he doesn't actually respect me with that - he said he's never met anyone else with that opinion. It feels like he's saying that I'm in the wrong and that I should change my mind because his opinion is for my own good (could stop taking the pill). 

He keeps saying he wants me to find myself again (I want to as well), but then he has these outbursts and never apologizes for them. I feel so bad, I'm driving him to become this person. I feel like I've been an awful partner and it's not fair for me to call him abusive when I've become a different person and keep messing things up.

So far this guy has been great. He‚Äôs very polite, opens doors for me, has been giving me compliments a lot, has brought me sweet treats from the restaurant where he works unprompted, and even asked before holding my hand and kissing me on our last date.

Has anyone had trouble starting with someone new after leaving someone with anger issues?

My (34f) mom (61f) went in for a hysterectomy on Wednesday. During so, the surgeon somehow managed to damage both of her ureters. Aka the tubes that carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder. They called in another surgeon to fix this. In total she was under anesthesia for 12 hours. 

Ever since, she has moments where she‚Äôs very confused. She mistook me for her nurse multiple times. She thought animals were in the room and wanted to pet them. She would start talking while sleeping and wake herself up. I told nurses about this and they say it‚Äôs fine because she knows who she is and when her birthday is etc. I felt like maybe she was getting better until on the way home, we stopped at the pharmacy drive thru to get her meds and she asked for a small fry and a coke, then thought I was hoarding all the fries when she didn‚Äôt get any. 

I know she‚Äôs still recovering, and physically-wise she‚Äôs coming along great, but I‚Äôm just really worried about her and was just curious I guess if anyone else went through this. Kind of went down a rabbit hole and now scared the long exposure to anesthesia could have done lasting damages. Idk I just want to do whatever I can for her.

Got home and it was better but I still felt off and painful so I went to the ER. CT showed some fluid and blood in the pelvis so they are thinking that a cyst ruptured.

Sent me home with pain meds and to follow up with ob/gyn. Pain was pretty much all gone by the time I left the hospital, just some soreness. 

Anyone else deal with this? I've been feeling pretty ok. Just some back pain and what feels like soreness in pelvis occasionally, but my anxiety is revving up and I keep thinking what if they missed a torsion or something?

1708829702.0,Why Does He Do That? continues to open my eyes everyday ,"I read this book a couple of years ago when i had just broken up with someone after going out with him for 8 months. 

The first time he lost his temper, he punched furniture and yelled. I walked out of the house because I grew up in a family where violence was normal and I told him that it was unacceptable for me. The next day he said he didn't remember getting angry but if he did, it was definitely my fault because he's not that kind of person anymore. Thank the gods for everything I read on this community. It was enough of a red flag for me to break it off.

Since reading the book I have less friends but much much better people around me.

'A friend' started screaming at the only woman on the opposite team that he was playing against cos he lost. Insisted that it was not his fault he 'got upset'. He was hurt that no one (the only woman) praised him for doing well. On the losing team. In a team v team game. He's never responsible for his anger right?

'A friend' who found out I was single asked me to dinner to catch up on work but showed up with flowers, in a suit and with a present of jewellery. He was upset when I pointed out that I felt blindsided. Told our mutual friend group that I'm damaged so no wonder I'm too sensitive to be exposed to violence by my ex. They should be careful around someone like me who might cry wolf and get innocent guys in trouble. Because violence is normal, trying to fuck someone from work a week after their breakup is fine and I'm the problem right?

'A friend' who thought it was funny to test things out as a critical thinker. Like when her boyfriend bought a new phone case, she threw his phone into the road to check that the case was protective. She insists she was helping him. But she wouldn't ever throw her own phone right?

'A friend' insists that the reason his wife has a personal protection order against him is because they have past karma to clear. So he called the police when she pushed past him. when he got angry and he kept her up all night interrogating her, ranting at her and refusing to let her leave until he said what he needed to say. It's her karma right?

I can't overstate how this book made me look at not just potential partners but behaviour. How people do hurtful, nasty things without taking responsibility for it. Or taking the tiniest amount of responsibility but insisting the other person asked for it. It doesn't have to be overt violence. Spreading rumours, twisting the truth to make themselves the victim when they were clearly the aggressor, passive aggressive behaviour. Let's be clear that it's not necessarily abuse. But it does tell you alot about the person. 

Even if you are not in an abusive relationship, this book may help you determine what behaviours are acceptable or unacceptable for you. Please. Read it if you have yet to. Replace ""he"" with they.

1708828116.0,People who cheated: why did you do it?,"I just found out my brother's wife has been cheating on him for months and nobody suspected anything. Not her friends, family, my brother, nobody. When I saw them for Christmas they seemed as loving as they had been during their entire 10 year relationship. 

My brother didn't expect anything and is devastated. She told him she felt like they had been drifting apart for the last 2 years and he lost her on his journey. Then she started catching feelings for her dance partner, they got closer, met up in person, and eventually started sleeping with each other. 

And nobody understands why. Why couldn't she talk to my brother when she started they were drifting apart? Or when she started catching feelings for someone else? There were so many points where she could've said something or tried talking to him, or she could have just left him without sleeping with someone else and cheating on him. 

They built a house together. They had their future planned out. They were talking about kids. All while she was sleeping with someone else behind my brother's back and fooling everyone. Her parents are devastated and her sister hates her right now because they all loved my brother. 

The guy she cheated with apparently also has a wife and told her, but I'm not sure how true this is. And now my brother's wife doesn't talk to anyone and all she has said is that she made a huge mistake. But how could it get this far? There were so many opportunities between drifting apart and sleeping with someone where she could've talked to my brother about it. She is the last person anyone would have expected to do something like this.

He actually had to come help tow my car out right before dinner because I was stuck in the snow in my driveway lol. First date I (F30) really enjoyed in a long time, I was giddy and excited to see him (M28) again. He was sweet, and easy to talk to. 

He drove me home and we kissed in his truck. It was all great until he gripped his left hand around my neck and gently but firmly squeezed. It wasn't a sensual, caressing touch, like along the back of the neck, and it did make me nervous. My airway wasn't cut off, and I didn't say or do anything in the moment, I suppose just out of shock. 

I really enjoyed the night overall but the more I think of it today, the last part really threw me off. Should I give him a second date and just state my displeasure with what happened or is this the type of man to just stay away from? 


Edit: Thanks ladies, you're right. I'm currently in therapy trying to learn to set boundaries and stand up for myself. I appreciate the reminder from you all that this is completely unacceptable behaviour. 

Edit 2: I'm embarrassed to admit that this isn't the first man to do this to me, I was just shocked he did it on the first date.  I had normalized this behaviour from men, but I'm understanding now how reckless and dangerous it is. I feel silly for having asked but really appreciate everyone knocking some sense into me.  

Edit 3: I decided my health and safety is not worth risking the potential that he's a good person, especially after just one date. I texted him last night that what happened made me uncomfortable and that I will not be pursuing things further. I'm sure he's surprised as earlier I'd been eager to see him again. I blocked him immediately after. In the past I've struggled immensely with setting boundaries or speaking up, so thanks to everyone for reminding me to put myself first. ",TwoXChromosomes

Prior to this I lived with my mom and had two other boyfriends throughout those years I was sexually active with them and never experienced this. In fact, I never even had a uti, yeast infection, or bv with them which lets me know something is up with my current partner. 


I‚Äôve been tested for full panel std multiple times- I‚Äôve been negative each time, diabetes/A1C is in normal range, and UTI culture came back negative. My urine culture did recently come back as ‚Äúpositive for nitrites with increased white blood cells‚Äù. But doc said lab results don‚Äôt show for UTI. For the twentieth time doc told me I probably have bacterial vaginosis or yeast infection because of the lab results. I‚Äôm not buying it. Each time I take antibiotics I feel relief, then have sex with boyfriend and the issue comes right back. I do pee after sex.


 I can‚Äôt live like this any longer. I‚Äôve also been told it‚Äôs interstitial cystitis, again I‚Äôm not buying it. It‚Äôs too much of a coincidence that I start getting these weird symptoms after becoming sexually active with current boyfriend. 


I need to get tested for ureaplasma/ mycoplasma because everything I‚Äôve read leads to this. I need to get to the root of this. I didn‚Äôt even know what this was until last month and I‚Äôm a whole nurse- no one talks about this??


My issue is that I don‚Äôt have health insurance. My mom lost her job and I was on her healthcare plan. I‚Äôm unable to enroll at my job at this time.

Out with my family around 10ish in the night, me and my sister stood back to take some pictures. We were in the city centre, so it was pretty crowded. A lot going on. 

This guy makes eye contact with me, he looked very young, was maybe 23-27. He was behind me and my sister. But kept stopping everytime we stopped, and carried on walking when we were.

And then my sister ran up to my dad, mum, brother and was panicking saying this guy is following us. He stopped and moved to the side and watched us the whole time, making eye contact with me specifically. He then started texting. Then my dad made eye contact with him, stared him down and he stopped following us. I assume he thought me and my sister were alone because we were far behind from my family.

Why tf do men do this? Was he trying to rape us, rob us? What has your experience been? 

I'm still pretty spooked out. Just from the possibilities of what could have happened if we were genuinely alone. Stabbed, robbed, raped, trafficked, I don't know what his intentions were. I could have had my life change drastically based on circumstance.

We were on the way to the car park. If we were alone, he could of just knocked both of us the fuck out and then could have killed us or something. 

Wonder how they pick their victims. Me and my sister are both petite. Maybe we don't look physically intimidating due to this? He was kind of small himself. Maybe like 5'7? And we're a lot smaller than that. What can I do about that?

After being in a relationship for 3 years with a 24m, I (21f) have little to no libido. My partner is fairly sexual, sometimes really sexual, all depending on where he is with his p\*rn addiction. When he is not actively addicted, he is less sexual but depends on me to relieve his desires (and says we need to have sex regularly or he will have to keep watching it). We see each other maybe twice-three times a week and sex is usually initiated but I have no desire and it feels like a chore (i still usually do it). The first year or two we started dating we had sex all the time and I wanted to, even sometimes masturbating...and I was on an anti-depressant AND birth control then (I finally got off both a year ago!). To be frank (and a little tmi), the sex is never impromptu (kinda impossible when living in parents houses) and he has a fetish for a certain type of clothes and he makes me wear it pretty much every time we have sex. The clothes are not really a turn off, I can even find them sexy sometimes, but I quickly have grown to hate it. I hate that I feel like I have to be and look like a sex doll everytime and it feels like what you see in p\*rn. I feel degraded and stupid (and not in a good way haha). I outwardly express my dislike for having to ""dress up"" everytime but he honestly won't get turned on if I don't most of the time. Lately as well, I just don't want to do it at all. I want loving, intimate sex. Instead I feel like I'm laying there just waiting till he is done so I can say I did my ""girlfriend duty"" and he won't have to watch p\*rn. I also have no desire to masturbate, I can never find myself hot or sexy as I did two/three years ago, and I would be okay having sex once every two months. I honestly feel icky thinking about sex with him as of this past month or so...I feel very guilty.

I got so much affirmation and positive responses‚Äîthank you all so much. I deleted the post because it was getting popular, and I was scared of him seeing it. I'll put the original story down below.

**UPDATE:** I brought the topic up to my boyfriend again the other night, and he said:
- I was only thinking about myself
- I was crying throughout the convo, and he told me to calm down
- I'm not thinking my decision through
- I wasn't thinking about the health of my car for a LDR
- When I say his words hurt me, he says I should've brought this up earlier, and my inability to communicate about things hurts HIM. I don't like bringing things up for this very reason: his defensiveness and gaslighting. No ""I'm sorry I hurt you,"" just deflecting blame onto me and changing the subject.
- In the middle of when I was talking, he calculated how much my rent would be and said it was unreasonable for me to not be able to afford it. 

We both went to sleep, and the next morning he didn't go to work. He came into the living room and said ""We NEED to talk about last night."" I said ""I really don't feel like it at the moment, I need some time to process everything that was said."" To which he says, ""Having conversations late at night just isn't good. I got NO sleep last night."" I went to the bathroom. He followed me, and said, ""Listen, I know you don't want to talk about our argument, but we need to. We need to be ADULTS about this situation. This isn't okay."" 

The patronizing tone bothers me so much. It's so common with him. I feel like he views me as ""less,"" and my needs aren't as important. At the same time, his guilt tripping is working. I feel like a horrible girlfriend who doesn't value her relationship, for wanting to live with my mom during clinicals in graduate school to save money on rent. I feel awful, and guilty for wanting to do a LDR, even though I know his responses aren't healthy.

I'm visiting my mom for a little while. He texted me apologizing for trying to talk when I didn't want to. I appreciate this, but I know it'll happen again. I'm thinking about the good times we've had together and our jokes, the comfort of a long term relationship & the fear of never meeting someone else, and I feel horrible. This is my first relationship. I really need some support for my choices, and advice moving forward. I'm nervous to go back home to him. He's going to be super nice to me, and it'll be so hard to pack up and move.



**ORIGINAL STORY:**
How should I tell my boyfriend I need to move out and start a LDR because of my clinicals? Should I move out?

My boyfriend (29M) and I (24F) have been together for 4 years. One year ago, he recieved a job opportunity from a family member, so he moved back to his hometown, and I moved in with him. My only family and friends are roughly 2 hours away. 

I'm currently in an online graduate program, and in-person clinicals will start soon. They'll go for 2 years, 3-5 days a week, along with me taking 3 online classes every semester. 

I'm really struggling to decide where I want to do clinicals. I have the option of doing them where my mom lives, where I could live with her for free, which would relieve a lot of stress for me & provide stability. I could also do clinicals where me and my boyfriend live, however, I'd have to work every weekend + some weeknights just to make rent.

I brought it up to him, and my boyfriend expressed strong feelings against me moving in with my mom. He said he'd really like me to stay, and that ""the easiest option isn't always the best."" I expressed that if we lived together, every weekend and half of the weeknights would be spent apart, with me working to make rent. But if I live with my mom, I could drive to see him every weekend and we could actually spend time together.

He said if I leave, he'd have to move back in with his parents which would be bad for his mental health. I asked him how that was possible, with a one bedroom rent here averaging $1,200, and he makes $65k a year. He got upset and I apologized. I ended up agreeing in the moment to try to do clinicals here, because I felt pressured to. 

What is the smartest decision here? I really wish he was more open to a LDR, but I respect his opinions. I know I would miss him every day, but I can't imagine choosing a ""harder"" path and not even getting time with him, growing resentful of what all I've sacrificed and compromised.

I'm also feeling very guilty about his reasoning‚ÄìI feel like I CAN'T move in with my mom. Feeling very sad and confused, when I just want to be happy and actually look forward to my clinicals and education! How/when should I tell him I'm moving in with my mom? Our lease ends in May. I have no idea how he will react. Is this even what I should do? ",TwoXChromosomes
1708804026.0,Think I had a ruptured ovarian cyst yesterday,"I came on my period a couple of days ago as expected, however when I woke yesterday morning, I was in the most pain I‚Äôve ever been in. My periods are usually pretty pain free, the odd cramp, so immediately I knew this wasn‚Äôt just period pain. 

I was getting waves of pain deep in my pelvis, it seemed to be worse with movement and I was beside myself with what to do. I couldn‚Äôt even get to the bathroom to get painkillers because I was just in agony. This went on for several hours. 

The pain came in waves like contractions and at one point I started feeling faint, my vision went and I passed out. I called my sister, by this point throwing up and crying out like I was in labour. I‚Äôd lost all the colour from my face, my lips were virtually white, my skin was getting clammy. It was horrific 

She rushed over ready to take me to emergency, but by this point the pain had dramatically subsided. Apart from feeling pretty shaken up, and a bit sore, the pelvic pain had pretty much gone. 

My period wasn‚Äôt even heavy, and today I‚Äôve only had mild cramps, the same I usually get with my periods. To add, there‚Äôs absolutely no chance I‚Äôm pregnant. 

I am wondering if a cyst ruptured, but I‚Äôm starting to panic after reading about it online. There‚Äôs lots of sites saying if the pain is excruciating, if you‚Äôre feeling faint and vomiting, it could be a sign of bleeding internally or a more serious rupture that needs medical attention.

I will be booking into see my doctor on Monday, however I‚Äôm not in pain anymore and I just know the minute I say it coincided with me starting my period, they‚Äôll tell me it was period pain. It absolutely was not just period pain. I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs worth pursuing, but at the same time I‚Äôm worried about what I‚Äôve read! 

For anyone who‚Äôs experienced a ruptured cyst, does the above sound familiar? Did you have any complications or needed to go to emergency?

It bothers me how much society shames women 30 plus, but won't acknowledge any issues with advanced paternal age. Seeing men saying they still want children in their forties, but a woman who says the same would get that ""biological clock"" lecture. 

It is especially upsetting seeing this shaming when you look at how older women are having to deal with the inflation rates we are seeing. More women are having to wait until they are much older than they would like to be able to become mothers. You see this misogynist rhetoric that puts young women on a pedestal because they believe women solely exist to be incubators. But this rhetoric also seems to think that men are not affected by any reproductive issues as they age. Men apparently become ""more appealing"" when it is really about people in general finally having the resources to have children. Again, we obsess about shaming older mothers for this, but we never tell men that are forty plus that maybe the boat has sailed for them as well.

Review Article on Robotic-assisted Urologic Surgery

Robotic-assisted repair of pelvic organ prolapse: a scoping review of the literature

Jeffrey S. Schachar,¬†Catherine A. Matthews



Robotic-assisted total hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy have been associated with higher rates of mesh exposure (please see complication section of paper) (41,49,50) but lower rates of recurrent anterior vaginal wall prolapse. In a retrospective cohort study of 83 women undergoing robotic supracervical versus total hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy, those in the supracervical group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of recurrent anterior compartment prolapse (41.9%¬†vs.¬†20.0%, P=0.03) (51). Similarly, in a prospective cohort study of women undergoing robotic-assisted


This says 100% of the patients had pain during sex and when the mesh was taken out 100% had started to degrade 




https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6585787/

In a recent publication, Milani¬†et¬†al. note that the mesh erosion rate increases over time, from 17% at one year to 42% at seven¬†years. The study also highlights the fact that nearly half the women with mesh erosion remained asymptomatic. This underwrites the complex relationship between the presence of a trigger for pain and the clinical expression of pain in the individual patient.10

Conclusions:¬†Although 60% of women report pain resolution >2 years after surgery, de novo pain was present in 1 of 5 women. Baseline history of pain or dyspareunia is the only factor associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing pain >2 years after surgery.

Urogynecologic 
Surgical Mesh: 
Update on the Safety and Effectiveness 
of Transvaginal Placement for Pelvic 
Organ Prolapse 

Safety 
The literature review identified the following safety concerns with transvaginally placed surgical 
mesh for POP repair:
¬∑ Patients who undergo POP repair with mesh are subject to mesh-related complications 
that are not experienced by patients who undergo traditional surgery without mesh [7-9, 
15, 16, 19-24].
¬∑ Adverse events associated with transvaginally placed mesh can be life-altering for some 
women [13, 14, 17]. Sequelae (e.g., pain) may continue despite mesh removal. 



¬∑ Mesh-associated complications are not rare. ******


The most common mesh-related 
complication experienced by patients undergoing transvaginal POP repair with mesh is 
vaginal mesh erosion [7-9, 15, 16, 19-24]. Based on data from 110 studies including 
11,785 women, approximately 10 percent of women undergoing transvaginal POP repair 
with mesh experienced mesh erosion within 12 months of surgery [23].
¬∑ More than half of the women who experienced erosion from non-absorbable synthetic 
mesh required surgical excision in the operating room. Some women required two to 
three additional surgeries [23]. 


¬∑ Mesh contraction, causing vaginal shortening, tightening, and/or vaginal pain in 
association with transvaginal POP repair with mesh, is increasingly reported in the 
literature [13, 17]. 
¬∑ New onset SUI has been reported to occur more frequently following mesh augmented 
anterior repair compared to traditional anterior repair without mesh [12].
¬∑ Transvaginal surgery with mesh to correct vaginal apical prolapse is associated with a 
higher rate of complication requiring reoperation and reoperation for any reason 
compared to traditional vaginal surgery or sacral colpopexy [20]. 


¬∑ Abdominal POP surgery using mesh (sacral colpopexy) appears to result in lower rates of 
mesh complications compared to transvaginal POP surgery with mesh, with the median 
vaginal mesh erosion rate reported at 4 percent within 23 months of surgery [22].



FDA Benefit/Risk Assessment
Surgical mesh placed in the anterior vaginal compartment to treat POP is a permanent implant in the 
case of polypropylene mesh and a semi-permanent implant in the case of biologic mesh. To assess the 
benefit/risk of an individual device of this type, the FDA believes a comparison should be made to native 
tissue repair either through a randomized control trial or parallel cohort study. The FDA believes this 
comparison is important to establish favorable benefit/risk, because the use of surgical mesh should 
offer an advantage over the same repair without use of mesh. This advantage may be specific to a 
certain patient population or over the lifetime of the repair.
As evidenced by the literature review, the risk profile for mesh is less favorable compared to native 
tissue repair. Mesh erosion/exposure is a risk specific to patients who undergo a mesh repair and 
occurs at a rate of approximately 11-18%. Mesh erosion/exposure may require surgical revision and/or 
removal, which puts patients with these devices at greater risk for reoperation for all indications 

(recurrence and erosions/exposure). In addition, some types of adverse events for mesh are likely to 
increase over time as compared to native tissue repair, given the mesh is intended to remain in place for 
the rest of the patient‚Äôs life. 

Evidence from RCTs demonstrate that at 12, 24, and 36 months, safety 
outcomes favor native tissue repair. In addition, new-onset mesh-specific adverse events 
(erosions/exposures) can occur as late as the third year postoperation. 
To comprehensively evaluate 
safety between mesh and native tissue repair, the FDA believes that all adverse events (not just those 
designated as device or procedure related adverse events) should be considered, along with their 
severity/seriousness, timing, resolution, and relatedness to the device and/or procedure.

1708794760.0,How to be assertive with male vet ,"My partner and I have a 14yo Chihuahua who has a congenital heart defect. It's been stable for years, but is rapidly deteriorating as of late. 

The last time I saw the vet with my partner (December ) I was asking for comfort care meds for him. He then was crying and whimpering nonstop during the day, and it was distressing us both as I work from home. The vet refused other than upping his cough medicine, as there was fluid in the lungs.

His only advice to me was that I should *treat him like old people who need extra attention* and *carry him around like a baby* during the day. If not for my partner's relationship with the vet, I would have let him know exactly what I thought about his recommendation. And, reluctantly, I have been carrying the dog around the house, giving it constant attention and now even hand feeding it. (Cuz what kind of azz hat would just refuse?)

Caregiving for this dog with very complex needs has burnt me out. I have lost an entire week to things pertaining to the dog, while my partner still goes out with family and friends after work/on weekends, leaving me at home with him at night as well. For example, I just shot down plans for my partner to *go to the casino hours away* on Sunday. I told my partner that the dying dog's needs come before their own social ones, and that I am absolutely done with nursing it along. I mean it.

I am absolutely done doing DIY hospice here. I just lost my Dad and was manipulated into caregiving with him as well, and was the only one involved. Handfeeding the dog triggers the happiness of hope followed by waves of despair because the dog continually worsens and I see the inevitable on the horizon. My partner usually sees the struggle but acts asif I am being dramatic.

I told my partner that I am quitting this (imo ridiculous) farce of play doctor and nurse with the dog. I mean it. 

I love the dog. I love myself more. 

I feel like both the vet and my partner are projecting some gendered values on me and I have officially resigned.

I explained to my partner that I will just go stay at my Dad's if necessary. I can't live with myself feeling like I am neglecting this dog for 45 hours a week and I also can't play doctor or work magic.

The vet's relationship is with my partner, who is the bill payer. 

We see the vet shortly. I need help with articulating that if we bring him home today, there needs to be a plan of care in place that is not hinged on me because I will go stay at my Dad's.

ESPECIALLY when you are young, BREAK UP! Never settle! You will NEVER be happy if you settle. A baby with a man you settled for is NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY YOU SETTLED!

High standards are awesome and you SHOULD have them. You do NOT owe anyone a relationship! Being with you is a privilege! HE WILL NOT SUDDENLY LEARN TO RESPECT YOU ONE DAY. So BREAK UP.

Focus on having a good life for YOURSELF. Why waste your time and energy on a relationship that no longer serves you when you can BREAK UP?!??????

I have a boss who seems to be interested in me a bit. We don't know each other well, we've talked in person 4 times during 1-2h conversations since meeting 2 weeks ago.

When i first met him i had a crush on him because he was a bit cold but also generous. my fav.

But then he started to show more interest in me and uses emojis in his texts and is almost like.. too ""caring"" in a way that feels unnatural. i suspect he's a player. We work in sales which is literally just all about how to manipulate people and he's great at it.

When i talk to him in person i genuinely view him as a very solid person and think ""wow i want to be with this person romantically"" but over text or when i'm thinking about him i feel very uncomfortable and detect instability.

I am very confused about him overall. I don't know how much of it is my generalised anxiety disorder and how much is my intuition.

1708753418.0,If you are considering dating a man with kids: don‚Äôt. ,"So let me caveat this by saying my personal experience on this issue is from the stepdaughter perspective, but I saw firsthand how deeply traumatizing it was for me AND my stepmother. Especially because she was originally the affair partner. She did a shit job and added to the abuse I experienced from my own mother, but I've come to realize that she was set up to fail. 

There was no way she could've won. That doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs off the hook for her problematic behavior, but I feel better now that I understand what was happening. Our experience is not unique; 70% of remarriages with existing kids end in divorce. If you want to have a happy life, for the love of god, don't do it. Here's a little bit about what these blended families are really like:

The most important thing to realize is that divorce is traumatizing for kids on its own. A scary amount of kids are also further abused by the adults in their life beyond the trauma of divorce. They are made vulnerable by isolation, and a not insignificant amount of divorces involve at least one abusive parent. This means that you WILL be expected to raise a traumatized kid that you don't yet have a bond with. You will probably have to deal with garbage behavior from a kid you don't even know - things like hitting, drugs, screaming fights, hot and cold behavior, and overall acting out. It's horrible for bio parents to deal with - you do not want to sign up for doing it with no real bond or authority. Even if they don‚Äôt have the acting-out-from-abuse extreme behaviors (I didn‚Äôt), parenting in general is still beyond difficult. Oh, and don't forget the kids will understandably resent you and may never acknowledge your efforts. They may never like you or even be cordial. They may actively hate you for the rest of your life. 

Your husband will probably not do jack shit to help you. It's a pretty universal stepmom experience: the dad does NOTHING to address his kid's trauma responses, but simultaneously expects you to do everything for his kids. Imagine the typical emotional and domestic labor imbalance, but with kids that hate you and the dad won't do any parenting. And you don't have the relationship OR the parental backing to do anything meaningful to help/parent the kids. Because that's what most of these relationships are like. It‚Äôs the nanny bangmaid x1000.

You are going to have to coparent, as a complete outsider, with the birth mom. Most divorces are not nice experiences. The two parents often end up hating each other and there is a lot of conflict between the two parties. Then add in you and it becomes even more of a shit show. It's a lot for stable birth moms to deal with, especially when the dad sucks. Or infidelity was involved. With a stable birth mom, you will likely have at least some conflict, at least at first. But you may not get a stable birth mom - you might get an insane one. That's what my mom was and I genuinely think it gave my stepmom and dad PTSD. She was an active drug addict who faked seizures during important events to get attention and would frequently just...not show up to pick up or drop off her kids. There were times when none of us knew if she was even alive. Imagine being deeply tied to someone like that for the entire duration of your relationship.

You will almost certainly add to the trauma of already traumatized kids. This is the part where I admittedly struggle with empathy. There is absolutely a reason that the evil stepmother trope exists, and it‚Äôs not (all) just misogynistic bullshit. It‚Äôs the predictable outcome of adults doing a shit job of handling an impossible situation, unintentionally damaging innocent kids for life. I think most stepmoms probably go in with good intentions, although there are some that hate their stepkids from the start for no reason. But let‚Äôs say you are one of the ones that wants to create a new, loving family. There are a a few likely scenarios:

1. You try and try and try to accept your stepkids as one of your own. But they hate you and it‚Äôs been years with no behavioral improvement. Your husband doesn‚Äôt do any parenting when the kids call you a bitch for the 500th time. The situation is out of control and you just can‚Äôt take it anymore. Or maybe the birth mom adds so much stress to the situation that you just shut down. Whatever it is, you end up snapping. You either become abusive or completely disengage. It‚Äôs sometimes a lovely combo of both - a lot of the stepparents over on r/stepparents describe batshit insane behavior like completely ignoring the children‚Äôs existence or making it more than clear how much they are resented. Neither response is appropriate and that‚Äôs precisely WHY you shouldn‚Äôt even attempt being a stepparent - because they are traumatized children, you are an adult, and no matter how much they suck, you still can‚Äôt abuse them. None of this is their fault. You can‚Äôt marry their father, decide it‚Äôs too hard (which it probably is), and then act like they aren‚Äôt people when it‚Äôs a predictably terrible experience. This isn‚Äôt even an issue confined to stepparenthood - bio parents are just as guilty. And I also shame them to hell when they choose to have a kid, can‚Äôt handle it, and end up abusive/neglectful (intentionally or not). It‚Äôs why I think most people shouldn‚Äôt be any sort of parent at all. 

2. You try and try and try‚Ä¶..blah blah blah. But instead of staying in the garbage relationship, you leave. Which is EXACTLY what you should do in the situation. Staying causes more harm. But leaving is still harmful - you are almost certainly adding to the abandonment issues and general instability that these kids already deal with. 

3. You try and it doesn‚Äôt work. Out of love for your spouse/their kids, you stay. But you are miserable and it never gets better. You become so depressed and your relationship with your spouse gets so bad that the kids are still traumatized from being in that environment. Just like they are when bio parents stay in a terrible relationship ‚Äúfor the kids‚Äù.

Yes, there are exceptions. Happy stepfamilies exist. What I‚Äôve outlined here isn‚Äôt guaranteed to happen if you marry a divorced dad. But it is the *most likely* outcome. Do you really want to risk being miserable for years and unintentionally harming traumatized children?

I hope for everyone‚Äôs sake, your answer is no.

She thought it felt benign but still scheduled a mammogram and ultrasound to be sure, and I was lucky to squeeze my way into the schedule of a top breast cancer center and get both tests performed today.

They did see a spot and have scheduled me to have a biopsy in a few weeks. The wording on the report is ‚Äúcomplex cystic and solid,‚Äù which they said means the lump itself contains both solid material and fluid. All of the providers I met with today are optimistic and said they‚Äôre thinking it‚Äôs likely benign, but since it‚Äôs ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù and almost 3cm, it‚Äôs still marked as suspicious. They mentioned possibly a fibroadenoma or galactocele, but also said there is always a chance for a solid area to be cancer, too.

They said based on other factors (it moves a lot, it has a horizontal positioning, there‚Äôs fluid in it, and there is no sign of calcifications or irregular tissue in the area surrounding the lump) that they‚Äôre thinking I have nothing to worry about, but of course I‚Äôm worrying.

1708736699.0,This Alabama IVF ruling isn‚Äôt actually about IVF,"It‚Äôs really about legally establishing that life begins at conception. That some people trying to have children via IVF‚Ä¶which ostensibly, seems like something anti-abortionists should support (you know, people who *really want* children) is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things (in their view). Pawns 

One thing we can say about the anti-abortion coalition is that they are very strategic and play the long game. They picked this because 1. it would have people up in arms, 2. Would likely be challenged, but most importantly, 3. it brings the question of life at conception up in the most direct possible way. 

They dgaf if some people seeking IVF get burned in the larger scale of what they see as some kind of holy war. Collateral damage for the greater good (in their eyes). 

I think the goal is to have this ruling challenged,  and pushed up to the conservative Supreme Court. *It‚Äôs bait.* If they succeed and the Supreme Court upholds it, (based on the current bench, *they will*)‚Ä¶well, then life begins at conception ‚Äî that would be federal law. 

Legal groups fighting this Alabama court‚Äôs ruling would actually be helping that happen, unfortunately, because it needs to be challenged to get to it‚Äôs intended final destination. If this fails, there will be other attempts. The Supreme Court is going to be very conservative for decades to come. There‚Äôs a reason they are going the legal route, and not the legislative route. They don‚Äôt need popular support this route. What they need is a line of conservative judges, and a conservative Supreme Court. 

This would actually be worse than *Dobbs v. Jackson*, which overturned *Roe v. Wade* because that case ruled that abortion is *not federally protected.* therefore, the states can pass their own laws on it (and many have). 

This case, should it make it to the Supreme Court, would go much further in reach: It would mean *the federal government agrees life begins at conception,* therefore all abortion, in any form, at any stage, including the abortion pill, would be illegal nationally, and anyone who had one in any form, would be held to the same standards and laws we have for say, murdering or assisting in murdering. Only way to override is through acts of legislation‚Ä¶and no one‚Äôs holding their breath on that. Even though a number of republicans spoke out on Dobbs, Congress did what they always do. Jack shit. I might be wrong but I‚Äôm not even sure there was any meaningful attempt to pass a law protecting abortions after Dobbs v. Jackson? Not that I can recall

If this works out for them, I‚Äôm calling it: birth control will be next. 

Edit: Some lawyers chimed in in the comments and sounds like I‚Äôm wrong about this, so my bad everyone! Carry on. Everything‚Äôs gonna be juuuust fine.

My cycle is usually pretty regular, between 28-30 days, with maybe a one-off long cycle here or there. January was pretty stressful for me, and in recent weeks myself and the person I was seeing decided to go our separate ways -so I initially attributed my period as being late due to stress.

I called my local Planned Parenthood right away, worried about the risks of being pregnant with an IUD in place. As far as I know, it hasn‚Äôt moved -I can feel the strings just fine. To my surprise, they didn‚Äôt suggest I come in today (or head to the ER) and scheduled me for Monday to confirm the pregnancy. I would have tried to get in to an OB but I don‚Äôt have one yet as I‚Äôve just switched insurance, and on top of that, it‚Äôs Friday. Obviously I will be on the lookout for cramping, bleeding, etc in the meantime.

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to make it through the weekend. I‚Äôm in shock, scared, and overwhelmed. I‚Äôve mostly been checked out all day. Sad because I‚Äôm starting graduate school in the fall, but I‚Äôm also 32 years old -I‚Äôve always imagined that if I were to ever have an unplanned pregnancy, I would keep it. If I were in a stable relationship, I would. At this point I don‚Äôt feel confident in my ex-partners ability to be a parent, much less co-parent, so will likely terminate if it comes down to it.

Anyway, I guess I won‚Äôt know more until Monday. I was hoping for some words of encouragement or advice from anyone who has been through something similar.",TwoXChromosomes
1708735722.0,Have yall noticed men do this,"Why do some guys seem like they are more affectionate/PDA with their girlfriend around other women? Like I notice this when I‚Äôm out studying, a couple will walk by, the guy looks in my direction and maybe I‚Äôll make eye contact accidentally and look away, and I immediately notice them being super touchy all of a sudden, hugging, kissing, and the girlfriend is clearly like ‚Äúwhy are you suddenly doing this‚Äù body language wise. I promise I‚Äôm not out for other hetero women‚Äôs partners, Im honestly not into 99.9% of men in any way, and I‚Äôm not giving signs I‚Äôm interested in the guy.

I literally make minimal eye contact with people in public and am usually studying, I‚Äôve been single my whole life and genuinely don‚Äôt want a partner still. So this just puzzles me, like maybe it‚Äôs just crusty men that do this? Projecting onto you because they‚Äôre the ones that are looking at you??? Idk, but I notice this a lot and I was wondering if anyone had similar experiences/anecdotes. I genuinely hate PDA so this experience literally is so unsettling to me. I‚Äôm talking a switch up in behavior btw, like they‚Äôre just standing together and then all of a sudden a guy looks over at me and after that he‚Äôs ALL OVER his girlfriend‚Ä¶ like what are you doing???

1708735028.0,Trying to change my tune to save my sanity,"The country is going to shit. I pray everyday i‚Äôll at least have my pills- if not for safe sex than for *cancer prevention.*

But alas, here i am, shivering in rage after watching the 5th video over all this ivf, abortion, contraception nonsense.

Maybe just maybe, I don‚Äôt have to make this a bad thing. in my delulu i‚Äôm simply going to say to myself:

I‚Äôm already an ‚Äúold‚Äù virgin, never knew the joys of intimacy with an actual partner yet. But guys are scary these days, i don‚Äôt trust guys anymore thanks to the horror stories out there, and apparently they still don‚Äôt make girls finish (do they even care or just genuinely don‚Äôt know how to actually?) Well‚Ä¶i don‚Äôt have that last issue wink wink. Why give that up to some secret alpha male who doesn‚Äôt care if i‚Äôm satisfied? 

Maybe i don‚Äôt got to worry about unwanted pregnancies if there‚Äôs no guy to impregnate me, and i can still have the joys of finishing and daydreaming about the perfect partner. Plus all the women these days who are empowered being single. Yeah i long for a partner but if guys are scary and so is the government, what‚Äôs the worst that can happen? be called selfish and self centered? 

If i wait till i‚Äôm over 40 and more infertile, i can be much more free and less full of worry than at my age now to date and have the intimacy i always wanted with less scares. not nonexistent, but certainly less. 

I‚Äôm uncomfortable with my body anyway. Hair where hair Really shouldn‚Äôt be and no women talks about so i feel abnormal. My deodorants aren‚Äôt helpful most days- don‚Äôt got to worry about not being fresh enough for a guy. Don‚Äôt got to worry about shaving unless i care. 

I‚Äôll save a lot of money right? And that money can always go to toys or a better living space for said guy to come to. Do i really want to be a sexually active partner while still living with my parents? blergh no thank you how embarrassing. 

I‚Äôm doing this all anyway. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to keep the streak going for hopefully a real good man to partner up with at an age where it‚Äôs naturally harder to get pregnant? Guys become better men with age right? i‚Äôll tell myself that too so i don‚Äôt got to deal with the clowns that still hang around at my age. Maybe if we are both old enough we‚Äôll be more serious about marriage and can just marry sooner so we can prove we are married to the people who want only married couples to have contraception. and guess what if they still won‚Äôt give, then i‚Äôll be too old to conceive successfully, so that‚Äôs a plus right?Maybe if i really luck out i‚Äôll get a guy with kids and just be a step mom to already older kids. Babies and toddlers may take me away from my art- a real fear that makes me rethink motherhood all together- so if the early years are done and i get to build relationships with older kids, then maybe it‚Äôll be more likely to wind up a step mom as opposed to a mom to a baby. That in my current brain don‚Äôt sound too bad. 

I‚Äôll keep telling myself this at least. This way i won‚Äôt cry in rage or disown my republican father when they inevitable take away all my rights. No shock and fear of what to do for this gal cause i‚Äôll already be single and with my existing luck in dating, will be so  for the rest of my reproductive years.

Being a quiet and introverted Black woman makes you a target of resentment not only in the workplace but among non-Black women and men in general.

1708730176.0,Chronic Yeast Infection / IUD Help?,"For the ladies that removed their IUD due to chronic yeast infections how long did you wait to see relief after removal? 

Background: I had Liletta for ~7 years with no issue. Then one day I kept getting chronic yeast infections. Around this time I had a new partner and would mostly use condoms. Flucanazole and metronidazole did nothing to help with the chronic BV and YI. About 3 months later I had a second new partner and still the issues continued despite continued treatment. My doctor then finally prescribed me weekly flucanazole. There was a point where I was feeling better but just to ensure it wouldn‚Äôt come back I decided to remove my IUD. During that same visit the doctor took a vaginal culture in which BV and YI came back positive. (She had previously tested me for mycoplasma and STIs etc came back negative). She stated it was probably because that was taken while the IUD was still inside. After I finished the antiobitics for the BV, I felt itchy and needed to take another flucanazole pill in addition to my regular weekly dose to feel better. 

It‚Äôs only been a week since I‚Äôve had my IUD removed and still exhibiting symptoms but from most comments on prior discussions it seems that women found almost immediate relief? I‚Äôm just wondering if that is the case. I‚Äôve been suffering from chronic yeast and BV for about 9 months now and I‚Äôm absolutely devastated. Any help or insight would be appreciated! Thanks!

But somehow I tumbled through the tiktok algorithm of women who were tradwives until their husbands lost interest. It‚Äôs so sad to see women who followed all of the rules (for girls) in their communities- married too young to finish their education or get any work experience. Starting having kids that tethered them more and more to the man that she‚Äôs not allowed to exist outside of. But then she turns 40, or 30, or gains 50lbs between marriage and baby 5, OR he grows tired of her for whatever reason. 


And she has no options. He‚Äôs living in the world and understands the system. He has an education and work experience. She has real skills of motherhood, of cooking, managing a house. But in late stage capitalism she‚Äôs not employable. 


And I‚Äôm seeing these cautionary tales on these tiny platforms, but how is that supposed to compare to high traffic bs staged content of tradwife influencers baking bread, and collecting eggs, and frolicking in some tick-infested prairie? It makes me so scared for young women because they still have to put up with all of the same predators that young women have always faced, but this specific sinister trend is slithering its way to mainstream young women- including those who were not even raised in these communities and never would have considered the option if not for ring lights and subtle makeup and aesthetic cooking and baking. I am scared for her because she doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs getting really into- obviously in the hard labor reality of doing this romanticized lifestyle- but also the actual real consequences of what happens when her husband discards her 


Please let me know your thoughts.

I would like to think that I have a decent pain tolerance due to dealing with migraines and bad periods, but I‚Äôm just so anxious about the unknown.

I have to return to work after the appointment, but luckily I can work from home. For what it‚Äôs worth, I don‚Äôt even feel Pap smears other than the speculum being in there. My gyno mentioned that I could get a lidocaine shot before insertion, but I almost want to just forgo that and get the whole thing over with as quickly as possible. I‚Äôm already an anxious person, especially when it comes to medical procedures, and this is consuming my brain. I have to fly out for a work trip the next morning which is also making me anxious.

But I remember feeling so guilty and ashamed of doing it. I would basically just go home and flop on the bed and watch porn and masterbate. I did not feel good about myself at all barely made time for other things. I would be like okay this is the last time I‚Äôm doing this. But I would feel so dreadful for some reason.

I had blocked memories over something that happened. I also wouldn‚Äôt really eat. Just a lot of emotional dysfunction and dysregulation. 

I‚Äôm older now. I kind of got over the shame. Mainly because I opened up to some people. I think it can serve a good purpose but I really just do it to avoid my responsibilities. I shouldn‚Äôt be masterbating when I know I have work to do. This is not healthy. 

I know a lot of discussion about this topic is centered around men. 

I saw a video a while ago that was talking about how most men view it in isolation and use it as a self-soothing mechanism. Well I think that describes me back in high school. I was definitely trying to self soothe.

I asked him if he was sure he was ready to move on or if he needed more time but he assured me that he was over her and ready to date. 

He was so forward in his messages and very affirming about his interest in me. We planned a date but he was so eager to see me and asked if we could change it to be that night instead. We went out and had a really good time! He asked me so many questions and it felt like there was a spark & deep connection there.

He claimed that men make better choices than women because men have no problem choosing partners who have a financially lower status than them but women almost never do that.

1708715344.0,Hard day..,"Oh boy... 

This is gonna be a Doozey! So brace yourself!

I (36) F am separating from my boyfriend (46). 

It has been a very hard year. I had just moved back from Colorado after an abusive relationship.  In fact, every relationship I've been in has been abusive. I was staying with my best friend and after a couple months I met a man (now ex). 

He seemed very interesting and like a breath of fresh air. He owns a contracting business, travels, and we had a lot in common. 

Things started like a frickin' Disney movie. He swept me off my feet. 

After a few months, the verbal abuse started.  Anytime I would speak passionately about something, I was told to be quiet, I was talking to much. He would, however, talk for hours on end, and if you said anything at all during that time, it'd be followed by a lecture about interrupting people.

He drinks heavily. I do on and off, but really pulled back from it. He still drinks 2 shots of tequila every 2 hours throughout the day till night. He drove away his 3 kids, M(22) M(20) F(19). They won't communicate with him at all. 

He seems smart and caring but then it changes to dominance.  I am a independent thinker, and he says I have to do exactly what he wants or says, otherwise I don't know how to treat a man. A woman is to be submissive to her man. Otherwise you aren't giving him respect. 

He made me cut my hair. Use to be long, now it's short. But then he'd turn around and take me on trips. Buy me some stuff. Then turn around when he's angry and say that I owe him and we'll never be equal.

He kept me from my friends, saying that their trash, but they've always been good to me and been there for me. In fact, this afternoon I'm moving back in with them.

He says I'm too close to my daughter and that I'm teaching her to be dependent on my love. He says I pet my cat too much and shouldn't love an animal, because it's an animal, it's meant to work. Nothing more.

I feel so messed up in the head. My other abusive relationships would hit me. That's an easy answer, get out. I would and rebuild. Then some were very obvious with verbal abuse, daily derogatory name calling and insults, followed by some physical abuse. That took some back n forth but ultimately knew, get out. I would and rebuild.

I thought for the first 6 months this guy was the one, and then everything the last 6-8 months now has been just mentally detoriating. I almost feel crazy but then my daughter (14) and such a smart girl, sent me the following;

""And he dresses you and he makes you do a hair style he likes and he flirts with other girls and he's a dickhead and he wants to change everything abt u so he can turn u into something you aren't even though he should've js fallen in love with the women he met and he tries to cover up his bad behavior by taking us on trips and buying us stuff""

My kid. She gets it. And that made me realize I have to stick to my guns and be strong and show her, I am independent,  I will never submit to anyone. Respect isn't losing your identity to bow down to another's needs, it's mutual compromise and developing together.

I don't even know why I posted this. I'm at work and the ex texted that all my stuff is thrown in the yard (it's muddy out) and I'm not off work for another 4 hours to deal with it. So just needed to vent so I don't cry at work. ",TwoXChromosomes

1708709779.0,I feel completely unwanted. ,"I have been struggling with my emotions about how my father has abandoned me. And how my family views me and how I‚Äôm treated. I just can‚Äôt seem to bring myself to not blame me, for the fact that my dad never bonded with me. My mom has always been at my side, but there was a time where she treated me so badly, that I left. Ever since I was young my dad has always had some sort of ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs from your mom‚Äù thing to say about my behavior. Especially if I lied or did something dishonest , it was immediately because of my mom.  When I wanted to see her , I was in the wrong and I didn‚Äôt appreciate him enough. My father hated my feminine tendencies as a child (I am a trans woman) and would constantly redirect me. I felt bad about this because at the time nobody else had any problems with how I behaved. Other adults I met in school seemed to not mind at all. So it felt like my dad was stopping me from doing what I wanted to do. Wouldn‚Äôt even let me play a clarinet because that was too ‚Äúgirly‚Äù. My parents loved me when they thought I was just maybe a little feminine or gay. I did eventually discover what trans was. When I did I was filled with excitement and joy. I was so excited to do these things I always wanted. I believe I was 14 then, and I never said anything because I was so afraid of making my dad disappointed. My friends in school had entirely embraced me. I had an online life. I remember being convinced after hearing so many other people‚Äôs coming out stories that I could have a dad who loves me for me. The day I came out at 16 he left home. He didn‚Äôt come back for a while. When he did come back he ignored me to my face for like a week.  I even pleaded. My step mom then informed me that I‚Äôve ruined his professional image because the parents from my school are confronting him because I am trans. After I became 18 the idea that my dad had probably stopped loving me was tangible. I left , moved in with a stranger who did unacceptable things to me in my sleep. When I tried to come home I was told that I  must be on drugs and to not come back. I served two years in the military(left early)  for which I sadly went into the closet. Couldn‚Äôt have served trans anyhow at the time because of policy that year He loved me again it seemed, but it was impossible to forget how easily he could leave me behind. I got back to transitioning once out. I was shunned, and he literally cut contact with me. Leaving me on read for actually 4 years.  He recently reached out to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not ugly, you look a lot like your mom‚Äù and tried to make up. He is back to ignoring me again. I feel narcissistic for wanting to feel precious to my father. Again I‚Äôm being told he just can‚Äôt accept it. After him opening up and saying what he said I‚Äôm just more hurt. My boyfriend thinks I should give up on him, but the sad reality is I love my dad still , and I just can‚Äôt bring myself to cut him off. ",TwoXChromosomes

I talked to my husband. He apologized and said he didn't realize it was that upsetting for me because it's normal in his culture. He promised that in the future he'll be more aware and step in when he sees them making similar comments. 

Also after HOURS of deep diving on the internet, I realized that my skin issues were probably due to fungal acne and not hormonal like I had previously thought. I said ""fuck it"" and gave the viral head and shoulders treatment a try. You guys. A week in with head and shoulders and my skin has 95% cleared up after almost a year of issues.

1708701822.0,"I don‚Äôt want to move to my husband‚Äôs country and we might have to split up over it, I‚Äôm gutted","(On mobile) Long vent ahead, any advice welcome üñ§
I‚Äôm (26) from the US and my husband (25) is from a small EU country. We met staying in the same hostel two years ago and been head over heels since. 

I like his country, but I‚Äôm from a warm, bustling city and he grew up in rural, cold towns. The first year, we traveled back and forth to visit each other before we tied the knot in his country. It was fun getting see new places, but we wanted to live together. His country has great social welfare and is therefore difficult to move to as non-EU. We moved to Ireland instead since English is our common language. We‚Äôve been here since last spring and, simply put, everything that could have gone wrong has. We found an apartment and signed a lease with another local couple but found the landlord is shady and stolen over ‚Ç¨8k from us. We have a case against him w tenant‚Äôs union but it‚Äôs moving slow. It took my husband very long to find a basic retail job to the point it complicated my visa here. Since I‚Äôm still not a resident, I pay high taxes (that would be refunded when I would get my resident card) and make about ‚Ç¨7/hr while rent is more than I‚Äôve ever paid. 

But mostly I just HATE it here. I wasn‚Äôt ready for the cold winter and it was very hard. I started an MA program at a school I liked but the stress of the hw/being unable to keep up with tuition payments caused me to withdraw. I don‚Äôt like my job, we never planned to stay here forever so we aren‚Äôt working towards better careers here or having a car, etc. We barely make enough money for bills; with my high taxes I‚Äôve been draining all the savings I had. We can‚Äôt afford to go out, so we stay at home and cook/have Netflix nights and our only friends are our roomies. My computer just went out of warranty and broke, but I can‚Äôt afford to fix/replace it. The government is very difficult to deal with as I can only communicate for my visa application via snail mail. We live in a city but it‚Äôs nothing compared to the ‚Äúfast life‚Äù I had before.

His family came to visit us a couple weeks ago and he told them I‚Äôm struggling. They‚Äôve offered to loan us the legal fees required for me to be able to move to his country, and as kind as the offer is, I‚Äôm not ready to do it. He would make much better wages there and rents are low, but I don‚Äôt speak the language well and it would be hard for me to find work. It would be a great place to raise a family, but we don‚Äôt want kids. The cold here was hard, and I‚Äôd be signing up for even worse winters for the 10-12 years it would take to become a citizen. I miss my city, my friends, and my sister/best friend just had a baby and I want to be there to watch her grow‚Ä¶ 

We talked about him moving to the US with me but obvi USCIS is also notoriously difficult/expensive. He was so open to it but changing his tune as he highly values family and has little sibs he wants to be there for. He said even the two hour flight from here to there is too far. 

He is the most wonderful husband in the world‚Ä¶ Thoughtful, encouraging, SEXY, incredibly patient through my seemingly endless tears this year. His family is great and have welcomed me warmly from the beginning, and mine to him.

It doesn‚Äôt sit right that I‚Äôd forfeit our relationship for what may be FOMO or something silly. If my visa doesn‚Äôt come through soon, I‚Äôll have to leave and our fams have been asking for updates on plans. (His expecting us to move near them, mine expecting us to go to the US.) 

We had the nicest day together yesterday, but sometimes just looking at him I cry thinking I might not have him much longer. I‚Äôm a high emotions type girly and I‚Äôm spinning out. We‚Äôre going crazy trying to think of other options but I‚Äôm scared saying goodbye is inevitable. Losing him AND his loving family is terrifying to me. I‚Äôve never lost a relationship simply based on circumstances; it feels selfish saying it‚Äôs too hard for me. Going home broke and alone doesn‚Äôt seem any better.

1708700250.0,I (20F) can't tell if this guy(19M) likes me and wants to pursue a relationship,"Hi all ! Just FYI there's gonna be some slight TMI details but its nothing crazy, more funny than anything. so i (20F) met this guy (19M) off bumble, and we had a great energy going throughout our conversations throughout there, so after about a week I gave him my number. He goes to a neighboring college that's actually pretty close to my apartment, and that I'd had plans on transferring to in the fall semester anyways. Our first ""date"" we just went for a  walk around the school campus, which i actually really liked because its a beautiful campus. And that's when I learned that he's actually a lot more shy in person then over text, he's very quiet and i would classify myself as a yapper, but he says he likes to listen to me talk so its not an issue. We continue to text every day after that date and we do eventually hang out again and we have sex. We've hung out 4 times and have had sex on 2 separate occasions. I honestly really like him I think he's sweet and a good listener and funny, and we have similar interests.

Here is where i would say the issue arises. I cant tell if he feels the same way. I did send a text after the first time we had sex asking him if it was just a hookup or if he wanted to continue talking, and he said ""i enjoy talking to you 100%, its just sucks that its hard to hangout with our packed schedules and neither of us having a car"" He's a first year who lives in a dorm, while I'm a second year who works to pay bills and is in school. And there's nothing wrong with that ! most first years don't do that anyways, he's also an out of state student. He also plays lacrosse for his college so he has class everyday, lacrosse practice most days, and games on the weekend that are sometimes out of state. And again, neither of us have cars and while I do have an electric scooter, there isn't a ton to do thats walking distance for him and ubers tend to add up.

I guess I'm just slightly confused on how he feels, because he started watching my favorite shows that I recommended, he listens to the music I recommend, one time after we had sex he let me tie a ribbon into a bow onto his dong üò≠üò≠and kept it on until it fell off while he peed. I also put a sticker on him and he kept it on after he went home and slept with it until it fell off in the shower. But then on the other hand, when we first started talking (its been a month since we matched) we texted each other first 50/50 but now it seems more 70/30 me texting him after i say goodnight. i guess my main question is does he like me enough and is just busy ? or is  this even worth pursuing ?

I have recently seen some tiktoks of guys with gorgeous long hair being approached from behind, and not going to lie, theirs looked SO much healthier than women's in general.

With the existence of pink tax, etc I started wondering: Have corporations been making us THINK we need all these products, not just shamppo and conditioner, but also leave in conditioner, etc, and ADDING things to it that damages our hair to make us feel we need the extra product to ""repair"" the damage to the shit they put in? An extra pink tax FU to women?

So, for the last week I have been using my fiance's 3 in 1, and let me tell you, I noticed IMMEDIATE results after the FIRST TIME, a week later I am so fuming! After the first couple days I got to thinking.. it's face and body too... if I wash my face with it while in the shower as I wash my hair, will it also work better on my face?

Y'all... yes.

For SO LONG companies have been pushing that we women NEED all this different and many times expensive crap they are pushing at us to have healthy hair and skin, while making it easy AF for men. Adding that shit to the  misogenistic narrative.

I am damned near foaming at the mouth with rage at all the money we women have been wasting while they rake in tons of $, ESP when these days just surviving is a struggle, and they still expect us to spend a ton of $ on ""cosmetics.""

So, first. I am well aware that everyone's body is different and my approach won't work for everyone. 

The whole point of my post was for those that it WOULD work for and are currently stuck in the ""I need all this product because the cosmetic industry says I do!"" mindset. If my experience can help others? Save them tons of money and time a year, why not share and try to help?

1708674190.0,Angry and upset at the patriarchy ,"Hi everyone, sorry in advance for any grammatical errors. English is not my native language. 

I've been following this reddit for a while and found it such a safe en welcoming place. I need a place to vent so i hope I can do that here. 

So last week I went partying and ran into one of my partners best friends and former roommate. Since he lives nearby we decided to share a cab. In the cab he touched me inappropriatly. I froze so I didnt move his hand away but I clearly stated 'no, stop' and he continued.

Of course when I came home I woke my partner and told him everything. My initial response was being sad for my partner for his friends 'betrayal'. Luckily my partner en one of my close friends whom I told, pressed me on how f'ed up this situation was for me. And to stop think int about other people. 

After a day or two this realisation really set in and all my emotions came out. I was so angry at the world. This isnt the first time this happened to me and now, with someone who I should be able to trust, it happened again. 

Of course I wanted to go no contact with this person immediatley. My partner and I were kinda hoping he would text or call to apologize but... Nothing. He sent me a text to remind me to pay my share of the taxi and he sent texts to my partner about his upcoming birthday. The sheer audacity. 

So, I decided to send him a text saying what happened wasn't okay and he needs professional help. I told him dont bother with apologies, dont text or call, I'm blocking you. Within 5 minutes he was calling my partner. He gave some bullshit excuses and when my partner said I dont want to see you again but I hope you look for help, he wasn't willing to. We gave him the option to share this situation with our mutual friends himself. Since he didnt immediatly I contacted some close friends of us myself. Mostly women or couples, since I'm really scared he will be doing this again.

Most women were outraged but the men gave such bullshit underwhelming responses. They dont mean bad but... One of my female friends texted me about how sweet it was that my partner called with this person since 'that must have been difficult for him to do'. Sweet??? That shit should be normal. And difficult for him? Sure, but maybe dont say that to the person who got grabbed... Again, I'm not angry at them personally, this is just what the patriarchical system created.

I'm spiralling so much about how people are reacting, how I reacted in the first place, how I want to share this with my parents but they have short sighted views so I dont dare to. I'm just angry about the whole thing.

I always told him that made me feel insecure and asked him if it really smelled. He'd always say ""no of course it doesn't, I wouldn't be joking about it if it actually did."" 

I remember once I was looking at his shoulder and he has this bone popping out of it. I jokingly said ""haha it looks weird"" and he was quick to respond ""your vagina looks weird"". His comment made me stupid cry because in the past I used to feel insecure about how it looked. He was trying to comfort me, telling me he was kidding, that he was sorry and that he likes the way it looks. ""It's pretty, not weird at all"". After I forgave him, he would make fun that I got offended by something so minor, calling it ""cute"". 

For the most part my (ex) bf made me feel good about my physical looks. He would call me the prettiest when I would feel my ugliest, like in the mornings when my hair was a mess and I had no make up on. It was just these ""jokes"" that I think about every now and then that make me wonder if I was overreacting. I never joked about his intimate areas. I feel like i'lll be insecure the next time I become intimate with another man. Will he think it smells weird? Will he think it looks funny? Even though I know my vagina is healthy per my doctor, I'll always feel insecure.

1708668173.0,Disconnected from my body almost year after medical abortion/TW: graphic description' mentions of abuse,"I want to preface this by saying if you are unsure of getting an abortion or are planning on getting one and are nervous, DO NOT READ FURTHER. I made the decision to get an abortion and though it was tough, it was absolutely the best decision for me. There is no regret that lives in me for making this decision. 

\*\*\*\*\*

I had a medical abortion a little under a year ago, and though I don't regret it, it was probably the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I was in no position to mentally deal with a pregnant or a become a mom.

I feel immense guilt for feeling this way. I am lucky to live in a state that is pro-choice where I have the option to make decisions for my body and my life. I don't want anyone to not get abortion because of what I am expressing. It was still undoubtedly the right thing for me. I know a lot of people don't have the access to options like I had. I just feel like garbage to whine about it but I need community and to receive support.

I have a history of abuse as a child and adult and have been diagnosed with PTSD from another event. And yet I think the abortion was the most traumatic thing I've ever done through. I am also neurodivergent and think that part of why this felt so traumatic and played on a loop is because of my neurodivergence. I don't know how to explain it, but I felt my body too much. Even now, when I think about the experience, I clench and have to physically shake to get myself from replaying it in my head.

I feel terrified of my body. Not because I feel I will get pregnant again, but because I saw what it was capable of. I physically don't feel the same down there. The whole thing plays on a loop in my head and has for months. I see giant clots the size of lemons coming out of me. Having to wear adult diapers and sit in my own clots. Screaming from the pain. Not being able to go to the bathroom with my partner holding my hand. He had to fucking help bathe me for days because I was too scared to stand up straight. Thinking the clots were finally done and having a huge glob slip out of me when I was going into a meeting. Having to pretend everything was okay at said meeting. 

I thought I was dying. When the second pill kicked in, I literally thought I was going to fucking die. I was not mentally or physically prepared to go through how painful my experience was. I thought it would feel like a slightly heavier period. That's what I was told by the medical staff. Instead, it felt like my cervix was melting and ripping and screaming. I'm almost happy I wasn't told how painful it was going to be. 

The abortion itself was physically painful, but what followed devastates me. My hormones have completely changed. My medical provider is too cheap to send me in for hormonal testing and I am far too depressed to try to keep up with urging them to do something. My antidepressants are beyond useless and my medication for my skin are about the same. I'm having an evener harder time than usual facing the distrust my doctors have for my account of what is going on with my body.

I have zero sex drive. I used to be ready to go all the time. In the past year, I maybe have had sex with my partner 8 times as opposed to every other night. I feel so guilty. When we do have sex, it is painful and I usually end of crying because I can't function correctly. I'm terrified of going to the OBGyn because if sex is this painful, I don't want to get a pap. 

My skin is riddled with cystic acne from the hormonal change. I can't lose weight no matter what I try. I hate being in my body and I hate looking at it. I don't recognize myself anymore. 

I genuinely don't even know if they are connected. I cannot find anything that corroborates this, but the change of everything happened immediately after the abortion.

Have I mentioned the shame? I never thought I'd experience shame because I find nothing shameful about getting an abortion. And yet, here I am. I feel dirty and stupid and shameful. 

I've been meaning to connect with reddit communities for months and months to try and cope with this trauma. I'm crying my eyes out typing this. I really hope this hasn't been anyone else's experience but if it has been, it would be nice to know I'm not alone or beyond ""repair"".

At 32 years old I am embarrassed to say that I have only just begun to explore why‚Ä¶Granted, my very early attempts did not go well as I will explain in more detail below. My first period at age 12 lasted about 4 months and since then 2-4 months with about a month off in between was the norm until I finally started BC. The worst part is not the duration, it‚Äôs the severity of the bleeding and other symptoms. Pads and tampons are almost useless even when combined or layered, and I‚Äôve tried virtually every kind under the sun. I had to wear adult diapers from middle school on. When the blood wasn‚Äôt coming out like water I was passing clots as big as my palm. The pain is excruciating; not just the pelvic cramping but full body pain that makes it hard to move along with some more unpleasant symptoms. I had trouble maintaining weight because it would be so difficult to keep food down. I have passed out more times than I can count and have ended up in the ER a number of times after hitting my head on the way down. They never bothered to run any tests; just treated my anemia and suggested that I see an OBGYN (wasn‚Äôt an option at the time due to the dynamics of the household I was stuck in). When I was finally able to take myself to see an OBGYN at the age of 18, his response to this issue was ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still young. This‚Äôll get better once you‚Äôve had a kid or two.‚Äù That‚Äôs all fine and dandy except for the minor issue of me (and my now husband) not wanting kids. To be honest, I just kind of gave up after that. I did what I‚Äôd always done, dealt with it. I did initially think that it was something that I would grow out of, but each year it just got worse. When it got so bad that I almost had to quit my job, I finally used Nurx to start BC, which I‚Äôve now been on for about 5 years. It doesn‚Äôt fix the issue, but it does help tremendously. My periods last about 10 days, though I spot more days than not. I can use normal tampons and the pain is more what I would consider ‚Äúnormal‚Äù period pain. This, to me, was a godsend. However, in the last 2 years I have had one DVT (blood clot) and have begun having migraine like episodes (not officially diagnosed). My hematologist vehemently wants me off the BC as he feels it is the most likely culprit.

Just trying to make some conversation and set up a rapport, which was not reciprocated. She set me up for HIV testing, along with some labs. I was just in shock at the moment and kept thinking we‚Äôd talk soon, or maybe she wanted to do a f/u visit to go over the labs and she would obtain a more detailed medical history then. That was not the case, she said, ""We'll call you if any thing is abnormal"" and left.  
Went to the practice today to try to talk to someone. They offered to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the record about the drug addiction. I stated I still had other concerns. They set me up to talk to the provider about these issues one on one in a couple days. I was hoping to speak to an office manager of sorts. I‚Äôm nervous about this, upset that this happened and how I was treated , and now I have to deal with confrontation after already expressing high anxiety. I want to hear her out and give her the benefit of doubt, but given her attitude- should I just ask her to amend the records notate that I‚Äôm an alcoholic not an addict and leave the rest alone? I have some notes of things to bring up so I don't forget them. My mom told me to record the conversation but I am in a 2 party consent state and don't feel comfortable requesting the physician agree to the audio recording.

I wished I received the screenings and had those discussions she is billing the insurance company for and I feel hoodwinked. I have not taken care of my health in over 15 years, due to my alcoholism I was happy that I was in a place now to do so.

So, I always thought I was alone in my arse dagger pain during my periods. I remember mentioning this pain and getting blank looks from my friends and my mum (admittedly arse daggers may have thrown them off), but oof. Every month I would have the blood and the diarrhoea and the dreadful pain in my rectum. It was fleeting but intense, enough to take my breath away and no one was talking about it. 

Imagine my joy when today I saw a silly, animated reel showing this exact thing! All of these years I thought I was alone and long after my periods ended here was the arse dagger family I‚Äôd always hoped for!

I saw a comment explaining the pain, giving actual medical names for it! And then the advice that research had shown that asthma medication may help alleviate the pain. Well, I‚Äôve been asthmatic since I was 8 and my inhaler never helped me, so I turned to my mum and told her (again) of the arse daggers and that it was an actual thing and that apparently my ventolin inhaler should have helped and SHE SAID ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt that unhygienic?‚Äô",TwoXChromosomes

1708640932.0,In Defense of Ghosting (Great Article!)," 

I recently read a great article by Reese Weatherly that has summed up my feelings on ghosting for years perfectly. Most pertinantly, she makes the observation which has never occured to me that the entitlement to continued interaction is, in many ways, similar to that of sex or romance; that complaining about being ""friendzoned"" and being ghosted are very similar phenomena. My argument is that they disproportionately occur in a similarly gendered setting, and I'm interested in what other feminists think about the intersection between obligated interaction and patriarchy.

Personally, I have never been and will never be offended by being ghosted. Of course, if someone disappears out of the blue I might hope that they are ok, but ultimately I am not owed an explanation for someone else's absence. I think it's a really great article as well so I'll link it; feel free to discuss!

I have been overweight my entire life without fail and made the decision to have surgery when I was 21.

I‚Äôm still not comfortable approaching/being approached by anyone in real life but I am on Tinder and Hinge.

Might get a lot of hate for this but best to let it out. I am still healing from this so would appreciate kind words.

i didnt break up. i had a breakdown and so did he. i never justified anything. h was wrong, very wrong for a lot of the things that he did. the girl kept threatening him and manipulating him from behind. still it doesnt make sense for him to do what he did. he truly apologized. he takes full blame of what happened. we cried together for a very long time. i was sad and mad at him at the same time. he was there to comfort me. this wouldnt make much sense now but he promised for a better future. there were things he did on his and things he did the second i spoke about it. i didn't like that he followed people he knows even for a brief period of time (no naked models or anything), he removed half of them within a few minutes. he deleted snapchat cause he said that he would feel distracted and would not want to know updates of people's lives. he is deeply apologetic and ashamed for what he did. i screamed at him, told hi mean things, he stayed silent the entire time. i knew how my words were affecting him. i knew that he did feel bad.

ik, this might seem manipulative and crazy. i am really not ready to end things. but after this, i have known that if anything similar to this happens again, i am out. he knows this as well. he does have a real fear of losing. not using that advantage but just hoping that he will ake things right from this fear. i have multiple breakdown, even during normal times i would suddenly feel very off and be upset, he would be very caring and supportive. he calls me every night so that i dont feel sad and alone. he sends me updates of where he is and what he does. facetimes me and also stays on call while driving, all these without me asking for it.

my mom is supportive to an extent since she likes him as well for the good things that he does. my siblings are mad at me for giving him a chance. this genuinely makes me sad. i told him about this as well and he is willing to fix thing and be better for them as well.

at this point i really need assurance and hope. his efforts does give me a hope that things might be better. part of why i am being considerate of the overall situation is because i was in a similar position as well. while i was dating him my ex went crazy and would bother to text, call and meet me every now and then. gave suicide threats. i never met him but we did speak, something my bf was aware of. nothing makes sense at this point, i am trying to move past this and feel better. i hope you all are able to make me feel better as well. breakup isnt my choice or option at this stage.  


**Original:**

just found that my bf went out twice with his ex while we were dating and he never told her that we were in a relationship. they ate out outside and they hugged as well. i aw screenshots where my bf or ex now told the girl that he regrets breaking up with her and that he loved her. he messaged her that he is in a relationship they they can still keep contact. i was his student and that's how our story started. i was told that i am the first student he ever dated. he dated 3 students before. when the girl got to know about me and us, she threatened him that she will notify the institution and that he might lose his job. he feared this and met with her to calm her down. the girl still likes him. we spoke and she has a really unapologetic tone. she kept on saying how she has a weakness for him since she lost her virginity to him. my bf lied to me from the first and i just got to know this. next month is the girl's bday and also my bday, the girl asked him if he would meet her. he said yes. it would have been a year of us just after 2 days. my entire family knows about him and he recently told his family about me. things were moving forward.

if you check my other posts you will se how much i defended how an how much i truly loved him. im just so so heartbroken. i have done so much for this man. i prayed for him and his family. i really dont know how to function anymore. i have no friends and he was my everything. i was away from city for a while and he met her during that time. he cried and wanted another chance when we were on the call, apologized and begged for forgiveness. but after i hung up, he probably went to sleep and didnt call or text me.

To the issue: this is an experience that somehow has happened more than once in my life. Funny enough, each time it is upsetting not only in the same way but also in new and imaginative manners.

So I wanted to see if this is more of a me thing or a general female experience. Personally it makes me feel objectified and regarded as not human but just a thing that can fulfill some imaginary idea or social, emotional need in those mens lifes that can be discarded and interchanged for any other ‚Äúsimilar object‚Äù, aka woman.

Last instance has me a bit flabbergasted so I wanted some external perspective to know if I am maybe the ‚Äúcrazy one‚Äù. 

I myself cannot stand people (but in general I see it so much more frequently with men) who ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù with every person (in this case woman) that is nice or polite to them, both if it involves me directly or if I am a mere observer ‚Ä¶ It just feels like such a cheap sentiment of looking for any kind of attention or affection you can get from anyone or anywhere. I guess what irritates me is that there is no value or standards when looking for a partner for them, just whoever is there at any given moment and it makes me feel like those people have no character.

This last instance has been quite recent and I am a bit unsure at this point if I am being reasonable or not. This year while getting my Master‚Äôs degree I became good friends with a classmate, he is nice, smart and has some very similar cultural interests as me, as well as a very similar dark sense of humour, but he is also someone a bit akward and not always on point with social cues. It was a really good friendship, we interchanged books, made plans for visiting museums, dinners and such. Not long after he told me he liked me, which is fine, but I do not feel the same way back, which I explained in the nicest possible way, insisting especially on the fact that I am a bit older and in a different vital moment. That being said I told him that I understand that being friends with someone you like is not the easiest and if he doesn‚Äôt want to keep the friendship I can totally understand. He insisted that he was quite sure I would reject him but just wanted to take his chance anyway but that he wanted to keep being friends.

Fast forward 3 month, a girl from class who he never spoke to before asks him to help her with an assignment from a subject he is quite familiar with. He gets super excited about this, and basically starts imagining how to call their future children. Which at first seems a bit naive but cute and I support his sudden crush. The thing is he gets way too comfortable at sharing and starts talking more and more about paralelisms of when he used to like me and I start to feel bit by bit a little ick and concern.

Here are some things: turns out he decided he liked me and had to become my friend because I sat next to him once in class and spoke to him once (I don‚Äôt even remember, seems that it was just one phrase); this girls most attractive feature is that she is single as turns out was mine lol; all the plans done previously have been dropped to pursue her which only makes me think he did the same to other people while ‚Äúbecoming‚Äù my friend nevertheless they have not met  once outside of class; how do I know this, you wonder, well all our conversations became conversations about this girl and whatever she did, said or maybe thought.

I feel like this is not healthy neither for friendships or romantic relationships, and that those are no good reasons to pursue anyone, especially as an adult. I told him it made me feel uncomfortable for both me and her. He only looked down at his coffee and said ‚Äúok‚Äù. Now he does not even great me when we see each other in class.

I went over my stewards heads and have a meeting set for this Sunday with the larger union. I even invited a different department I‚Äôve been fighting for as well. I plan on asking the stewards to step down, and if they refuse the next step is a vote. On top of that I have the task of trying to encourage and uplift all these people. I need to reach them to pick themselves up, stand their ground, get angry, unite, realize our bosses are cowards and you CAN laugh in their stupid faces. I need them to understand our experience is not okay and you don‚Äôt have to accept abuse or disrespect. You don‚Äôt have to be on the defense, you can be on the offense. 

I need your help to get ready for this. I‚Äôm so freakin nervous. I‚Äôm not a public speaker, I‚Äôm not particularly inspiring. I‚Äôm facing giants and trying to change the hearts and self-value of many who are a few years away from retirement. This is what they know: be afraid. Who the fuck am I? But the larger union is behind me, I‚Äôm already working closely with those over the heads of my stewards. I just need my peers to see some light so we can dig out of this sorry hole they seem to want to be in. 

I need woman power songs. Songs that kick ass so I can pump myself up. I need encouragement. I need quotes, affirmations, mantras. I need rituals. Practices that feel like strength. Advice. If you pray or do spells or rituals, do some for me would ya? 

I‚Äôm going to try to offer to lead them and be their steward. I‚Äôm so tired of this shit. ",TwoXChromosomes

These children were born of embryos that were 30 years old, from a company that is explicitly Christian. The kind of selective decision making on who gets to reproduce that‚Äôs generally frowned upon. And the church has a lot of voting power across the states.

And that‚Äôs just one aspect of the problem. When it comes to not worrying about drastic overnight change, I think the most of us here are women who have seen what incremental change looks like when our rights are being stripped away, and giving embryos human rights counts as a step, not an end goal.

1708620263.0,My boyfriend thinks I have unfounded concerns over the possibility of being assaulted by an Uber/Lyft driver.,"TW for anyone who has actually been in this situation.

As the title says, my boyfriend thinks I'm being ridiculous when I refuse to use Uber or Lyft, especially after dark, because of the possibility I might be assaulted. I'm 5'6"", about 120 lbs, and have barely any upper body strength. I know that in the case it did happen, I would not be able to properly defend myself, so I just avoid it altogether. I've seen too many Reddit stories, articles, and statistics to take the risk. Lyft doesn't even do background checks half the time and ends up hiring known sex offenders! 

There have been more than a few occasions where my boyfriend insisted I take an Uber to or from his apartment, and they're always after dark. I don't have a car, he's tired and doesn't want to drive, etc. I always say no because I don't get in a car with strangers, especially after dark, and he always starts an argument that my concerns are unfounded and that nothing will happen to me. He doesn't understand that's not a chance I'm willing to take.

I will say he did convince me to take an Uber to a local coffee shop once, but it was during the day and the driver happened to be this sweet woman. My bf also agreed to be on-call with me the whole ride in case something happened. (I had a wireless earbud in my ear.) 

It's just so frustrating that he dismisses my safety concerns because seeing me in person, and risking danger to do so, is more important than being apart and safe. He doesn't understand the dangers women can face day-to-day. 

ETA: Some people in the comments seem to think I treat my boyfriend like an unpaid taxi service, so I want to clarify that is definitely not the case. I have my own car, but these arguments occur when my car is in the shop or when he insists on coming to pick me up himself. He is always the one that insists on hanging out when I don't have my own transportation. I tell him that he'll have to take me home too, and he always agrees, so I feel it is his responsibility to take me home if he's the one who picked me up. 

There have also been several times where he would postpone me leaving his place so I would stay longer, or be forced to spend the night if it had gotten too late. I always have to badger him to leave on time, even when I have my car. ",TwoXChromosomes

I work in a software company. There's two senior engineers in my team - me and a male colleague. Guy is smart, doesn't seem sexist as far as I can tell.

The problem is other people. Whenever someone needs help or has a question they'll ping him personally. CTO has a favor, he'll write to him personally. Someone from another team has a question, they'll ask him personally. Women in our team need help, they'll go to him personally. Etc. Not guys in the team, oddly enough, they always ask us both. 

I barely get personal messages and usually find out about the question after it's solved. But I've received only good feedback about technical knowledge, ideas, trustworthiness and even explaining things to non-technical people.

Today made me extra frustrated. I had responded to a thread in a public channel previously. However, instead of continuing a conversation with me, other people explicitly got my colleague involved. They spoke with him personally afterwards and then tagged him in the thread.

This made me so upset. I feel so undervalued in my work. I developed most of our project, I was the first to join. I have more experience. I know this shouldn't matter, but since I keep getting left out of loop, I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. It's so demotivating.

I'm gonna talk with my manager tomorrow. Gonna ask him what the hell. Not sure how can I attribute this to anything else other than sexism to those other people. My colleague is at fault too for going with this, since our team explicitly agreed to not answer personal requests unless they come from official communication channels.

Does anyone have any tips on how to approach this? Or some outside perspective? I find it a bit hard to stand up for myself without getting really upset. I'm not even sure how do I start with this and not appear dramatic.

I was not in a relationship with these people.

1708604607.0,To testify or not?,"TLDR: I've been invited to testify at the state level about my experience with domestic abuse and gun violence. My divorce is still ongoing, though mediated settlement agreement has already been signed and notarized by both parties. Divorce hearing still pending. Concerned about me testifying potentially backfiring somehow. Seeking advice. 

Five months ago, I left my abusive husband, after nine years of marriage. Thankfully, we didn't have kids. He was physically, verbally, emotionally, and psychologically abusive, and also had a laundry list of other issues: anger, excessive drinking for a number of years, hoarding, chronic unemployment, and financial irresponsibility. 

Since leaving him, I've been doing all the things to heal: therapy on a weekly basis, making healthier food choices, ensuring I get a bit of exercise each day, getting adequate sleep, etc. Objectively speaking, life has also gotten far better since leaving him: I sold the house he and I lived in and earned a modest profit, found myself a lovely condo in the city, took two fabulous and restorative vacations, earned a sizable raise and bonus at work, etc. I'm also being very intentional about spending quality time with friends, re-embracing the art of investing in my own self-care and personal fulfillment, and cultivating community, especially since my own family lives halfway around the world, so finding a new 'tribe' for myself has felt deeply important to me.

Leaving my abusive marriage has also caused me to experience a 'crisis of faith', so to speak -- but in a good way. It has made me want to connect far more with my Judaism, on a deeper level than I was ever exposed to during my upbringing. So, I've been attending temple on a weekly basis since the new year began, and have also been involved with other related events through my synagogue. 

An opportunity has presented itself for me to testify (at the state level) about my own experience with domestic violence & gun violence. I've been invited to testify in the (state) senate on behalf of a bill that would aim to help protect victims of domestic violence if/when their abuser fails a background check when attempting to apply for/purchase a personal gun. Since I've been personally impacted by both of these issues, the topic is obviously near and dear to my heart. 

However. My divorce isn't final yet. The mediation agreement has been signed and notarized by both him and I, but we haven't had a hearing yet. I already spoke up (somewhat anonymously) about my experience with DV about three months ago, and my soon-to-be-ex-husband found out, and verbally threatened me over it. Nowhere had I used his name, nor slanderous or defamatory language. It was a super vague, non-specific post about domestic violence awareness, and how it doesn't discriminate against anyone, i.e. how DV can impact anyone, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, nationality, religious affiliation, socioeconomic status, etc. His verbal threat claimed that a post like that could be a ""career-killer"" for someone. 

First of all, what career? The man remained intentionally and chronically unemployed for years at a time, and when he did work, he barely earned above minimum wage, despite our VERY hefty mortgage and other bills. He seemed more than happy to let me shoulder the entire burden of adulting, from bringing home all the big bucks to keep up with our nice lifestyle, to still forcing me to continue handling the vast majority of household responsibilities, to the mental load, and more. I basically did ALL OF THE THINGS for close to a decade, while also still simultaneously dealing with chemotherapy, monthly immunotherapy infusions, and surgery after surgery for my autoimmune condition. Second of all, even if he WAS some professional hot-shot, he still wouldn't deserve my silence. If he wanted me to speak more kindly about/of him, then he should've been a better husband. 

Lastly, and sadly, like so many boys/men the past handful of years, he went down a political rabbit hole. Constantly plugged into his headphones listening to right-wing podcast bros, he started getting slowly involved in (Republican) politics at the local level over the past eighteen months or so, etc. He has several friends that work at the state level, specifically in the House and Senate buildings where I would be testifying next week. Needless to say, I am concerned about my testimony potentially getting back to him through the grapevine, and potentially backfiring on me during the remainder of my divorce proceedings. 

Has anyone testified about their experience before, in either the same or a similar capacity? What was your experience like? The logical side of me says ""shut up"" until the divorce is truly final. Every other part of me -- morally, ethically, spiritually, and most of all the feminist in me -- asks: why the flying fuck does he deserve my silence? I shouldn't have to feel compelled to stay quiet about the damage he inflicted upon me. The experience of what *he* did to *me* also happened to me. It's not just his story. It's my story too. It feels almost serendipitous or uncanny that an opportunity like this has presented itself. What if an opportunity like this doesn't come along again? I'd love any feedback from the community.

1708600972.0,Am I an a-hole if I never engage with a friend who values me for reasons I will state below,"This person was my friend and the main person I hung out with in 11th grade and we remained friends ‚Äì but no longer as close ‚Äì for 3 years after that

When we no longer studied at the same school, however, we grew apart even more.

At some point, I realized I didn't want to be her friend anymore because whenever we did engage I was always the one to keep the conversational ball rolling. I would always show my enthusiasm and be humorous. 

This used to NOT bother me back then because her quietness used to feel like receptivity, and as an incredibly introverted type of person, this made me feel like she was holding space for me to express myself. We were friends because of a shared interest in art. 

Over time, I realized that if I wasn't keeping the ball rolling, the interaction would just feel dead. Humor is not her strong suit, and she isn't conversationally sharp, which unnerves me sometimes because it always feels like the energy is about to collapse into the awkwardness of pure silence. 

Why do I feel bad? Because she considers me as one of the best people she's ever met. That's why. 

In recent years, she's always been the one to initiate a rare conversation with me online, and every time, I show genuine enthusiasm and try to be stimulating in my responses, but she is just so monotonous. 

The fact that she initiates shows that she STILL cares... but holy hell, why can't she at least try to be interesting. This is why I feel guilty. 

I am also annoyed at her because in my head it's like, ""Okay, you reached out... and expect me to do the rest, right?""

I never initiate because this is what I expect. But whenever SHE initiates, I scrap all that and always assume she'd be different this time, so I engage enthusiastically.

But it's always the same thing. In the last two times she messaged me, she left me on seen. I assume this is because she doesn't know what to respond. 

It's so confusing to me because she's signalling that she still wants to be my friend but the effort to show her enthusiasm is not there (unless it involves tagging me or being responsive but in a naturally curt way). 

I realize this is just her personality. I'm sure she is genuinely appreciative of me, but her absolute lack of energy is difficult for me to engage with. Her responses are always SHORT and I find it infuriating, and yet I know she can't help it. 

I have another friend (let's call her B) who is also incredibly introverted like her, but B is always very open, engaging, and even though she is not usually one to crack jokes, she actually REACTS. I also do not mind not talking to B for long stretches of time because whenever we meet up, it feels like we are mutually engaged and so it feels fulfilling. 

I am annoyed because I feel like I'm being unwittingly guilt-tripped (even though this isn't actually the case). Imagine someone directly telling you how much you mean to them but not giving you any incentive to want to be around them.

I wasn‚Äôt sedentary at all and eating too much. I didn‚Äôt eat as much as my boyfriend mind you, he‚Äôs shorter than me as well I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 he is 5‚Äô7. 

Just doing my usual stuff.
Now I quit the mini pill three weeks ago, woke up today with insane cramps and heavy bleeding and am regretting getting off of it, but I also don‚Äôt want low libido and weight gain!

So‚Ä¶can anyone explain this? Because I am so confused and I love not having any periods but I couldn‚Äôt take the weight gain.

1708549927.0,Female Gamer Woes,"This is just a vent.

A few months back, while browsing the PS store, Stellar Blade popped up. I gave the trailer a watch and added it to my wishlist. Looks fun. As more news came out, a subreddit popped up and I eagerly trotted over to see what the news was.

Oh, never mind. It's just post after post about what the character and body model look like. Look at the outfit, look at her butt, look at her boobs and butt, look at her body model, look at her body model's boobs and butt. Best game ever for boobs and butt /s

Now, I'm not upset that the character is attractive or that people find her and her character model attractive. I'm just irritated because that's all people seem to talk about now. I don't see that kind of behavior with, like, RDR2 or COD. Same thing happened with Nier Automata. I *love* that game. But it's so hard to find anything that isn't related to 2B's butt. I had to actually order a custom print because so many were her half naked. The game brings up philosophical questions, with almost every major boss is named after a philosopher. People rarely talk about that, because butt. The game play is amazing. But butt. The music is great. But have you seen her butt?

I saw post after post priaisng the RE4 remake. No post about how great the game is for Leon booty. Discussions about the game play, removal of quick time events, you know, discussions? (don't worry though. Plenty of posts about Ada not being sexy enough though. And why can't we see Ashley's ears! And where is her boob joke! The SJW are ruining my games! /s)

I don't know where I'm even going with this. I'm just disappointed I guess. I know the game isn't out yet, so we mostly have visuals to go off of, but it feels icky. Like a way of saying ""this game isn't for you."" I suppose I may just be selfish, maybe even jealous because I don't look like those characters so I'm just lashing out.

1708558593.0,UTI or?,"It‚Äôs been nearly a month of experiencing UTI symptoms. The first week I struggled with urination, pelvic/back pain, slight burning sensation, the second week (That‚Äôs when I went on antibiotics) I had already developed a fever, accompanied with headaches, but my pelvic pain had reduced. Now during the third week, my doctor suggested changing to stronger antibiotics, which genuinely made no difference, but my fever had reduced and wouldn‚Äôt increase much further, no burning sensation while urinating, but what I had noticed was a strong ammonia smell while urinating, especially in the mornings. And on the 4th week we decided to continue the treatment with the same antibiotics for 5 more days in order to fully clear the infection. Now, 2 more days left of antibiotics, I‚Äôve again, developed the burning sensation, the smell of ammonia is rather strong, I‚Äôm also currently fighting the flu and I feel dreadful.  

THINGS TO NOTE:

Since the onset of my symptoms I haven‚Äôt had any discharge. 

Back pain had reduced during the 3rd week of using new antibiotic medication. (Doctor however thinks the back pain is unrelated as the pain area was lower than the kidneys.) 

We made sure to do urgent blood tests for CRP, which showed an elevated leukocyte level. On my last check up, a couple of days ago, there was a decrease in leukocytes. 

My doctor also sees no need for a urine culture test as she‚Äôs confident that an infection properly shows up during a simple dipstick urine test. (In which case I don‚Äôt believe it to be true. The only time it showed some abnormalities for me was during my period. To be precise for leukocytes +1, for rbc  +3. And from what I gather, these abnormalities don‚Äôt necessarily happen to point to an active infection.) 


I don‚Äôt know what to do. Genuinely feel like going to a private clinic and insisting on a urine culture test at this point. I‚Äôm also having second thoughts about this being a UTI. Perhaps it‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs BV?

1708566721.0,How can I (27 F) cope with the resentment of my long distance boyfriend (29 M) being unemployed for over a year?,"Hi! My boyfriend (29M) and I (27F) met about a year ago. When we met, we both had just been laid off from our jobs. We met through mutual friends when he was visiting California to visit his friends. We ended up hitting it off and FaceTiming for a month before he visited me from the East Coast. Because we had both been laid off, we had so much time to get to know each other and quickly became inseparable. 

About 3 months after I had been laid off, I was able to find another job and have been working since then. My boyfriend hasn‚Äôt found a job yet and it‚Äôs been a little over a year since he got laid off. He lives at home with his family, so he hasn‚Äôt had to worry about bills, and for the first few months of us dating he said he was trying to branch into UX design by taking online courses. His dedication to the courses wavered and he hadn‚Äôt been making any progress on a career switch or finding a job in his field. Last summer we had to have a talk about his job search, as I was feeling frustrated about his lack of zeal. I have been independent since graduating college when I was 21, and my boyfriend has lived at his family home since graduating to save money. That‚Äôs totally fine, and I wish I could be in the same boat as him with such a great relationship with my family, but I feel like my perspective is so much different. I need to work, as I don‚Äôt have family to fall back on, and he‚Äôs always had a lower pressure situation, which is why he hasn‚Äôt had much zest in getting another job. 

We have talked about him relocating to my city since he has a lot of friends and community over here already, hopefully by the end of the year. This all depends on him finding a job though. He‚Äôs been applying to so many jobs, researching a UX boot camp, and has started applying to things that are out of his field. I know he‚Äôs trying his very best and that the job market is tough right now, but I‚Äôm still feeling frustrated. I know he has a lot of pressure on him to find a job so that this relationship can work. Until he finds one, we‚Äôre stuck traveling across the country to see each other with no end in sight to the long distance. I feel like I need to bare a larger financial burden (flying to see him more), and I‚Äôve even considered getting my own apartment and not having a roomate so we can spend more time together without inconveniencing anyone. I feel exhausted from having to sustain this cross country relationship and feel resentful that he‚Äôs the one who is keeping us from really building a future together. I feel like I have no control over our situation. I want to be supportive and patient, but I‚Äôm starting to doubt his ability to be find work and it scares and frustrates me. I want to make this relationship work. My boyfriend is such a kind, caring, and loving person who is trying his best. 

Are my feelings valid? Am I being unreasonably frustrated? Any advice would be appreciated. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm struggling with my long distance relationship where my boyfriend has been unemployed for a year.

However, we do have a bit of a language barrier. We do not share the same first language and neither of us are fluent in the other's language. This can obviously lead to some miscommunications, some of which happen during sex. 

A few years ago, at the start of another relationship, I was drugged and raped. I woke up while he was in the act. I was hallucinating from the drugs and thought animals were surrounding my head. I started panicking and he pushed and held me back down, I was drifting in and out of consiousness the whole time and there was nothing I could do to stop him.

During a couple miscommunications in my new relationship, I have started to panic when he can't understand my directions or I can't understand his during sex. Full on panic attacks relating directly to the incident from the past. I made him aware of the trauma, but not until after this happened. We have since established what we are or are not comfortable with. But I am so scared to have a reaction like this again, or that it will impact my trust in other ways.

I've been on my period for nearly three years straight and have grown increasingly worried about what could be causing it. I first told my mom when I was 15 and she was supportive, but after an ultrasound, my gynecologist(who I never knew before this) was convinced it was a hormonal issue(she never did tests on my hormone levels). 

After going on birth control that only made it worse I ended up sobbing to her that something was wrong and she wasn't listening. I don't think it's hormonal, I have a few other issues ""down there"" that I feel like could be pointing to something else. Idk what, but something. I wanted to get a PAP just to feel like I'd been actually looked at, but was refused. 

My mom blew up at me before my last appointment and told me it was pointless, it was just my period evening out, even though I've had my period since I was 9 and it was fairly consistent before this. She didn't even say anything when I started crying, so I just dropped it and haven't pushed the matter since. 

But I'm constantly anxious about what's wrong with me. I was only able to convince her to buy me pairs of period underwear within the last year, and it's so constant that it's all I wear. Not to be TMI but I'm almost 18 now and it's really impacted my sexual health too, I'm bleeding quite literally every day. 

It's been so long that I don't think it's cancer or anything, but I'm at a loss of what to do. Should I wait till I'm 18 and push harder for a PAP(doctor said no because I'm a minor), even though that's months away? Should I push now and just deal with my mom getting angry with me? Or is this actually fine?

* Not looking for medical advice, I'm just really unsure. I never do anything penetrative so before you ask it's not me being ""rough"".

1708572223.0,Unsure whether to go through with abortion.,"I (24f) found out this week that I am unexpectedly pregnant.

This is not the first time this has happened to me with my current partner (24m). A little less than two years ago, I found out I was pregnant. However, at the time, I was in grad school while working an unpaid internship and other part time jobs, and my partner was figuring out what training program he wanted to enter into, and we weren't living together - having a baby at that point in time seemed like a financial and logistical impossibility. So, deciding to have an abortion was a relatively easy decision to make.

When I told my partner about this pregnancy, he assumed that we would have another abortion. To be fair, I have said that I didn't think I wanted kids for at least another four years.

In my mind, though, things are different now from the first one. I have a well-paying job, and am moving to a different position with a 40% raise. My partner has a job he loves, and is also getting promoted. We live together in a great apartment where rent isn't crazy, and live near both of our families, whom we see regularly and are a great support system. I am, more and more, entertaining the thought of keeping this baby, to the point where I drew out an imaginary budget for us with a newborn next year - and found that it was doable. I love kids, and think I am ready to be a parent.

The only thing is, I'm pretty sure my partner is not ready for children. I don't think I want to break up with him over this, and I don't know that I would be able to nor would I want to have the baby on my own without him. Getting the abortion seems like the logical option, but I know it is going to take a significant emotional toll, and I might deeply regret it.

A saliva test that screens for breast cancer is showing promising results in experimental testing, according to a new study.

The hand-held device detects breast cancer [biomarkers](https://www.futurity.org/breast-cancer-imaging-35-biomarkers-2265502-2/) from a tiny sample of spit, say researchers from the University of Florida and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan.

‚ÄúImagine medical staff conducting breast cancer screening in communities or hospitals,‚Äù says Hsiao-Hsuan Wan, a doctoral student in the chemical engineering department at the University of Florida and lead author of the study published in the [*Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology B*](https://doi.org/10.1116/6.0003370).

‚ÄúOur device is an excellent choice because it is portable‚Äîabout the size of your hand‚Äîand reusable. The testing time is under five seconds per sample, which makes it highly efficient.‚Äù

The new tool works by placing a [saliva sample](https://www.futurity.org/covid-19-saliva-test-nasal-swab-2502732-2/) on a test strip, which is treated with specific antibodies that respond to cancer biomarkers.

Electrical impulses are sent to contact points on the biosensor device. Signals are measured and translated into digital information about how much biomarker is present. The results are quick and easy to interpret, Wan says.

During testing, the device distinguished between healthy breast tissue, early breast cancer, and advanced breast cancer in a small group of 21 women. Their biosensor design uses common components like glucose testing strips and the open-source hardware-software platform Arduino.

1708561677.0,I am done with hook ups,"I read a post in reddit written by a man that garnered hundred likes saying they would hook up with any woman that has a hole regardless if they find them attractive. It's just a secret hookup anyway so looks don't matter and it's not like they're going to be their girlfriends. He also mentioned girls shouldn't feel too happy or be confident after hooking up with a beautiful man or someone very attractive because that person reduced them to be nothing but a hole. 

I mean I already know that the concept of hookups is specifically objective is just to have sex. It's just weird to me how this guy put up this description. I just somehow thought, everyone have sex with someone they find attractive. However, it definitely is the hard truth. I am no longer hooking up. I find that I dont really get any benefits from it as not all of them can make me enjoy it and most times, it was dangerous to me. I also didnt like the idea of being just a random hole to any guy. It was just an eye opener to me. I also somehow get a lot of judgment that I went through with it. 


Any women who thought the same after experiencing hookups?

You are always free to disagree if the hookup experience was in no way harmful or disappointing to you. That makes me really happy to hear that it isnt a bad experience. I will change the question.

1708558047.0,The audacity of some people,"I just remembered an incident that happened years ago that still makes my blood boil. 

It was peak morning time at a fast food chain and I just finished ordering a breakfast meal at the front of the queue. Then suddenly this man came right up to my face and demanded rudely ‚Äògive me ¬£5‚Äô. I was so pissed off because 1) the whole room was packed with singular men and people in family groups, he didn‚Äôt ask anyone else who was being served. 2) I‚Äôm an east Asian woman (we know some of the stereotypes that come with this) and I might look ‚Äòdainty‚Äô, ‚Äòmeek‚Äô and ‚Äònerdy‚Äô and this man was thrice my size 3) it was like 7am and I was hangry 4) he was so FUCKING rude!!! Anyway I paid in cash but didn‚Äôt think he saw me, so I politely said ‚Äòsorry I don‚Äôt have any cash‚Äô to avoid confrontation. This fucker called me out and said ‚ÄòI saw you pay in cash, so give it to me‚Äô. I looked at this fucker dead in the eyes and said ‚Äòwhy are you entitled to anything I have?‚Äô, I know I gagged him because he didn‚Äôt respond and left without getting violent (thankfully). The room was busy but it was quite quiet so I definitely know other people heard. Not one person checked if I was okay or even seemed to care to interject and help me, but I think I held my own at that moment in time anyway. What really takes the fucking piss is when I was eating he ran up to me and tried to grab my paper bag that was keeping my hash brown and ran. Good thing I have quick reflexes, because I snatched that shit back quick and shouted at him to fuck off! We all know the hash brown is the best bit and you should always save the best for last.

Where the fuck do people like this get the AUDACITY to be like this? They see someone they think are weaker and try to bully them into submission. FUCK THEM.

1708553608.0,The Day I Became a Back Rest,"This is an event that happened a few years ago.

My husband and I traveled to Illinois to attend our son's graduation from Navy Basic Training. The room where the ceremony was held was like an enormous gymnasium,  with traditional bleacher-style seats. We were running a bit late so we had to sit where we could find space.

As we sat down, I took a brief look at those around me. It was the man sitting sitting directly in front of me that caused me a bit of worry. Just the way he spoke to his wife, gave concern that he had zero respect for women.  In a couple minutes, I had proof he didn't.  He gradually leaned back until he was firmly pressed against my knees. I was now his backrest.

We know the game.  If I spoke up, he'd blame me for taking up so much room, bullying me into making myself as small as possible so he'd have extra room.  I checked. Not only was I properly in my own space, I also had no need to lean on the person behind me.
At this point, he was starting to push himself hard into my knees.  He was no longer speaking to his group, instead, he was fully vested into our interaction. 

How many times are we placed in a situation that we could be the target of a aggressive confrontation,  with someone who is encouraging it?  I have anxiety and I didn't want to ruin the experience because of this bully.  Enter our friend, creative non-compliance.

The Navy Band began to play.  Suddenly I became appreciative of marching music.  I began to tap my foot.  He pressed in harder. Suddenly, I started to basically invent ""sitting step-dancing: little kicks, shimmies, jumps. As the music played, I lost all inhibitions and simply let my legs do the talking.  Within a few minutes, he sat straight up and got off my legs, without any word spoken.

While I'm amused AF about this, it doesn't escape me that this man would have never have done this to another man!  He was either going to invade my space or bully into giving it. Why do we need to have an entire ""bag o' tricks"" to protect ourselves in a non-confrontational way?

1708553008.0,Am I condemned to dissatisfaction with sex? ,"Hi everyone. I desperately need advice and help with my situation because it's bothering me a lot. 

I (23F) have been in a stable relationship with my classmate (23M) in college for a year now. He's a terrific boyfriend and honestly all I could ever wish for. 

We live in a country where relationships and sex outside of marriage are frowned upon. Also we both live on campus and are financially dependent on our parents who don't know about our relationship (it's extremely common here). We can't live together till a year later (when we'll both start working) and can't afford to rent rooms regularly. 

When our relationship began, I was excited to have sex but he wanted to wait till marriage. I agreed, because sex before marriage is not that common here anyway, and i felt (and still do) that it wasn't worth abandoning our relationship for sex. 

But within a few months, he became more progressive and comfortable with the idea of having sex. We were then faced with the problem of not having a place to do it at. When we get the rare opportunity to be alone, there's no bed for me to lie on or get comfortable for him to attempt giving me an orgasm. So we just do some foreplay and I give him a blowjob. I got dissatisfied with not having an orgasm after a few times of doing this, because I'm used to masturbating and almost always orgasm when I do it myself. I told him about this, and he saved up some money and rented us a room. We spent a whole day there and I thought I'd finally be able to climax because we had enough space and time. He tried really hard and gave me oral for a long time but I couldn't orgasm at all. I told him that it was okay and I was fine, but he told me that he had barely tried for 10 minutes, he really wanted to help me climax and asked me not to feel guilty about taking more time. But nothing worked, and eventually we both gave up. 

After this incident, I find myself avoiding intimate time with him because I feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. Even if I feel good during foreplay, I always feel frustrated at the end because there's no orgasm for me, while he always gets to finish, fast and easy. Earlier there used to be hope- that if we had the right circumstances, I'd be able to finish too. We've only attempted it once, so I may be overreacting, but these intrusive thoughts are really bothering me. He still wants occasional blowjobs, but whenever I do it, I feel sad all over again. And I also simultaneously feel selfish, because it's totally not his fault that he can't attempt to help me climax- we really cannot afford to rent a room now, so maybe I should stop thinking about myself and continue giving him blowjobs as frequently as he wants. Why deny him an orgasm just because I can't have one? I know some women say they're fine with never orgasming during sex, but I don't think I'll ever be. I want to stop focussing on orgasms, but it's really hard to see the point of sex without one. Also I feel like I'm incapable of orgasming with a partner and that I'll never be able to do it no matter how many times we try. Am I overreacting? Am I doomed to dissatisfaction forever?

1708546055.0,Workman appeared unannounced on my balcony and found it amusing that I was startled,"The flat next door is having work done, and workmen being about on the balcony adjoining mine has reminded me of an incident a couple years back. Now I've been reminded of it, it's niggling at me (as these incidents tend to do).

I live in an upper-storey flat with the main living space leading out to a secluded balcony through full-length glass doors. At the time of this incident, building management had commissioned workmen to go across the block, flat by flat, erecting scaffolding to do some kind of minor repairs to the balcony brickwork. The scaffolding had gone up on my neighbours', so we would be next.

I was wandering through the living area one morning when I see a dark silhouette in the balcony doors and hear a tapping on the glass. 

Obviously, I completely freak out for a second. For context, I have in the past unfortunately had a man attempt to force entry to my home to get access to me. As anyone who's experienced something like that knows, the unconscious panic reflex in any remotely similar scenario runs very deep. Even without that background, I'm pretty sure most women do not want to see a strange man looming at the door of what they thought was a no-access, private area of their home, looking directly into a space that is not visible from the exterior. I could have been in my pants, or naked.

I then realise it's one of the workmen. Rather than taking an extra minute or two to walk around to my front door, he's directly hopped down onto my balcony off the scaffolding next door.

I open the door, he chuckles - I (stupidly) assume he's about to apologise - and then says:

""I wish I normally such a big effect on women.""

I was so stunned by this I just gawped at him in silence and he just went on to explain whatever it was about setting up his scaffolding the next day. I SO wish I'd got it together in the moment to ask him what the fuck. And did he have to study to become such a cretin or does it just come naturally.

Anyway, not a big or life-changing event anywhere near the scale of some of the experiences shared on this sub. But the lack of not even empathy, but simple imagination - imagination to consider how small, thoughtless behaviours might be experienced by others, for whom the world is a slightly different place - really got under my skin. This is what so much of what everyday sexism is: your (gendered) freedom to move through the world in the most braindead, unreflective way, at the cost of *my* dignity and sense of security (if not actual security).

1708544111.0,I wanted to share my story so I can let go of the empty feeling and the pain I have,"Hello! How are you? I‚Äôm writing here because honestly I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I feel like writing my story will help me feel a little bit better, and maybe you can give me words of advice or encouragement. 

My mother was always abusive. When I was little she once hit me hard in the face because she didn‚Äôt like something I said. She has this habit of belittling you and humiliating you, but she doesn‚Äôt know she does it. She thinks she‚Äôs right and that you should just suck it up. She always tells me she loves me and wants the best for me, but she isn‚Äôt helpful. Once, she threatened to kill herself if I didn‚Äôt call my dad (they were broken up at the time). She would lock herself up in the bathroom to pretend she was overdosing on pills, and me and my sister were desperate, calling 911. My mom had various episodes like that, throwing tantrums on the street to prevent my dad from leaving her and it was threatening to her life. To be honest, it was quite scary. Very scary. The kind of thing that traumatizes you. 

My dad was an enabler. All his life. He never protected me from my mother‚Äôs verbal abuse. He was a victim of it himself. Now all he does is eat candy pills all the time, it‚Äôs like a new addiction he has. 

When I was little and in school, my friends weren‚Äôt nice to me. I had a best friend that once admitted to me that she was jealous of me, and my family. And my house. And then she cut her wrists to show me she cared. I had to stay away. Also the other classmates would bully me, calling me immature. I never did anything wrong. I was always cool with people and nice. But I think people take advantage of that. I suffered from bullying and when I changed school, my classmates posted my phone number on a ‚Äúdating‚Äù website on my town. They posted my phone number and also that I offered ‚Äúservices‚Äù (like saying I was a prostitute). I had an appendectomy before changing school and nobody came to visit me. I was 13 at the time I think. 

I changed school and I made new friends there. But sadly my new best friend disappointed me. I discovered on her Twitter account that she basically hated me. She knows my house of course because she visited me, she was my best friend, so I found the tweets I found repulsive. She would post that she thinks people with a pool in their house think they‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter than everybody else‚Äù. And also, if you have an air conditioner in your house of course you‚Äôre going to like summertime, because you have the air conditioner to provide a cold temperature and that you think you‚Äôre better than people. I‚Äôm not from the US but I‚Äôd love to be, and she knew my fanatism on USA. She posted that people that want to move there are idiots. She was jealous of me.

When I went to Uni, my (only) sister moved away to another continent. She moved a few years ago, and I miss her every day. I felt like a part of me was gone. I would always meet with her friends when there were parties, but when she was gone I never saw them again. She was the glue that kept me and her friends together and hanging out. The bad part about the fact that she left is that my mom was abusive towards her. She once told my sister that it would be a disgrace if she had children there. And anytime my sister would come to visit us, my mom would start screaming that she misses her, but she would get violent and abusive. She never hit her, but she was violent in the way she yelled and spoke. My dad would join her and not defend my sister, but defend my mom. Once, my dad ended up in the hospital due to blood pressure and my mom ended up falling to the floor, to add some drama. She is mentally ill. My sister once told me she is afraid of being a mom because she doesn‚Äôt wanna be like our mom. 

Two years after she(my sister) moved, my uncles and cousins moved to another continent, too. It was very hard for me because I had such a strong connection to my little cousins I loved them so much and they loved me too. I felt like another part of me was gone. They sold their house, of a lifetime, to move away. 

A year after, during covid, I lost my grandpa. And then the next year, I lost another one to cancer. Back in 2018 when there was no pandemic I also lost my grandma, it was like the starting point to all the losses. I only have one grandma left out of everyone. I‚Äôm 25 years old. 

And when I lost the one to cancer, that was also the same time my ex left me. It was very hard dealing with two losses at the same time. 

My ex was going away to another continent for an exchange program. See? Everyone was moving away. He was going to leave for six months and I couldn‚Äôt stand another loss. I left crying from his farewell party and I got drunk because I had seen my grandpa being taken away and consumed by cancer just 7 days prior to that farewell party and my ex leaving. Also my ex didn‚Äôt talk to me during the party, he was talking to his friends and I told him that. He understood but then when I told him that my parents grounded me for being drunk, he hated me and told me I was a little kid. He wanted me to go have dinner to his house 3 days before he would leave, and I couldn‚Äôt go. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to. 

He told me my parents didn‚Äôt actually care about me and that if I didn‚Äôt escape my house and defy them, then that meant I never really loved him or care about him. 

So then he asked for a break. During his time away, he posted photos being affectionate with other women, and I had to see it. This wasn‚Äôt the first time he was mean to me, I remember once he wanted me to send him nude photos. Or hot photos. When I said no, he said that it meant going backwards in our relationship, or taking it one step back, because we did have sex, and sending photos means much less than having sex.  He was manipulating me. 

I remember the first times we started dating and texting, he would reply maybe a day later and I remember I had to remind him of our dates, because he is just so ‚Äúhands off‚Äù when it comes to communicating. 

I was the one asking him (specifically twice) ‚Äúwhat are we?‚Äù And he would be like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in labels‚Äù. But when I told him I did believe in labels, he compromised and we were boyfriend and girlfriend but it lasted one month because then he left and asked for the break. He mentioned the break before, stating that his brother always takes breaks with his girlfriend when he goes away on trips. And that when he comes back, they see where they‚Äôre at and maybe they get back together. 

I remember the moment I found out about his trip.  We were going to the same singing teacher, and when I came to my class the teacher said to me ‚Äúdid he tell you about his trip?‚Äù. Turns out he had told our teacher before me. There are a lot of things like this that I won‚Äôt mention here because the post would get infinitely long. Disrespects, shady attitudes, and not to mention his activities with drugs. 

After him talking shit about my family and dumping me because my problems were way too big for him, I wanted to die. I was vulnerable to the wrong person. I had told him that my mom yes she maybe mistreats me. And that my parents were very mean to me at that time and that I wanted to leave. I remember sending him voice messages crying and being like, of course I want to see you, I‚Äôm grounded, I can‚Äôt, don‚Äôt be mad at me, don‚Äôt think that I don‚Äôt love you, but he still insisted that I didn‚Äôt care and that he was going to dump me. His best friend unfollowed me on social media, and he talked about my family to his family. He didn‚Äôt want to reveal what his family thought or said about mine, so I felt humiliated to the core. 

As I‚Äôm writing this, I can see how strong I am to face my reality and to put it into words, and to share it with you. If you have read this far, I wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart. Even though I can share my story, it doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt heavy. I try every day to wake up with hopes. I am happy. I recognize that while dating my ex I felt anxious, I had social anxiety and maybe he could see that. But I can‚Äôt feel ashamed of that. It‚Äôs part of my growth. Now thank god I‚Äôm better and I don‚Äôt have the symptoms I used to have. 

I guess I held onto my ex because I feel alone. I suffered from way too many losses and I also wanted to have a partner to be with me. Because I can‚Äôt comprehend why I would want to be with someone that has a ‚Äúhands off‚Äù approach and style of communication. Why? Why settle for someone that wasn‚Äôt sure about what he wanted? He even once told me he felt like he wanted to slap me in the face while we were having sex. 

Right now I‚Äôm trying to put the pieces of my self esteem back together. It‚Äôs a struggle. Some days I even think that it would be amazing and pain free not to be alive. Sometimes I think about my ex being happy with some other girl.

I should also add that my family doesn‚Äôt talk to me. My cousins are too bothered making money, and some of them are jealous of me. They don‚Äôt send a message to see how I‚Äôm doing or anything. I only see them at birthdays and holidays, or when my sister comes to visit. That‚Äôs when I see them. Otherwise, they don‚Äôt even bother to send anything. (Including uncles and aunts). They don‚Äôt come to visit me. ",TwoXChromosomes

(In so many words you‚Äôre not actually in pain, it‚Äôs you imagining it) 

-So dehumanizing, had no words. I left this doctor numb then broke down crying in the car, and had another appointment scheduled with a GI doctor too right after that. I was desperate for answers, I have been. No matter what, I KNOW I‚ÄôM IN PAIN.

I couldn‚Äôt be happier, to finally be listened to and believed??!?!? My god, it was a HALLELUJAH. I was able to get the CT scan the same day!!! And the results the same day!!! It‚Äôs only today 2/21 where my doctor analyzed the results and sent 4 lengthy paragraphs telling me what they mean. 

Drumroll‚Ä¶.

CT scan results: 

Fatty liver disease, a bladder infection, and  constipation. 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

So most extreme, in the same day I was told in so many words I needed to see a therapist because I was imagining pain that wasn‚Äôt there‚Ä¶ to you have fatty liver disease, a bladder infection, and constipation. I can‚Äôt believe the emotional rollercoaster this has been. I was dismissed by too many doctors until one finally took me serious. I am convinced the GI doctor I met is an angel from above because she was the first one to actually care and wants to figure out what is really going on‚Ä¶ crazy.

You really have to advocate for your own health. I know captain obvious, but at the same time I think I easily could have listened to the first medical professional who told me I was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and kept on with my daily life. However, 3 doctors later pushing for answers come to find out if I would have followed that I‚Äôd be on track to liver failure among other things. Today is a celebration to finally know what‚Äôs going on. I hope that me sharing this may help at least one person out there reading this know that you aren‚Äôt crazy or self-gaslighting. No one knows your body better than you do. Trust yourself. Fight! It may save your life, and the source is me because it just saved mine.

1708536091.0,I can't figure out if I'm overreacting,"I (F24) broke up with my BF (M32) of 2 years last night. Things have been going well but I've been under a lot of stress from various places (work, a parent in hospice, etc ) and I told him that I was afraid of hurting him in my manic state and that I thought we should take a break for me to get my head in order.

He said, accurately, that I was self isolating in my panic and that we needed to work things out. Several times when I tried to leave the conversation out of frustration he would put his hands on my knee or shoulder to keep me from leaving. I put a blanket on and pulled it over my shoulders as it provides me comfort and helped me through the conversation.

At one point I was telling him that I just wasn't in a good place, that I felt like the relationship was going to make it worse, just. I was spiralling and getting fatalistic and I know I was. But he hit a point in his frustration, and he reached over, ripped my blanket down to my waist, and smacked me on the arm and said ""You've already made your choice so what the fuck does it matter?""

I froze, I looked at my arm just sort of. Disbelieving. We took a second to process it, I was already thinking that I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, then the first words out of his mouth were ""I didn't hit you that hard.""

I started tearing up but I didn't speak. ""That wasn't a hit.""

I started sobbing. I was so petrified I didn't know what to say. He said ""I don't hit people when I'm angry.""

It took him a couple minutes to apologize but he did. We talked more and I sent him back home. Now my own brain is telling me I shouldn't have reacted the way I did and it wasn't a big deal but I don't know if that's just me telling myself I deserve it because the break up was my fault or what. He's never been anywhere close to violent before. I don't know why this happened.

1708532605.0,My boyfriend proposed to me last night  ,"I was in shock when he showed me the ring and asked me to marry him. I didn't feel joy or excitement. Just numb.
We have major issues in our relationship involving cheating and trust due to him being a ""sex addict"" and i should have left him a long time ago.

I told him yes only to keep the peace and he gets a phone call from an unknown number and answers it and walks out of the room. I could hear the convo and it was someone looking for someone else like a wrong number situation but I felt suspicious and knew it wasn't just that. He gets off the phone and i asked him about the call and immediately after he gets a text. I asked him if it was from that unknown number and it was. I don't know what possessed him to be honest with me THAT night but he was and i asked what they said and he tells me that they asked if he wanted to ""mess around"". He goes into defense mode and swears he's not been up to anything *recently* and he swears and all this and that so I asked to see his phone. 

He reluctantly hands me his phone and i check his texts but find nothing. I started to go look in his notification history because if he deleted texts they'd still be in the history even if they're deleted in his sms app and he tells me to please stop. He tells me im not going to like what i find and he doesn't want to fight. 

He admits to having phone sex via text messages with an escort(apparently there are men who like to go to STG and find escorts to text and swap pics with-lie to them telling them he's trying to pay for her time and masturbate to the interaction over the phone then ghost them after the men climax and waste their time)and this isn't the first time he's done this (ive caught him several times doing this) so he knows I don't like it and it hurts me when he does and he does it anyway. 

HE KNOWS IT HURTS ME WHEN HE DOES THIS BUT DOES IT ANYWAY

He argues that its like watching porn and it's harmless.
(I don't have an issue with porn and i watch it too when i masturbate alone) 
IT IS NOT THE SAME AS WATCHING PORN!!

Edit: In an attempt to get him to see where im coming from and how i feel

I tried to get him to see my pov by asking if its ok that i do that but with men on tinder instead and he says its not the same because those men aren't escorts.

I asked him if he was fine doing this knowing how much it hurt me and he tells me that me not being able to orgasm hurts him. And that me needing a vibrator to get myself off afterwards hurt him too. We've been together for 9 months maybe 10 and he decides to tell me that now? When I told him at the very beginning of us talking I cannot orgasm with anyone and have not ever been able to. Almost as if it wasn't a problem until he needed it to be to justify his selfish actions. Like I can help that I am nonorgasnic. 

I started to cry then quickly gained my composure and asked him to order me a uber home and he did reluctantly. He didn't try and see it from my pov or realize the issue i had with it. He let me leave and I did, with the ring. 

I was strong till i got home then the sadness fell over me. I blocked him for the thousandth time. God I hope I keep him blocked and don't reach out. He's not going to change and I know it. I am so disgusted and disappointed. On day one of no contact; wish me luck ladies. 


Edit: He's not paying for escorts. He messages them and masturbates to the excitement of it then ghosts them after he orgasms. Its weird but he's not the only guy who does it. 

I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY THIS MAN I SWEAR TO ALL YOU WONDERFUL LADIES I WON'T!

THE ANSWER TO THE WHY DID I STAY WITH HIM SO LONG AND ETC IS SIMPLY THAT I AM SELF LOVE DEFICIENT AND OTHER THAN THE CHEATING AND ESCORT BS HE HAS BEEN A GREAT GUY AND BOTH OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE TRUE AT THE SAME TIME. 

I DO HAVE FAMILY AND SUPPORT AND I HAVE NOT CONTACTED OR BROKE NO CONTACT ALL DAY AND WILL CONTINUE TO STAY STRONG!

1708532318.0,I‚Äôm scared. ,"I‚Äôve been fighting with complications from chlamydia since July. It was a pretty bad infection because I caught it and treated it later than I‚Äôd prefer. (5 months) 

I‚Äôve been testing negative ever since August. But the aftermath has been hell. I was believed to have developed PID because I had so many consistent symptoms so I was put on that treatment. I was handed out about 10-12 antibiotics within this 9 month period to ease my symptoms that seem to come and go. (Urinary difficulties, feeling like a uti but not unless the rare occasion it is one. Vaginal discomfort, GREEN DISCHARGE that pisses me off to the MAX. 

Fast forward to now, mostly I‚Äôm doing fine. Other than urinary difficulties and bladder pain that seems to flare up after ovulation. But this green discharge will NOT go away. There‚Äôs no odor, or anything of the sorts, Usually it‚Äôs not consistent and comes a couple times a month the rest is white and clear. But the past two weeks it‚Äôs been almost non stop. It‚Äôs not dark, it‚Äôs a light green, not clumpy it‚Äôs like normal discharge but green. 

I‚Äôve been in and out of hospitals and clinics for months I even have a gyno who has no idea what to tell me. My main reasoning why I‚Äôm more panicked now is the fact I may be pregnant (I‚Äôm to scared to test but I‚Äôm very late and experiencing things that aren‚Äôt normal for me.)

I‚Äôm afraid whatever is wrong with me will hurt the possible baby. Nobody has answers for me. Usually when my period starts is when the discharge goes away for a couple weeks than makes its return sometime after ovulating. But it hasn‚Äôt started. All I‚Äôve been getting is either white discharge or the light green. Seemingly not many other symptoms, sometimes minor irritation, my right ovary do hurt but that could be accompanied to my missed period. Urethra discomfort sometimes. On and off bladder aching. 

I‚Äôve been tested for everything multiple times including a PCR for mycoplasma and ureaplasma. Which I‚Äôm planning on testing for again to be sure. My family already has a history of fertility problems. I‚Äôm not as worried about me, don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôve been trying to figure out any possible problem for months with no answers but I‚Äôm more scared about the possibility of being pregnant and this mystery affecting my baby.

1708526578.0,My husband dismissed my whole career,"This is a rant and while I am upset with my husband, I do not need advice on divorcing him. He is a fantastic, supportive person and we very rarely differ in our opinions. I am excited to be building a family with him. 

Context: I am an outpatient therapist and my husband currently has a family member suffering from drug withdrawal induced psychosis. I don't deal with this issue every day, but I have significant resources in our area that can help with this issue. 

There's two parts to this but they are related. 

First part is, that my husband does not believe that therapy would work for him. He has a long mental health history, but has developed relatively healthy coping skills, compared to his family member. Both our jobs provide an EAP, which is several sessions of free talk therapy either locally or over BetterHelp. There have been numerous ups and downs over our relationship due to this family member, which has caused my husband significant distress. I have tried to get him to go to therapy before but the only thing he has done was get on meds, which he is not currently on, but they did help him. 

Over the weekend, the family member was not doing well again, and it had really started to take a toll on my husband. I took care of him and provided him space to process if he wanted to. I have not had fantastic interactions with this family member in the past, and as I am currently pregnant, I am acutely aware that I am in more danger than previously. I have also been stressed about the situation and my husband was worried about stressing me out, so I told my husband one morning that I think it would be helpful for him to at least go to one therapy session to process. My husband told me he ""doesn't think it would work and why would talking to someone else who doesn't know the situation help?"" 

That one hurt. But I brushed it off as I had kind of expected that response. 

The second part, is that this family member is currently delusional and suffering from hallucinations after sobering up. The delusions are not something new, but it has been relayed to me that this is the worst it has ever been. The delusions often focus on the nuclear family and myself, with the theme of ""we are out to get them"". Due to the nature of my work and the amount of stress I have been under, I decided to staff the ""case"" with my supervisor. She provided more resources on top of what I already knew of. Since I have not been directly involved by my husband's parents in the situation, I started sending my husband those resources. 

When I got home that night, I asked my husband if he had sent the resources to his family that are taking care of the family member. He did not as he assumed I would send them. While they are my in-laws, I am aware that I was intentionally not made aware of the situation by my husband's family, so it felt inappropriate to send them resources on a situation that I'm probably not supposed to know about. My husband asked me to explain the resources and then proceeded to say ""well those wouldn't be helpful anyways. You don't know the context of this situation and we don't want to break the trust of the family member."" 

That broke me. I understand that it is hard to get someone suffering from psychosis to voluntarily go to treatment. I understand that not every resource will be helpful. I took time out of my busy day to find resources for my family, to help support them, and my husband dismissed all of that. 

I understand the context of the situation perfectly well. I have clients all the time in that context with their family member or sometimes even themselves. 

For my husband to just dismiss my entire career in a couple sentences, has changed my perspective on him completely. How can someone know what I do for a living, and say that none of it relates to him or his family? How can he stand there and say those things when I have helped him with his own mental health issues? 

I recognize why therapists aren't supposed to do therapy with their friends and family. It is just so frustrating to hear those words from someone whom I confide in and open up to. I feel completely invalidated and honestly, useless.

1708509864.0,Whats the best way to structure doing both couples therapy and individual?,"So it is looking like I'm in the market for a therapist or 2... depending on whether an ultimatum convinces my husband to also attend, or not.

I would also like to start seeing a therapist  individually.   Probably ASAP for individually, and maybe within the next 6 months for adding couples therapy, assuming the ultimatum works...

Is it best to find one therapist that does both, and start seeing them individually, and plan to bring my husband to the same therapist for couple's counseling later?  Or should I be finding 2 separate therapists??  If one, any tips on finding a good one that will meet both our needs?

I feel like one therapist for both would be good because then they would already have some understanding of the relationship when we start couple's therapy... but also can see my husband assuming that the therapist is ""on my side"" since I already  have a relationship  with them and have been ""telling them my side for months""...

I also know we will almost certainly need a male therapist in order for things to work best for my husband, as I believe he will be more receptive to ideas coming from a male (part of our problem, obviously).  But I'd probably prefer female for mine?  Although idk, I think I just don't want a crotchety old guy lol... I guess a male therapist closer to our own age would be totally fine by me too.  But then we're opening the door for husband to make assumptions or accusations that the therapist is ""siding with me"" because he wants me.... which I know is ridiculous, but is likely to be his thought pattern in his current mentaal state -- so I feel I should definitely avoid the potential,  in order to maximize our chances of success...

So, what do I do?  Suck it up and go with a crotchety old guy?  Or look for a female therapist for me and have her recommend  a male therapist for future couple's counseling  if I actually convince him to go?  Or is there some other option I'm missing?  What worked (or didn't) for you??

Edited to add:

We have the means to easily separate and live apart - like, already  have an empty small rental unit we have been using as a home office.  So he can EASILY move out while we attempt therapy.  While the idea saddens me, I kind of feel like this would be for the best as it allows me to better enforce my boundaries on when we are ready to try again / move forward.  We can agree to do this and remain legally married and fully invested in making the marriage work. (I don't particularly  have any interest  in jumping right into any kind of real "" separation "", but I do feel the physical space and better / more easily recognizable  hurdle to moving on, I guess(??), would help.. motivate  him to give therapy an honest effort, I guess?

That and, eliminate the potential that otherwise  exists in this situation, that his current transgressions (mostly microagressions of emotional abuse) could grow into more while I'm trying to fix things.... and honestly  just to have immediate  reprieve  from them while he works on himself I guess??

The guy had obviously gotten away by then. He just casually strolled off after assaulting me while I was yelling at him that I was calling the police. He could not have cared less.

Another guy who was parked right behind my car watched the whole thing happen and did NOTHING. He didn't even pull out his phone to catch the guy on camera, didn't speak with the police to corroborate my story, didn't even ask if I was okay. He just sat there, watching me get sexually assaulted, then drove off when his wife and daughters got in his car. I bet if his wife or daughters ever found themselves in the situation he saw me in, he'd be angry if some guy like himself had just watched it all and done nothing like he did. A quote I remember from a long time ago comes to mind, ""there are two types of evil in the world: those who do evil, and those who see evil and don't try to stop it.""

That's when they put the call out for other patrol cars to search for this guy, **over an hour after the assault.** The police said they would check security camera footage, and asked if I would be willing to identify the guy in a lineup and if I wanted to press charges. The security cameras are on the Target building, and the guy had slipped between my car and the car parked next to me; I doubt the cameras caught anything that could help identify the assailant. But I said I would be more than willing to identify him in a lineup, and that I wanted to press charges to the fullest extent of the law.

It's been two days, and I haven't heard anything from the police. The guy just casually strolled away after assaulting me and got away with it. I feel furious, and afraid. Whenever I go out in public now I'm looking over my shoulder every couple of minutes. The mere presence of any man now makes me back into the nearest wall and wait for him to pass while I clutch the knife I now carry in my pocket. I'm terrified of walking through parking lots. When I'm out after dark in public, my hands tremble and my eyes tear up. My body shakes with fear. Every night that I make it home and park my car, I take the key out of the ignition and lock myself in my car and cry silently before wiping away the tears and forcing a smile as I walk in the door. In addition to the knife I now carry at all times, I'm actively searching brick and mortars for mace that can be carried on a keychain. This guy left a welt on my buttcheek that lasted into the following day. I feel scared around all men now. I feel scared to walk in stores, on campus, and especially in parking lots. I don't know how to live in a constant state of fear like this. I don't know how to feel safe or comfortable in my skin anymore, and I don't know how much longer I will have to battle this terror I feel whenever I'm in public.

My question is, if you yourself don't use a period cup, do you have a specific reason? 

To me it seems like the best possible period product. Lasts for years so no single use waste, no smell as the blood doesnt interact with air until you're emptying the cup, no feeling of ""niagara falls"" ... it's just bliss üò≠

1708497900.0,I regularly tell men I gentle parent men - and I got to tell one of our sexist managers the other day,"I work with a lot of men and it's sooooooo draining. My job is hard, yes, but the hardest part about it is that men can't handle their emotions.   


For context, I work in Sales Progression in Real Estate. Once the sales agent (mainly men) sells a property (predominantly to men), the case gets given to me and I liaise with developers, the government, banks, POAs, buyers, sellers, etc.

  
It's a hard role but it pays pretty well and I think maybe this year I might even be able to go out on my own. 

&#x200B;

The men though. 

&#x200B;

They will literally have no clue of the process, ask me the next step, and when I tell them, they will instruct or demand that I do it - as if I wasn't going to. On top of that they all think they're Jordan Belfort with the best sales skills ever, so it's listening to them thinking they're swindling me or convincing me to do something. 

&#x200B;

As much as I give out it's done wonders for my boundary-building skills. I'm much better at calling shit out, telling people no, and managing expectations for things that are about to fall to shit (because the male agent told lies or just straight up didn't know).

&#x200B;

Anyway... As I mentioned, men are so bloody emotional and have serious meltdowns all the time. And somehow think that if they scream at me, it'll make me respect them or fix it or something. Blatant lies, thinly veiled threats, blatant threats and on and on. I know the contracts inside out... you can threaten all you want but it'll not happen. 

&#x200B;

My job then becomes gentle parenting ""I know, it's hard. They did say they would have it ready today but you know sometimes developers are busy and don't get it done on time. We'll go today and ask them when will it be done"".   


It's a pain in the ass really, because it works, but ITS NOT MY JOB TO MANAGE YOUR EMOTIONS.  


So, I've started saying it to people I work with, and clients. Not that I'm parenting them but insinuating that I am. They'll innocently ask about my day and I'll just laugh about the stress and how emotional men make it worse, etc, etc.   


It gives me a small boost but also helps me feel like I'm doing my part for women in some way. 

&#x200B;

But the other day was the crowning glory. A manager, who told a friend of mine she should quit and go find a husband, is bemoaning to me that his team are like children, and it's hard work and blah, blah, blah. I laughed and told him I'd let him in on a little secret - when men get emotional, or unruly, it's best to gently parent them. It works even though they're adults. 

&#x200B;

I think time actually stopped for him. I've never enjoyed something so much... his brain could not compute what I'd just said and for a man who's spent decades talking shit - he had nothing to say. So I sat in the silence and smiled. Eventually, he blinked, and I said ""you should try it some time"". 

&#x200B;

Awesome.

They go swimming and she's in a cheeky bikini, they do outdoor showers (clothed and not weird or anything) and just cook, watch movies and he sleeps on her van floor while she's in the bed.

I'm just BLOWN away at how some women are able to be so comfortable in bikinis around their dads. My dad never did anything perverted or sexual to me at all but my parents both made me feel like my body was not something that was ok to be shown, and I know for sure if I'd ever dared to wear a bikini in front of my dad, or even my brother and mom as a teen or young adult I'd been berated with comments about either fat (I wasn't fat), being slutty ""cover your tits"" sort of comments. I'm just in awe there are familial relationships where a woman's body isn't ridiculed and is ok to be ""on display"" while swimming or on a hot day.

I didn't grow up religious, I'm from a western country with no affiliation to anything regarding cultural norms say women cover up. This is just the oppressive vibe I grew up with and to this day I feel uncomfortable in a tank top.

I've gained a little weight recently and feeling that societal pressure to have my fat in the ""right"" places otherwise I'm less than. Granted there's been a recent movement of self love and inclusivity of all body types but I think we've got a long way to go before the misogynistic mindset has been wiped clean of placing value on women based on their looks. Women celebrities are faced with it in a very public way, young girls and women are influenced by the push of the model body type all over social media of what's considered desirable. We are told if your boobs aren't big enough, butt not big enough, body not fit enough, face not pretty enough, etc, then you're not enough. Fuck that! We are more than our outward appearances. We can offer more than our looks to ourselves, family, friends, and society as a whole.

I'm sure this has been said on this sub before but I just had to say it again. I am so grateful I didn't grow up when social media was so prevalent and pervasive.

I have no desire for kids, and my partner and I are on the same page about that and both happy with me never being able to become pregnant.  Even still, for months, I agonized over whether or not to donate my eggs.

 I would have to delay my transition, wait to get matched with people to receive my eggs, get on ‚Äúfemale‚Äù hormones for several weeks, and have an invasive procedure to remove the swollen eggs.

So there was a comment on another thread that linked to this article, and it really hit home for me. My ex defended his creepy friend and wanted ME to forgive HIM after we let him live with us when he had nowhere else to go, and when he left we found a bunch of my panties in the room he'd stayed in that he'd used to jack off into. He acted like I blew the entire thing out of proportion because I wanted to cut contact with him completely, because I went into a complete panic attack when I found out he was still using our Netflix account, because a (coerced, by my boyfriend) apology wasn't enough for me to just let everything go and pretend nothing happened. But he was abusive in many ways and this was only the first of several times that he chose his friends over me and my well-being, so I thought this was just because he was a shitty guy but like...

This happens to other people? A guy nearly assaults you and your SO defends HIM? This isn't just something my ex did to me because he was a particular brand of asshat?? Why does that make it so much worse?

1708480062.0,Should I be bothered by what a coworker said to me about my hair?,"Hello everybody, this is my first post to this subreddit so I‚Äôll try to keep things short. 

I got a new job in October of last month and things have been pretty good all things considered with how my last job was. I am a manager in training, so I‚Äôm basically second in command under the actual manager. There are four drivers for the company, and me and one other person are the only women (and women of color) there. 

One of the drivers, I‚Äôll call him Greg, is a pretty chill guy for the most part. Quick rundown for Greg and how he is. He started doing certain things that have started to bother me. I‚Äôve noticed he likes to reorganize small stuff in the store, which is fine, it gives him something to do when we aren‚Äôt busy and it makes sense to him when he has to pull them later for a delivery. It starts to become a problem when he is the only person that can understand how he organized something though. There are two other drivers in the morning and they hate putting parts away because Greg doesn‚Äôt explain how he arranged things. He also goes behind my back and rearranges stuff after I‚Äôve taken time (sometimes up to an hour!) to make parts easy to grab and I‚Äôve explained to the other drivers how I organized things. He is also always trying to change how our stock is being shown. There is a comment every single day at least once about how we should change where things should go, or move things to completely different locations. The manager and I have both told him we don‚Äôt want to change the layout of the store, but Greg doesn‚Äôt listen and he‚Äôs back to bringing it up the following day. 

That being said, here‚Äôs what he said about my hair. 

I had my hair in box braids for a while and decided to take them out and leave my hair natural for a while. The only other time my hair had been natural I wore a headscarf so nobody saw it. I did small braids and was kinda feeling ‚Äúiffy‚Äù about it to begin with, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I liked it or not. I tried to get over it, but today at work Greg came in and we said good morning, then we got busy. When work died down, he was sitting at one of the computers and randomly asked me ‚ÄúHey name, did you stick a fork in an electrical socket or something? What‚Äôs up with your hair?‚Äù 

That came out of nowhere. There was no other conversation or anything else. Just that question. My hair is typical black people hair, difficult to manage and there is shrinkage with my braids, and my hair naturally wants to curl at the ends even in braids, so the ends might have looked a little rough I guess. He left a couple of hours later and before he did he looked at me and said ‚ÄúTry not to touch any more electrical outlets okay?‚Äù I asked my manager if my hair looked bad or anything because I consider him a good friend and I feel comfortable talking to him about situations like this. He didn‚Äôt think there was anything wrong with my hair and thought the comment was really random. He didn‚Äôt think Greg meant it to be rude, and I didn‚Äôt either at first, but I‚Äôm very self conscious about my hair. I‚Äôve had a lot of issues surrounding my hair wether it‚Äôs socially or professionally, and have never felt completely comfortable wearing it natural. As far as I know, he‚Äôs never said anything like this to the other woman of color that works with us, granted, she has dreads but that shouldn‚Äôt matter. 

I got so overwhelmed that I went home and cried. Does anybody else have to deal with this? Specifically at work? I‚Äôm not exactly thinking straight, I‚Äôve had a migraine since I got home and it‚Äôs difficult to think. Should what he said bother me? What can I do?

I can see how Joni is kind of an acquired taste, and yet, artists like Prince and Maynard James Keenard and more have listed joni as a major influence of their music. Aka, male artists that are widely respected by men. 

Joni is, kinda, getting her modern accolades, as she deserves. She is one of my heroes, honestly. She was a woman who was an artistic genius, who did what she wanted regardless of the consequences. 

I love music, and I've bartended in the past which made me curate my public music choices to be publicly well received, and that often meant not choosing women centric music, but music I knew men would receive well. 

Do you find that men are willing to listen to women's music with the same good spirit as they will music made by men?

To me, good music is good music, but I feel like a lot of men dismiss female artists. 

And hell, maybe the things I love about women-made art are the things that alienate male consumers of art.

of all the crushes ive had in my life, none of them actually had me desiring or fantasizing about sex. but my boyfriend made me actually WANT to try. i want to have sex with him. i told him all about how i‚Äôd never put anything in there and we were each other‚Äôs first relationship so he was willing to wait as long as i needed before trying sex. i started practicing penetration before we tried because he‚Äôs bigger than average and i got a tampon in for the first time and i was super excited and proud of myself. it was small though, so to work my way up i bought a small vibrator, it‚Äôs thin, thicker than a tampon but definitely not as thick as a penis. it‚Äôs four inches long as well. it was a lot harder to get in but i was able to do it with lube. it was not comfortable or pleasurable though and i definitely didn‚Äôt feel comfortable enough to try moving it in and out. it just felt really weird inside me. 

i continued trying with the vibrator for a bit and not much changed, it still continued to feel weird and maybe even a bit tight? and i always needed lube to do it even when i was really turned on and wet. eventually my boyfriend and i tried and i could not get it in very far. maybe an inch. i assumed it was just because it was the first time. as we continued to try i could get it in pretty far (not all the way though) and it would feel extremely tight, weird, uncomfortable and even painful if i let him go in deep enough. it almost feels sharp, no matter how much lube we use. sometimes he says it feels like he can‚Äôt even push any deeper, like there‚Äôs something there. ive had people tell me i need to just let it in all the way even if it hurts and after that it won‚Äôt hurt but i don‚Äôt think they understand that not only does it hurt but it also physically like, can‚Äôt go in all the way. i always tell myself i‚Äôm going to let him push it in further even if it hurts but once we get to actually trying it‚Äôs just not really feasible. we‚Äôve tried many different positions as well. i can‚Äôt help but feel like maybe my cervix is just too low or something? if that‚Äôs even possible. i know it‚Äôs supposed to elongate when you‚Äôre turned on so i have no idea honestly. is it possible to just have a vagina that‚Äôs too tight? and if this is the case is there any way to expand it? or am i just screwed?

for background i don‚Äôt know if my hymen has ever broken. it definitely hasnt broken from any of the penetration i listed because ive never bled after putting anything in. it‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs broken before but i‚Äôm not sure. ive had to put in a suppository for a yeast infection recently as well and i needed to lubricate the applicator just to get it in and it was so uncomfortable. it‚Äôs not possible that it‚Äôs a lack of arousal or lack of relaxation. it could be vaginismsus but i really don‚Äôt think it is because i‚Äôm really not scared of penetration anymore now that ive done it before. 

it makes me so sad because my boyfriend and i both want to have sex so bad and enjoy it, and he‚Äôs so supportive and comforting about it even though i know he wants to be able to do it too so bad. i have a gynecologist appointment next month and i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be able to tell me what‚Äôs wrong with me but what if i can‚Äôt even let them get the speculum tool in?? i‚Äôm scared of not being the one in control of what goes in. i can‚Äôt even get my boyfriend‚Äôs penis in so i‚Äôm really nervous for it. is there any hope for me? :(",TwoXChromosomes

It's like so many men are simultaneously trying their best to stop women from having sex yet also losing their shit because women won't sleep with them.

It's starting to feel like having a sex life as a woman is giving a big fuck you to patriarchy, but on the other hand, it also makes it inevitable that misogynists will somehow end up getting sex too. It feels like we can't win.

I can only speak for myself, but I seriously vet who I sleep with. If there is any trace of right wing incel shitbaggery I run the opposite direction. Many assholes are good at masking their assholishness, so we must be careful to only sleep with and get into relationships with good men.",TwoXChromosomes
1708472899.0,Violence against women in pre-modern civilizations makes me depressed.,"Sometimes I feel depressed from reading stories about violence against women in historical time-periods.

A while back I found an article on JSTOR titled *""coercive sex in the medieval japanese court""* which discusses the culture around sexual relationships, gender roles and sexual assault in feudal Japan, focused on an account from the memoir of lady Nijo.

Nijo was a court-lady in the 13th-century Japanese imperial court. As a toddler she was given to the court and became a concubine to the retired emperor Go-Fukakasa. In her memoir she recounts that at age 14 (which is really closer to 13 by Western standards since in Japan they count the time inside the womb) by the former emperor.

***""He handled me so mercilessly that my thin gown was being badly torn, and soon I would be left with nothing in this world, not even my name, as dawn came upon my feelings of bitter despair,""***

It's valuable as one of the only descriptions of sexual violence written from the perspective of the victim from medieval Japan that we have. Additionally, she was forced to have sex with other court men. Women's bodies in the imperial court were seen as publicly available for sexual use by men. Their consent clearly didn't matter.

How people lived in the past fascinates me, and Medieval Japan was a very different world from the west today. They were a beautiful and vibrant culture, yet extremely unequal and stratified. Women had very limited freedom and agency and unless you were nobility your life would suck. They did not have a concept of marital rape and powerful men could do pretty much what they want, just like in contemporary western countries.

**I believe that the account from Nijo would resonate with many survivors of CSA today.**

However, Nijo was more than just a victim. As a member of the aristocracy she had a lot more freedom and power than the vast majority of the population at the time. She was a poet and author who took many lovers later in life and had quite a lot of influence in court for her gender. Eventually she retired and became a nun, travelling to various historical and sacred places. But her class still didn't protect her from unwanted sexual advances.

I find it fascinating that even a thousand years ago, sexual violence against women and children was as today, if not more, especially in upper-class circles. The modern equivalent would be metoo and child sex abuse scandals in Hollywood today. 

I would love to talk to someone who is educated in history, historical gender relations and non-western civilizations (especially Japan) about this subject. ",TwoXChromosomes

The irregular bleeding has continued only now without the bc, I've getting pretty awful cramping as well, more than I ever experienced on bc. First gyn said I can try an IUD next but it won't control pain because it's only progestin.

Second gyn said an IUD will control pain. Also recommended the depo shot. Said it would help with pain and make me have fewer periods. Sent a message to the first gyn about the depo shot and he said it's used for pain from endometriosis but otherwise won't alleviate period pain.

I will say it was my fault since I did tense up, I tried hard now to, but, it was just the reaction my body had since I never had anything up there befor, I never even used a tampon befor.

But now a day later I feel so many things. All except being happy. I feel violated, upset and embarrassed. I just don‚Äôt feel good and I hate how everything turned out.

Thinking back on my ex, I realized why it took me so long to leave and why it took me so long to recognize my relationship as toxic.

He would cuddle with me all the time, always call me sweet pet names, tell me he loved me almost every day, he would always be there to listen to my problems, he would take me out to eat all the time and give me gifts.

But..he would also call me dumb and annoying when we argued, he would employ silent treatment whenever we got into disagreements, constantly throw my family problems in my face, every single thing was my fault, he would say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna smack you‚Äù as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù, pushing me to be sexual even when I was not in the mood, he would squeeze, bite and pinch me to the point that it hurt (he said it was a sign of his love) and he wouldn‚Äôt stop when I said it hurt.

1708462046.0,It bothers me that PaxTube thinks that the way many anime girls act is representative of even traditional femininity.,"I came across a video from PaxTube where he talks about why people like anime girls. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2prtR2ZNIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2prtR2ZNIk) Before watching, I first glanced at his channel and noticed numerous red flags such as him arguing that the crusades were ""good"" and other questionable stuff. You could say that he was conservative, but to be honest, I don't know if I want to generalize them for reasons I'm about to get into. Anyway, I checked out his anime video out of morbid curiosity and was quite dumbfounded.

Now, he says many things that I find puzzling such as his ""studies"" of promiscuous people having less-happy marriages than those than abstained from sex before marrying; and that feminism basically ""ruined"" everything with how women are trying to ""act like men"" (which I find puzzling as even historically, men and women shared numerous jobs. Even during way, women had to fight back when their settlements were under siege). But the main thing I want to focus on is the fact he thinks the way many girls behave in anime is even representative of ""traditional"" femininity.

Just to clarify, not all anime girls behave the same. Many are indeed well-written or at least behave like actual human beings. But what bothers me is are the examples PaxTube uses for feminine strengths. For instance, he uses a scene from Love Lab where the girl blushes immensely and loses herself just over a guy calling her cute. And many of the other examples he uses are girls who are basically extremely simple-minded, fixated on their love interests or family, or just acting bubbly/childish. He doesn't even show them doing anything, just looking cute and vulnerable.

The reason this bothers me is because he seems to think that traditional femininity is this simple. I'd hate to state the obvious, but PaxTube doesn't seem to grasp that women in general are still just as human as men. Even with traditional roles, they were and still can be hard at work (historically, they worked in numerous jobs like farmwork, factories, textile work, etc.), be capable of nuanced emotions, and other obvious stuff. Frankly, the characters he shows in the video are a dumbed down and fetishized representation of femininity.

Even from a conservative perspective, PaxTube has an insultingly simple idea of what traditional femininity was/is. You'd think that he'd talk about all the nuances and hard work that women do with ""traditional"" roles (I put in quotation marks because even roles have varied between times and places). But no, he seems to think that overly-emotional, vulnerable, and simple-minded anime girls are representative of femininity. Frankly, I'm disgusted of him.

I currently work a full-time 9-5 job with the Canadian federal government. Keep in mind that only like 30% of autistics are employed in Canada.

I corrected him and told him how treatable testicular cancer is, and how screening isn't required because the symptoms appear early. I told him how we lose around 55 men in the UK to testicular cancer, and over 1000 women to cervical cancer, and how this is because cervical cancer is very hard to detect and still isn't tested from an early enough age. I told him told him told him.

It‚Äôs caused me to hate being even touched by anyone. Hugs, shoulder touches, anything. I mean I won‚Äôt even hug my nephew when he wants one because I don‚Äôt want to have him feel uncomfortable.

The only time I can be turned on is losing myself in reading. Putting myself in the fictional stories I read. And after I‚Äôm obviously left unsatisfied.

I‚Äôve just realized that this. All of this has caused me so much stress anxiety and fear and has held me back. I hate that I‚Äôm not affectionate. Or that I‚Äôm always suspicious of everyone. It‚Äôs not fun.

And I want to find love. So badly. And I know even telling a man anything about my past can put a lot of pressure on him if that man is even just a little interested in being with me.

So I‚Äôm asking for help finally. Where do I start? Who do I ask? I can‚Äôt ask anyone I know in real life. I‚Äôm not comfortable with it. 

Please any advice would be appreciated.

This is someone fresh out of uni, about 10 years my junior, who has been in his (first full time) job at my company for 4 months. I‚Äôve been in my job (a supervisory role to his role) for 3 years and have qualifications in my specific area of expertise. I trained him in his role for his first 2 months. His degree is in an unrelated field.

He holds various sexist and racist views, and is happy to proclaim these loudly to anyone who didn‚Äôt ask. He has an extremely high opinion of himself and thinks everything he says is fact with no attempt to think critically. 


He has spent the better part of today telling me that I‚Äôm doing my main project incorrectly. For example, according to him,  xyz aren‚Äôt important and I should just be ignoring them. Xyz are the legal specifications, aka the cornerstones of the project. Without them, the company would be acting illegally. He is confident in his conviction because he has been in one group meeting about it‚Ä¶one. 2 weeks ago. I have been doing this particular project for 2.5 years. I am even literally fresh off a week long in-depth course on this particular niche topic.


After leaving work I was told by another coworker that this guy is going round telling people I‚Äôm doing my project wrong. A project that has been in the works for 5 years, involving multiple people and companies that he has no clue about because he‚Äôs been here all of five minutes. I‚Äôm utterly fuming.

Why is this making the women in my life cry and say ""you might change your mind"" ""this is a huge decision"" ""freeze your eggs asap."" I'm having to just make the appointments without telling any loved ones because they'll freak out at me.

In the unlikely scenario that I do decide I want a child I would 1000% adopt. Why doesn't anyone even consider this option?

1708451483.0,(Long Rant) being a masculine looking woman struggling with finding confidence ,"(Sorry if some of this doesn't make sense!! I'll try to clarify in the comments if someone asks)

it's something that I've struggled with my entire life growing up and going to public school I've always been bullied for being ugly or wearing different clothing from the norm,  All the way until highschool in which I've extremely focused on my looks and tried to make myself look good, wearing more expensive clothing especially in shoes in order to fit in and earrings but that still didn't work in the way as I hoped. I still got bullied.

Growing up, I've always been told I look like a tomboy because I wear hoodies? I don't care for dresses, really, but I've never been able to find one that suits what I like style wise. But I definitely don't like short shirts. And as for hair styles, I go with something basic and easy to do, not really stylized, but typically, i dont have the time for that. 

I guess that's kind of affected me in ways I wouldn't have expected. Guys see me more as a bro, just one of the guys, but not as a crush or a girl they think is pretty I remember I used to see them talking to this beautiful girl I used to be friends with and honestly I had a crush on her aswell but they were nervous when they talked to her, they asked me and other friends with her for advice/things she liked and ""made themselves seem cooler"" so that she'd be interested in them 

I don't expect them to do the same with me. someone they obviously don't care about, but I felt kinda jealous? Not of the guys or the girl in question, I wanted to feel WANTED, I wished someone was interested in me to that degree.

Now I know some people will probably be like ""girl wtf you're probably beautiful?"" But I literally look like if Shrek was wearing a short brown haired wig and was skinny lol

I used to follow this girl on Instagram, I don't use the app anymore, but she looks absolutely beautiful, and we have somewhat similar features. It makes me so sad because I wish I could look as beautiful as her. She has some of my features that I hate, but they look perfectly on her.

I've seen guys talk about how hard it is to get a girlfriend, but sometimes I feel like it's the opposite. To have a guy be interested in you it's mostly a look based thing you have to look attractive before they eventually get to know your personality and I feel like when people get to know me they clearly like me and like the things I'm interested in but if they were to just see my face they wouldn't interact. 

I used to use discord aswell and I was good at making friends, telling jokes, making people laugh and people actually enjoyed talking to me which was great but I got extremely nervous when they asked me to send a picture of myself I felt like if I showed them they wouldn't want to be friends with me anymore so I always pushed it away and said another time. But I even had people so interested in my personality that they developed a crush on me??? Which first off is like woah.. I never even interacted with anyone romanticly so that's also really odd but them being interested in me in that way increased my fear that if I appeared ugly to them once I showed myself, they'd hate me or their feelings for me would disappear.

I constantly get confused for a guy whenever I go to the DMV or when meeting a cousin I've never met before, at a restaurant, school, at a store, etc

I wish I didn't look like a guy, I wish I looked more feminine, a term I've found myself relating to in the past 5 or 4 years is Non-binary because I find myself not really fitting in with the roles we've assigned to with gender (not explaining this this way i wanted to sorry !!!!) And to closer to the term androgynous buttttttt...... if people never even confuse me for a girl in the first place, then üòÆ‚Äçüí®

Honestly going off of this ‚¨ÜÔ∏è if there was a button that could turn me into a guy I would press that immediately I feel like it would just make me more happier and it's easier to appear more masculine than feminine, I wouldn't have alot of these stresses. I've thought about it, and I don't think I'm trans. but I know if I went in that direction the only thing that would make me happy is taking medication, getting alot of surgery and it isn't guaranteed that I would look the way I wanted too, plus it would be expensive. and surgery is also something I'm worried about 

I'm sure part of it is my fault, again I don't wear make up (I'm sorta interested in eyeliner), I don't wear dresses or skirts, or show much skin, I don't wear my earrings much but it's hard to find some in my style. but I feel like even if I did try these things, I'd just be assumed to be a more feminine guy than a girl. Maybe I'm stupid for thinking that 

What's even crazier is I'm not super interested in finding a significant other at the moment but being a girl it feels as if our self worth is tied to our looks it's hard not to be super focused on these sorts of things. even as a child, it's drilled into our heads that beauty is pain

But idk. Any advice?? Clearly, I struggle with my confidence, but I'm trying

I‚Äôve had Kyleena for about 1.5 years. For the first 8 months, I loved it - no side effects at all and no period. About eight months in, I noticed heavy discharge where I need a liner or pad. Slight odor. Got it checked out and my gynecologist said it was nothing serious, no infection. Uncomfortable, but manageable. However, the last 3-4 months my breast get extremely tender, sore and enlarged. I‚Äôve gone from a full C to a DD on a really bad/uncomfortable day. I haven‚Äôt gained weight and in fact lost a few inches from strength training. I‚Äôm only 4‚Äô11 and 105lbs so it is really uncomfortable and taking a toll on my mental health. Also having more bloating after I eat and cramping in general. 

I have an apt next week for removal but wanted to know if anyone experienced this while on Kyleena? IUDs don‚Äôt seem to impact breast growth/tissue, but not my experience so far. For those who get it removed, did your breast go back to their pre-birth control size? I‚Äôm 32 as well so not sure if this is normal changes as I age.

To give you some context, I had seen the movie with Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgees earlier but found it to be mediocre, the series however, is top-knotch and I highly recommend it. 

In the series, they basically cast an Indian origin actress for an otherwise british character. Ambika Mod has done justice to her character otherwise but people are at it, complaining about diversity again. This time, it's worse because I made the mistake of reading comments on reddit and found so utterly disgusting ones where people are saying stuff like ""it's a little unbelievable that a white handsome man would fall for her"" ""she's not pretty"" ""in real life, he wouldn't lay eyes on her""

Oh it's very funny that because the girl looks average to some, they will point that out to death but I've seen so many shit movies and shows where the woman is a catch unlike the man but no one ever finds that to be a problem? 

The worst thing in all of this is the race factor. Oh and I've heard stuff before as an Indian woman by white men online that I shouldn't have high standards because we're on average ""ugly and undesirable"".

1708447268.0,How do I fix my broken view of love and relationships?,"So I've (23F) never been in a relationship before. 

As a teenager, I largely turned to fantasies, and media for escapism in order to cope with the insecurity that I felt. It led me to building up """"perfect"""" partners in my head and I started to develop the idea that all the waiting would be worth it if my ideal person  would eventually find me.

College came and went and besides going on a few dates here and there, I still remained single. Every date that I went on, I would reach a point where I'd ask myself, ""Can I really see myself in an intimate, committed relationship with this person?"" and the answer would always be No. I wasn't interested in any casual relationships as I know them to be largely sexual and I did not and do not want my first time to be a hook up.

Since then, I've put quite a bit of effort into working on myself: applying to grad school, going to therapy, putting a little more effort into my appearance, developing new hobbies/interests, practicing self love and saying affirmations + expressing gratitude every day.  I'm the happiest being single I've been in a LONG time. 

However, I think that my overall view on love and dating still needs a lot of work. 

I cannot let go of my ideal partner. I think that I have definitely matured in my expectations and do NOT expect perfect in any way but I do have qualities that impact my attraction. Unfortunately, I've found that looks do play a significant part. I don't have a set list of physical traits but finding someone physically attractive is a big deal for me. I had many instances on the apps where I had likes from people who I just wasn't physically attracted to and it led to low matches. 

I realize now that finding someone physically attractive who also possesses great internal qualities is very difficult. 

I also have a very poor view of marriage and lifelong relationships. I've been surrounded by unhappy marriages/relationships my whole life and it has led me to believe that marriage is kinda miserable by default. I know this isn't true but it's very hard for me to see myself with the same person for 20+ years without things getting very dull and lifeless. 

I know that I have a very warped view of love but I don't know how to go about fixing it since so much of it is so deeply ingrained. Does anyone have any potential advice?

After my period went away it was clear signs of a yeast infection. I tried Monistat 1 day ( Miconazole Nitrate) and after a week from using it symptoms came back. 2 weeks later I tried CVS Health Tioconazole 3 day treatment about a week after finishing the treatment the symptoms came back.

Illness is a cause for concern, and having to console and convince a jumping up and down adult relative who is now excited at the PROSPECT of me being pregnant when I've just thrown up and feel awful, is embarrassing.

1708442266.0,Stopped getting my period and NP say its normal.,"About two years ago, after I hit 30, my period just...tapered off and came intermittently if at all. I was always lucky to have a fairly light and easy period (on birth control), only lasted about 4-5 days and often wasn't a heavy flow. I've been taking birth control for well over 10 years now. About two years ago it started to not come at all or if it did, it was barely anything. I went to my Nurse practitioner, and they ran some blood tests, and I received an ultrasound on my ovaries. My testosterone was 0.1 level above the limit and my ultrasound showed nothing. My NP told me that this was all normal, normal to stop getting your period, it just happens! Since the testosterone levels were only 0.1 above it was likely just a stage in my cycle that naturally has elevated testosterone. 

I've since stopped taking birth control and I got my period the first month, but now nothing at all....I took a pregnancy test and that was negative. It just seems so WEIRD to not get my period anymore with absolutely no explanation! My NP made me feel like it was a GOOD think to not have to deal with my period anymore, but I think it's something I SHOULD be having. I think it's normal and healthy to have your period each month.

When I looked at him, he too also looked at me. I thought nothing of it, then turned my head back towards the library. I looked to my right again after a few seconds  and saw he was slowly walking towards me. Directly towards, not a little to the left or right, directly, and he was facing me too. I thought to myself, ‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs just moving to the bus shelter next to me‚Äù, as I was starting to panic and freeze, since he had started walking in my direction when he noticed me. But no, he walked past the bus shelter and was still slowly heading for me. I was also starting to slowly step away, I had no idea what this guy wanted or was going to do and I didn‚Äôt want to find out. There was nobody else around, my heart was beating like crazy. He was about 4 metres away and still walking when I thought ‚ÄúFuck this‚Äù, I wasn‚Äôt going to find out.  

I swiftly turned around and crossed the street, not looking back, and walked up the steps to the train station. I noticed a large group of PSOs (police officers that patrol train stations) but I didn‚Äôt think of going to them. I went up the 2nd set of stairs that took me up to the town shops, and went inside a subway shop. I was shaking and told the employee that a man was following me. He told me to stay inside. 

A minute later, the man following me had slowly walked past the subway shop, looking into the glass window while walking but trying to not make it seem like that. I was panicking, and told the employee that was the man and tried to hide behind him. I nearly jumped behind the counter, the guy walked past finally and the employee walked outside to see if the man was gone. He was, but I had no idea if he saw me. The worker gave me his phone to call my dad to get my auntie to pick me up. 
While waiting and since the man was gone, I went up to the PSOs and told them what happened and about the man. I gave them his description and where he might‚Äôve went, etc. One of them said they did see me and the man before at the bus shelters so that would‚Äôve helped with finding him. They told me it was suspicious and they all split up to search the area for the man while I left with my aunt.  

There is no doubt that man was following me as he had came out from the exact same path I had taken to get to subway, and that he must‚Äôve not  even been catching a bus if he followed me immediately and left the bus stop when he saw me. I am still a bit shaken up from it and will not be taking strolls in the afternoon for a long time in fear of seeing the man again, just school then straight home for the rest of the night unless going out with friends.

I‚Äôve been on hormonal bc on and off since I was 16. I‚Äôve been on the pill for the past three years and the negative effects are really catching up to me. My anxiety is awful and I feel like I cannot, for the life of me, enjoy anything. Even things I used to love I don‚Äôt feel joy doing them anymore. I‚Äôm 99% sure this is the birth control causing this, I‚Äôve tried antidepressants and they made me feel 10x worse than I do now! My libido has also been awful the past 6 months.

My GP recommended I try the copper coil. I have an appointment booked on the 14th of March to get this put in. I‚Äôm terrified tbh and I‚Äôve done so much research. I know the common side effects and I know what to expect with regards to the coil. Some people have terrifying experiences and the others have amazing experiences. I know it depends on the person.

Would anyone feel comfortable sharing their experiences with me? I‚Äôd really appreciate it, I feel like it will put my mind at rest.

I also have no idea what to expect with regards to coming off of hormonal birth control. I know with the copper IUD your cycle is normal as it would be without the hormonal bc, but because I‚Äôve been on the pill for so long, I have no idea what my natural period is like anymore!

1708433964.0,Having a support system is crucial,"Recently, I realized how crucial it is to have a support system for a woman.

I (29F) was recently married in August 2023 to someone who I thought would be my life partner. Over the initial few months, he hadn‚Äôt moved in due to stuff with his lease and we were also going to do his greencard. I hadn‚Äôt really let him come over due to being hit with a major depressive episode to where I wasn‚Äôt cleaning and he got it in his head that I was hiding a guy. I also come home late due to work, where I travel a lot.

Over the last month, he got more controlling and possessive. He started restricting what I wore, commenting on my make up (not to use it), insulting my appearance (saying I wasn‚Äôt attractive one day then complimenting me on another), throwing a fuss if I talked with family, not wanting me to shake hands with men, says he likes me one day and then another day he tolerates me and doesn‚Äôt like me, saying we forced him into marrying me, and eventually threatening to kill me if I cheated on him. He passed it off as a joke afterwards and claimed that I was too sensitive.

I was miserable for the last few weeks. People could tell that something was off. I kept having panic attacks of him moving in with me. Not because I was cheating, which he could easily check my phone/computer/location, but because of his attitude and threat.

I went out with my mom yesterday and also told some of my friends. It felt great to feel validated to where I had support and an escape plan (which we are still working on, since it has only been less than 24 hours).

I urge you, ladies, to always try to have a support system before getting in a relationship. And to open up, no matter how hard it is, to someone. Even if it is a friend or coworker because you don‚Äôt have a decent family, do it.

Always save up a bit as ‚Äòbail money‚Äô if things seem off. After a couple years, you don‚Äôt need to use it, but keep it in mind. And if someone starts behaving this way, leave. They‚Äôre not worth it. You are.


**Update 02/20/24:**

I used sick leave and changed the locks, then told my apartment complex. My neighbors are gems who are keeping an eye out. I‚Äôm also working on filing a police report for in case I have to file a restraining order later. I have family who may stay over and keep me company.

My apartment is looking into possibly transferring me to another unit, just in case. I am currently working on removing him from any utility accounts and so on.

Emotionally, I‚Äôm a mess. I feel a mix of guilt for leaving, drained, grief, betrayal, but also an intense sense of relief. It was getting to the point of that I went to get hot pot on Sunday and I‚Äôm like ‚Äòoh I shouldn‚Äôt tell my husband, he‚Äôll get angry that I‚Äôm going out and think I‚Äôm cheating as people usually go to hotpot together‚Äô. Then I realized so what if I‚Äôm going out, I‚Äôm not doing anything wrong.

Feeling all of these emotions is normal. It takes time to process it. It also takes time to build yourself up. 

I‚Äôm hoping that this post can help other women. If/once it goes into the legal route, I won‚Äôt update on the legal things much. But I will update on the emotional and mental side because a lot of people will need to know that it is completely okay to feel things like grief, guilt, betrayal, relief, and so on. It‚Äôs okay to scream and cry. It‚Äôs okay to feel ‚Äòam I doing the right thing‚Äô (you will second guess yourself due to abuse, but you can do so much better). There‚Äôs nothing wrong with all of this. You‚Äôre strong and can get through this.

**Update 02/25/24:**

So I told the rest of my family on Friday night and they decided to have my husband meet them, while I was at home (in case he turned violent). As he doesn‚Äôt have a car, he was asking me to give him a ride. Then he decided to take a Lyft. He took a Lyft to parent‚Äôs house, which was where I was. Thankfully, I had called my mom and asked if anyone was supposed to come. She had my grandparents‚Äô caretaker check and send him away, while I hid upstairs in the bathroom for a while.

I ended up telling his family and him that I was leaving. He immediately started yelling to take him back, he wasn‚Äôt like this, I was lying, he meant things as a joke, and so on. He was crying and begging. Then I told him to speak to my lawyer and blocked him.

I felt guilty. He was supposed to move in with me and had a few days to find a new place. But I had to leave. The sheer terror that I felt was not normal. Hiding from my husband is not normal.

Fortunately, he agreed to signing the papers. If everything goes smoothly, we should have our marriage annuled by May (about 61 days).

For all women, here are the steps that I did-
1. I waited until I was in a location with others to confront him
2. I got a police report done
3. I changed locks
4. I notified both my work and apartment (include neighbors)
5. I also notified his family (in case he spreads rumors)
6. I immediately began looking into lawyers as some work pro-bono, others don‚Äôt
7. I looked into restraining/protective orders
8. I saved screenshots of old texts where I was being harrassed and had a log of things
9. I played along so he didn‚Äôt suspect anything/come down to see me
10. I told myself that I was strong and could do it.

1708427599.0,How to stop feeling too old at 30?,"I lost 3 decades to mental illness and have only started to get better about 2 years ago. I always had huge dreams. Big dreams. That I will one day have a tech company and be this big important CEO.

When I turned 30 I felt liberated that I finally feel mature and have escaped the horrible 20s. But I also started feeling like all the big goals I had for myself were now impossible.

And the only reason why I feel they are impossible is because we as women were told for decades that the second we turn 30 our looks start to fade away, we have to get serious and dedicate our lives to finding a husband and having kids. After all, your youth is gone and only a husband and children will love your new face.

But I never wanted a partner or children. I have always been single because I have no desire to have anyone. I just wanted to be successful. I wanted to achieve, and despite mental illness I knew one day I would follow those dreams.

Yesterday I saw the news that an ex-Disney actress Bridgit Mendler co-founded and is a CEO of a space company. She also studies at MIT and Harvard. She is only 31.

I cried when I read that. It reminded me of my dreams and what I could have if I were healthy.

She started building her castle in her twenties and now gets to enjoy view at barely 31 years old. If I start today, I will (hopefully) start tasting the fruits when I am close to 40. 40!!

I just cannot get this thought out of my head that getting older as a woman and not having youthful appearance will make me somehow have less value as a businesswoman.

Up until now I haven‚Äôt really dated, partially because it wasn‚Äôt immediately obvious how a man could improve my life. I was basing this on my observations of a lot of my friend‚Äôs relationships- their husbands seem to be expect to be mothered to some degree. Having been single and self-sufficient for so long I just couldn‚Äôt tolerate this, so I have deliberately tried to create a relationship where I am not taking on the majority of household chores or mental load. For example- a friend invited me and my partner to her birthday party. I told my partner about the date of the party and that I‚Äôd like him to come. I did not check in with my partner to see if he‚Äôd requested that night off work. He did not, and consequently was unable to attend the party with me (which I know he would have liked to have attended, and consequently tried to find cover and was unsuccessful). Maybe this sounds harsh, but I value my peace and I don‚Äôt want to spend my life looking after a large child. Edit: when this happened I didn‚Äôt guilt or blame my partner, I knew it was an oversight but honestly I found it a good experience for the both of us.

1708418122.0,26f given up on finding a man to have a family with,"I used to dream of being a mom and having a family one day, and a loving husband. After years a dating and experience with men and some short relationships, I have very little faith. I feel like it‚Äôs safe to say 90% of men are abusers, misogynistic, or just shitty people. I have been physically, emotionally and verbally abused by SO MANY MEN. And no, it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm picking a type, even men from grade school bullied me/SA‚Äôd me and as an adult I‚Äôve had men come up to me on the street and yell in my face that I‚Äôm ugly. I‚Äôve been raped and taken advantage of multiple times. Mostly from people I trusted and was dating.

I hear stories on the news all the time of women being unalived by their partners. When I‚Äôve ended things with men I‚Äôve dated who seemed to be nice and sweet for the months I was getting to know them, they immediately start insulting me and attacking me, so I learn the ‚Äúnice front‚Äù was all a lie. I don‚Äôt believe men genuinely respect women, they want to use us to make them feel good, whether it‚Äôs an ego boost or sex. Also the stark difference in treatment I get when I look good vs ‚Äúbad‚Äù, I‚Äôm not treated as a human when a man doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm attractive. I get pushed aside, cut in lines, etc (5‚Äô3 here so it‚Äôs easy for them to overpower me). 

If a man ever does try to date me, I will not believe anything he does or says is coming from a genuine place at this point. I think I will just accept not having children and maybe eventually find a female life partner. I have no problem adopting. I always wanted to experience pregnancy and childbirth, so maybe sperm doner. 

Even men who aren‚Äôt outwardly violent and hateful, a lot of them sit around and expect us to be their mom, clean after them, cook, etc.. with no effort from their end. 

Also, I refuse to use dating apps anymore. It‚Äôs like hell, never know what your getting into swiping on a picture and it feels SO superficial.

just a few months ago was the one year anniversary of breaking up with my previous partner of nearly 5 years. this was someone who i was very happy with, but ultimately decided was not someone i could grow with as we were in very different places in our lives. we broke up amicably, though it was very hard on both of us. we‚Äôd been almost perfectly happy, though i had been carrying with me for a long time the truth that i was afraid to face, that i didn‚Äôt want to be with him forever and if i didn‚Äôt end things now i never would. 

this was the hardest thing i‚Äôve ever done as it simultaneously was so intuitively the right thing for me and at the same time felt so wrong to end this relationship with someone i did still love, but knew wasn‚Äôt best for me. it tore me up, and i know it did the same to him. even so, we ended things and there were no hard feelings, only grief that the relationship was over. 

just a few months later i started dating someone i‚Äôd met through work and we clicked immediately. i had never felt so safe so quickly with anyone before, and everything felt right. we were the same age (my ex had been significantly older than me) and were in very similar places. it felt like all of the little things i had been missing in my previous relationship i was now finding with him. 

now, this isn‚Äôt about to take a turn for the worse. we‚Äôre still together a year later and extremely happy. we‚Äôve cultivated the safest relationship i have ever been in, safer and closer than any family or friendships i‚Äôve had. i laugh with him like i never have with anyone and i feel like myself for the first REAL time in my life. i feel so incredibly lucky. neither of us are perfect, but we‚Äôve never left anything unsaid and always openly and honestly work through anything that comes up. point is, i am very happy and know that i made the right choices if it brought me here. 

the thing that weighs on me is guilt. i feel still so guilty that i took away a future from my previous partner that he was so sure of. a year later, and i still feel so cruel for how badly i know it hurt him. i know, of course, that i do not owe my life to anyone and i definitely don‚Äôt deserve to feel guilty for doing the right thing for me. what really hurts is when i reminisce about that relationship and all the lovely memories i made with him. then i feel guilty for thinking so fondly on a past relationship whilst i‚Äôm in one, i feel guilty for breaking my ex‚Äôs heart, and i feel sad that i feel these things. 

i think all i really want to say is that i often have to remind myself that it is okay, even healthy to grieve endings. i‚Äôm allowed to grieve a beautiful relationship that gave me so much but ultimately not everything i needed. i may do that in some way for the rest of my life and this still does not take away the joy and love i feel now. 

holding both of these as truths is difficult, but i believe is so important. all the same, it is heavy. i don‚Äôt know if anyone reading this has felt a similar feeling, but i‚Äôm putting this out there in the hopes someone has and needs to know that they are entitled to their feelings and their life.

1708417667.0,I finally listened to old recordings from my abusive relationship and I can't believe I lived through it.,"My ex was going through a lengthy BP disorder manic episode. I brought up my concerns multiple times about their deteriorating mental state in the months leading up to the total breakdown and asked them to please see their GP to inquire about getting proper help as I recognized some worrisome signs from experience with previous episodes (2 previous episodes). I was anxious about where it would lead to and they brushed aside my concerns every. single. time. Saying not to worry or accusing me of being jealous (because they'd only eat dinner and lost ~15-30 pounds and suddenly look ripped) or some other appeasement... 

I'm introverted and they were ""my person"", the only one I opened myself up to fully and thought I had in my corner. The total 180 left me completely devasted and floundering. I don't have a big family support network. My older sister was also involved in a financially and emotionally abusive relationship, so when I'd call her for support, she would tell me should couldn't handle it my issues right now and had to go. 

A few months leading up to the total breakdown of our relationship when I noticed behavioral changes, I started saving ""*TheirName*-isms"" on my Phone. Things they'd call me or when they'd put me down so I wouldn't forget. They literally performed a song for me about how much I sucked (yes, I recorded it).

We also had a Ring-type camera set up in our living room so many of our arguments were recorded in video and audio until one day they remembered it and disconnected it. 

Some examples:

*""Thank god I don't have to look at your ugly mug anymore!*""

 
*""Shut your fat face, what do I have to say to shut you up?""* - 

(it doesn't really matter but I literally weighed ~100lbs at this time and had lost weight from 108-112lbs from the stress I was going through. By the time I had moved out, I weighed 95lbs.)


 *""Shut your fat face. You don't shut up when you're supposed to.""*


Because I asked them to repay me when they promised to, they claimed they were too busy to do a 30 second e-transfer transaction:

*""What the hell's wrong with you?""*


**ME:** But today, right? 

*YEAH!*


**ME:** Well, you told me you'd do it tom-well, yesterday-


*""___ get off my fucking case, I'm busy. I'm going to do it today, end of story. I'm busy. You know what that means? I'm busy. I have a time limit. I'm not thinking about that.""*

**Me:** All I asked was -

""No, I-I , no, be quiet. I know what you asked, I know exactly what you asked. I know everything about what you're saying. I'm just not doing it right now. I'm busy! Calm down! 

**Me:** But a-all, all you have to do is...

""When I'm done, I'll send it. When I'm ready. [...] Are you asking me to send the money when I have the chance? Because that's what I said I'm going to do. 

**Me**: Okay, I don't understand why you flipped out on me.

""What flipping out? You said the same thing ten times in a row. As soon as I get the chance, I'll do it, now leave me alone because I'm busy. 

**Me: Well, if you'd done it yesterday like you said you would-**

*""No, it's not essential""* 

**Me:** It is essential!

[...]*""Thanks for that wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, way of just intermittent, fuck up my fucking mood. Buh-bye, I love you! See you later! See you on Sunday. Thanks for your fucking misery. [...] Bye! I love you! (huge sigh) Thanks a lot, ____, I appreciate all your fucking positivity, as always.""*


They finally leave and close the front door and you can hear our cats suddenly meowing. Like as soon as their awful energy left the apartment, the cats felt safe to come out and 'chat' to me.

**SPOILER ALERT:** They never re-paid me. They would pawn my possessions and made me spend my own money to repurchase them. I had to bribe/pay them off for some peace and quiet for a day or two so they could afford their vices and partying and leave me alone otherwise they'd just harass me endlessly, blackmail me (threaten my job), keep me awake, and steal my valuables to pawn for money.



If I hadn't saved notes & voice recordings like that, I would never have remembered, as that period of time in my life is like a blank slate from the sleep deprivation and stress.

The jury came out with a not guilty verdict today for all 3 charges. They deliberated for about 7hrs. I was expecting a verdict last week but closing arguments took a lot longer than I thought they would as they had more legal argument following.

The prosecutor reminded me today that not guilty doesn't mean innocent. It just means they didn't have enough evidence to say without a doubt he was guilty. He also advised me that 7hrs is a long time and that shows they did actually believe me, just not enough to be absolutely confident. 

My biggest frustration is with the system itself.

Even if you admit guilt during a recorded phone call with the police, apparently a good lawyer can say you were ""cold called"" and you would say anything to get off the phone. I also overheard the barrister and judge during legal argument while the jury was dismissed saying disgusting things about me, like how I had no bruises or injuries and didn't even fight him off. Because of this, it was pretty obvious the judge was shutting down certain questioning from the prosecutor as well as evidence that reflected badly on the defence witnesses. 

Overall, I wasn't expecting any of this. I wasn't expecting a trial lasting 12 days, 4 days of me testifying, 10 character witnesses for the defence, but most importantly I never ever expected to make that phone call with the police or even a statement. 

I think it's pretty bad ass to go to a police station and talk about the most traumatising thing that's happened to you. I think it's pretty bad ass to stand up to a defence barrister and not let them break you. I think it's especially bad ass to respond to an aggressive barrister accusing you of making up sexual assaults with ""were you there?"". All my good zingers keep looping in my head which makes me smile. 

The other pros are this. I got to stand up to my rapist. He heard me speak the truth and saw how strong I am. He also has this on his record. If anyone in the future makes a statement it will absolutely be taken seriously. And he also had to have spent a good $100k on legal fees which makes me chuckle.

I want to end it on a good note instead of fuck him and fuck the system. So I'll say this. I'm pretty sure I have unlocked new superpowers based on what I went through. I'm a SAHM to a 7 month old baby who I lovingly cared for every single day. I cared for all my animals, maintained my home, managed to see friends and family all while going through this. I think we're all capable of so much but we just don't know it. So I celebrated me tonight by having a glass of wine with my partner and giving my baby the best snuggles ever.

1708407432.0,"""She eventually breaks up with him because he was too nice.""","Today I saw a POV video on TikTok, and the premise is that when you are on a date with a ""good guy,"" it can be confusing and difficult to adjust to at first. But the point is, the dating market is so bad out here for women that when a decent man enters the picture, it can be a pleasant shock.

The first few comments I see on this video is ""She eventually broke up with him because he was too nice,"" ""then after that she left him,"" ""then they leave,"" ""she gone leave for been too loyal.""

These men are projecting and DELUSIONAL. I bet they are the men that think they are ""nice guys"" but have so little self-awareness that they DARE associate themselves with the kind boyfriend shown in that video. When they are nothing like him. The man in that video is gentle, patient, washing the dishes, and seems to be very into the girl he is dating. Honestly, it isn't groundbreaking, what he is doing. But these men commenting have never done what he is doing for a woman and DELULU because they are saying basically ""yeah, I did that before but the girl left me so what is the point, women are h\*es"". They have the audacity to think they are anything comparable to the man in that video.

STOP. SAYING. THAT. WOMEN. LEAVE. NICE. GUYS.

1. No one fucking owes you a date. Even if you are ""nice."" Yes, even ""nice guys"" can suffer rejections. It is what dating is, it is not a rejection of your looks or character, it can sometimes be a mismatch in life, or an incompatibility.
2. The fact that women have agency and the freedom to leave, even if you are ""nice"" and ""loyal,"" does not give you an excuse to NOT be KIND AND LOYAL!!!! I hate it when men say they are tired of being nice and decide to become d\*cks -- excuse me, that shows me you never, ever were a nice person. A person chooses to be decent because that is who they are, not because it will get them p\*ssy.
3. Women hating nice guys, real, actual nice guys, that is a myth. Women LOVE nice guys. It is just that we are emotionally intelligent (on average) so we can smell bullshit a mile away. We can smell when you are being nice for the sake of getting ""lucky,"" and not because you are actually nice. You see that guy getting all the girls fawning over him? Yeah, if you think he is an asshole, you are just jealous. There, I said it. Guys are so mean to the men who actually value women and treat women like people because they can't understand that women know when a man is an actually good, decent person and feel safe enough to pursue them. You are confused why that ONE guy is getting dates while you are unable to? Actually get to know him. See how he treats women. There you go.

1708405719.0,Partner (cis male) doesn‚Äôt believe in showing solidarity over health concerns,"When my partner found out about health conditions I took initiative to cut certain foods out of our diets and I am mindful about what is/isn‚Äôt healthy for him. When I try to do the same he is verbally supportive, but then is frequently offering me foods I‚Äôve said I don‚Äôt want to eat and is unwilling to reduce his consumption out of solidarity.

I think it‚Äôs caring to show solidarity. I don‚Äôt expect him to cut something out for me 100%, but I‚Äôm trying to reduce my alcohol intake and he still drinks every night. He‚Äôs being very defensive about this and doesn‚Äôt think he should have to give up (cut down on) something he enjoys just because I want to have less of it.

I‚Äôve heard statistics that women are far more likely to stay with their husband if they become ill and care for them, whereas men are actually more likely to leave. I know this is small potatoes by comparison, but it does worry me to think about how he‚Äôd handle a serious situation. 

Curious to hear others thoughts on this. 

Edit: I wrote this terribly putting defensive right after alcohol. I don‚Äôt think he has a drinking problem. I don‚Äôt mind him having a drink to relax (not that it‚Äôs up to me anyways). Alcohol is one of a couple things I‚Äôm trying to reduce. If I had to reword this I would choose another example like candy. There is nothing wrong with eating candy in moderation. I would appreciate it if he was mindful that I was trying to reduce my candy consumption and stopped eating it every night because it is very tempting. Especially on days where I‚Äôm having a tough time.

Second edit: This is not about him cutting out foods for me altogether. It‚Äôs about him not eating things I really want and am trying to cut out right in front of me when I‚Äôm having a tough time. I regret using the words diet and solidarity. What he eats is entirely up to him and I could care less if he‚Äôs not doing it in front of me frequently or at least reduces it until I can settle in to new restrictions. ",TwoXChromosomes

I was reading a post here and saw the comment ""Ladies, please stop dating men who don't like you!""

A little more than a year ago, I got out of a relationship I wasted nearly a decade in. I made myself so small trying to please a man who was never going to be happy with me because he isn't happy in himself. He uses sex to replace intimacy, and control to combat his crippling insecurities. He avoids emotional labor and growth at all costs. We were polyamorous, but I learned more about what not to do than I learned about good poly practices from him. We mutually agreed to end our relationship after a month of my ex spiraling into increasingly controlling and abusive behaviors because I had begun dating someone who showed me the love, care and respect that I deserved, and my ex could not cope. My ex claimed to love me, my outgoing nature, my warmth, and my looks. He sabotaged my health until I was nearly obese. He pouted or manufactured conflicts every time I connected with anyone else. I stopped talking to people I didn't know, and I still get anxious when someone seeks me out to get to know me better. My ex exploded with such rage when I established boundaries during our separation and break up that my husband feared for my safety.

I am now on my way home from vacation with the partner that triggered my ex so badly he screamed at me that he wished I would die. The last year has been the best year of my life. My trip was magical, and normally I would be feeling sad it's over, but I honestly just feel so lucky that the best part of it is coming home with me and will be asking for snuggles when I get in bed tonight.

I sent him the link to the comment I saw and told him how much I appreciate how he shows me every day how much he likes and loves me. He tells me every day that I am amazing, incredible, impressive. I am finally starting to believe him. I am in love with who I am because of the confidence I have now that I'm not being corrected with anger or surly behavior whenever I do something too independent. I could write novels about the dysfunction I didn't recognize until I was free from it.

Ladies! Stop dating men who don't like you! The right person (or people!) to allow the privilege of sharing your life with will make it blindingly obvious that they see that you are valuable and desirable. You deserve to be loved, to be with someone you find attractive, who is a good, supportive partner in your life, and who brings out the best version of you.

1708400135.0,UTI (frequent) Recommendations? Experiences?," BACKGROUND: 27F. So, most of my friends and family have maybe had one UTI in their life if one at all. I have gotten them frequently over past few years (4-5 last year). I don't even always have symptoms. Like I don't really have the burning and I have only had pain when I have waited a long time to do something about it. (I am in U.S. and I don't have insurance so I can't always afford to go to the doctor). I use the AZO test strips every couple of months just to check. I always test positive for Leuokocytes, but only on occasion the Nitrites (if it is positive it is VERY light). I am afraid that I have had so many that it has caused damage. I generally drink an ungodly amount of water everyday, and I urinate often). Well... I always struggle to pee. I considered that maybe it was shy bladder bc I have to REALLY focus to relax and pee. ALWAYS like that. It is worse if I drink anything other than water or soda water.

ALL THAT SAID. What can I do to help this and reduce occurrence? I drink lots of water, pee when I need to pee, pee after sex, avoid sodas (RARELY drink one), I don't drink alcohol, and avoid sugary stuff. It is not normal to have this many in a lifetime and I am afraid that due to not seeking healthcare more than once when I should have has damaged something. What else can I be doing to help this?

I just tested positive on an AZO strip today. Strip was Deep purple positive for leuokocytes and barely visible pink for nitrites. When I bought the strips I also bought some AZO Urinary Tract Defence Antibacterial Protection, but I have never taken that before. Anyone have any experience with that?

1708399192.0,Partner doesn‚Äôt have the same idea of cleanliness as I do and Idk how to approach this conversation.,"Okay so I‚Äôm prefacing this to say, my partner is wonderful and I know he will step up if I have this conversation with him. I just don‚Äôt know how to approach this and also don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being unreasonable. 

For context, we don‚Äôt have any children and we live with another roommate. My roommate and I are both pretty clean so house cleanliness has never really been an issue. AFAIK, he hasn‚Äôt done *much* to help clean. Me and my roommate do most of it - vacuuming, floors, bathrooms, all that stuff. 

Tbh, it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much (should it though? lol) because at least I‚Äôm not cleaning all on my own. However, my roommate is moving out soon and I‚Äôm definitely going to have a conversation about expectations and cleaning with him. I know he‚Äôs willing to do it if I ask, however, his idea of what ‚Äúclean‚Äù is far from mine. 

Just to give a bit of background, he basically has the basement to himself and it‚Äôs been agreed upon that he takes care of the basement. He:

- Has not vacuumed the carpet there in 5-6 months (tbf it‚Äôs not that gross looking but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs stuff embedded in the carpet that I don‚Äôt even want to KNOW about atp)

- Does not the clean the bathroom - beard shavings are left in and around the sink, toilet had brown stains on the bottom, no mopping was done

- Did not clean his shower for months. I had to start using it recently so I was the one who did a deep clean cause there was dirt and mold accumulating in the corners

The issue is that this doesn‚Äôt bother him. I‚Äôm the only one who finds it revolting. Am I the one with standards that are too high? I would ideally want carpets, bathrooms, floors cleaned once a week and shower maybe once a month to avoid mold buildup. Having shavings wiped off right after shaves would be ideal. Then other things like, cleaning out the fridge, dishwasher, and freezer I‚Äôd like to have done every few months (or however often these should be cleaned). 

Is this unreasonable? He doesn‚Äôt have a problem with it so shouldn‚Äôt I be the one cleaning to that extent? I‚Äôm just really confused here and don‚Äôt know how to have this conversation. Apologies if anything similar has been asked in this sub before ü•≤

Edit: I also forgot to mention one thing I wanted to address: I don‚Äôt want to fall into a loop of having to TELL him what needs to be cleaned since that‚Äôs just too much mental work and gymnastics for me. Thats something that I‚Äôm not sure is a reasonable ask. Like, if he doesn‚Äôt think something is dirty, how does he know to clean it? If that makes sense? Won‚Äôt he need someone to tell him to clean it? Sorry I‚Äôm just venting now!!!",TwoXChromosomes

Because of my age (then I was 21 at the time), I was told to just come back next year for my annual pap. I remained clear until 2012 when my results came back abnormal again while I was pregnant, I had a colposcopy done, and then another one after my daughter was born. Those results were not so worrisome, and again I was okay until 2016 when I got pregnant with my second daughter. Those results came back positive for HPV 16/18, colposcopy revealed CIN III, and I had a LEEP procedure in early 2017. 

Late 2017, I moved out of state and found an obgyn I love. I told her my history, and since I had gotten my tubes tied directly after the birth of my second daughter, my obgyn suggested a hysterectomy. I had my hysterectomy in May of 2018 and clear paps since then. 

Except this year. I tested negative for 16/18, but positive for other high risk strains. I feel, I don‚Äôt know. Crushed. I knew this was a possibility, but was hopefully since I had been clear for 5 years. I haven‚Äôt spoken with my doctor yet, I saw the results before she did so I have time to freak out about it before I hear from her üòÖ 

Has anyone else been through this? I feel like my hysterectomy was for nothing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love not having a period. This just really sucks. I‚Äôm trying not to cry, but that‚Äôs pretty much all I want to do. üòû",TwoXChromosomes
1708380991.0,Breaking up with my boyfriend finally opened my eyes as to how toxic our relationship was.,"I‚Äôm the type of person to try so hard to make a relationship work, to compromise on so many things so my partner could be happy, sometimes at the expense of my own happiness. I have anxious attachment style. I overthink, over analyze, become co-dependent, dependent on him for my happiness, difficulty setting boundaries. You name it, I experienced it with my ex. I ignored red flags and always justified certain behaviors because he still wanted to be with me at the end of the day. And I was so attached to him, I should‚Äôve paid attention to how he made me feel rather than how I felt about him. 

I thought about the breakup for at least 2-3 months but finally had the courage to do it 3 days ago. In the 2 years we were dating, he never made me feel special, never did anything nice for me. My birthday was back in September. And his idea of a birthday gift was meeting me at midnight, having sex with me for an hour and leaving. No gift, not even a card. When I told him how it made me feel, he called me materialistic. I became scared to tell him how I felt about certain things because he would automatically get defensive. He never stopped to think why I said what I said. As if my feelings were wrong. We were LD for a year and we would barely talk. I would constantly beg him for mere scraps of communication, a 5 minute phone call or FT but he never worked with me. Instead he said I have trust issues, and that was the reason why I would want to FT him. 

I told him he‚Äôs not the only one who‚Äôs making sacrifices (he moved away to a different state for work) by being far away. And he always loved to remind me of all the sacrifices he made for me in the past. As if it was some sort of competition. 2 months ago, he told me that I need to lose weight. I weighed exactly the same from the first day we met. He tried to gaslight me about my own weight and make it seem like I got bigger. 

The final straw for me was when he lost his job 4 weeks ago and barely said a word to me. He has a really bad habit of shutting down when life gets tough. I told him I want to support you and be there for you but also understand if you need your space. He saw my message and didn‚Äôt say a word to me for 10 days, and it was only because I messaged him. After that, we talked for a few more days and again, he stopped talking to me for another week. Until he reached out asking me if he wants to meet up. I was stupid enough to say yes. And when we did, he seemed completely normal. We talked for a little bit then had sex and he went home. I felt so used. He barely says a word to me during this time then comes to have sex. Again, I brought it up to him and his response was ‚Äúwell I never made you do anything‚Äù and I know he didn‚Äôt, but what bothers me is he barely said a word to me for almost a month. Every single time I tried to talk to him about something that was bothering me, his default response would be ‚Äúyou just need to learn to control your emotions‚Äù. And this would usually be about how much he sucks at communicating. Like I was just asking for too much for him to effectively communicate with me.

I know I made the right decision to end things, but damn it still hurts. I‚Äôm trying to remind myself of all the bad stuff. I‚Äôm not perfect either, there were definitely things I could have worked on, but I always took accountability for my actions. And tried my best to work on those issues. I even started therapy. But, he was never able to do the same.",TwoXChromosomes
1708380907.0,Am I awful?,"My (40s, F) spouse (50s, M) and I have an arrangement where we do the common laundry (towels and sheets) every other weekend. If I do it one weekend, he does it the next and back and forth and so on. This has been going on for probably a decade. 

Sunday afternoon of his weekend rolls around and there is no indication that he's doing anything. Around mid-afternoon I say as kindly as I can, ""Maybe you forgot, but it's your weekend to do the towels."" He apologized and hopped right on it. I thanked him and that was that. 

Later that evening he was scrolling on his phone and I said, ""I would like for you to put away your laundry tonight. The basket is blocking the door to the laundry room and it's in the way."" He snapped and said, ""God, you're awful! You have already been nagging me and now you are all over my f*cking *ss about it."" 

I asked how I was nagging him and he responded by mocking me for asking him to do the laundry earlier that afternoon. He used a nasal, singsong voice and made faces at me as if I had asked him rudely and repeatedly. I then proceeded to say that I knew he had a busy week ahead and that I am tired of seeing him leave laundry out sometimes until the following weekend. He said that I was being a pain in the ass and then told me to just shut up. 

Maybe I misread the situation, but I don't think I did anything wrong. I would love to know if I did, but he didn't seem to want a serious conversation. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. My family thinks he's great and basically all of my friends are his, too. It's hardly the first time he's been like this, but this incident really has me off my foundation. Thanks for reading.",TwoXChromosomes
1708380213.0,Positive IUD Insertion Experience!,"I (23F) wanted to share a positive experience I had getting my IUD inserted. I don‚Äôt want to undermine other people‚Äôs negative, painful experiences, but I wanted to share that it was not as bad as I was expecting. 

I decided to get an IUD after being on birth control pill for 7 years. I went to the doctor for my consultation and expressed my desire for something low(er) hormone, so we decided on the Kyleena IUD. I expressed my very low pain tolerance and fear of pain management. She said she could offer a few different options (including a cervical nerve block or complete sedation), but ultimately I just took 1000mg of Tylenol, 800mg of Advil, and an anxiety pill 1 hour before the procedure. 

When I got to the procedure, I again expressed my nervousness and said if I can‚Äôt do it we will just have to stop. I asked the doctor to explain everything that she was doing verbally. She inserted the speculum, sanitized (?) my cervix, clamped my cervix, inserted the measuring tool, and inserted and opened the IUD. Then, she removed everything. 

The only two parts that hurt at all were the insertion of the measuring tool and the insertion of the IUD, and they were both like 3/10 on the pain scale. Everything else was fine. It felt more uncomfortable than anything ‚Äî they‚Äôre going into a sensitive area and a lot of nerves that haven‚Äôt been touched at all before are being poked at, almost like getting poked REALLY hard in your belly button. That made me feel nauseous and I got sweaty, which lasted until about 2 minutes after the procedure. I had very mild cramping feelings. I was given a juice box and was on my way!

I‚Äôm about 2 hours post-procedure now and feel pretty normal. I‚Äôm expecting to get worse cramping for the next few days. 

For me, the negative experiences that I read that people have shared about their insertion experience made me very very nervous to do this (so much so I was a click away from canceling my appointment last night lol).

1708375632.0,How do we reduce the burden of beauty standards?,"Sorry for my english, not a native speaker. Looking for a discussion/other opinions :)

Got me thinking after I saw this comment + the replier attacking every woman who had the slightest anti-consumerist/makeup opinion: [https://imgur.com/a/NYFSw2b](https://imgur.com/a/NYFSw2b)

When I was a teen, I had a ""not like other girls"" phase, mostly because girls were portrayed as shallow, unreasonable, annoying (for men/husbands), and sexualized caricatures everywhere. I think a lot of girls couldn't/didn't want to relate to that reduced image of themselves and had some misplaced hatred. I grew up in a DISGUSTINGLY sexist society + family, and that propelled me towards passionate feminism, intersectionality, and other societal issues that plague us both directly and behind the shadows.

Lately, I've been thinking more and more about the role women play in creating/upholding beauty standards. I guess I'm a bit late to the party?

I understand choice feminism to the degree where the choices are purely individual (to whatever capacity human nature allows). Beauty standards however are a bit of a hedgy topic for me. Yes, being objectively beautiful has societal benefits. Of course, anyone who decides to get work done isn't inherently a bad person or anything and this post isn't an attack. But to what extent do we chase these benefits? Women are conditioned to place more value on their appearance and mannerisms to seem desirable, \~93% of all cosmetic surgeries are undergone by women; but to a 19 Y/O me a few years ago, it seemed that the more we welcomed body positivity/dismantled those expectations, the more we should've strayed away from invasive surgeries (\*disclaimer at bottom) and increased representation of all features.

However, I believe we've taken a turn for the worse. I've seen so many influencers remove their minutely hooked nose to the template Instagram nose. Template Instagram lips. Template Instagram boobs. Removed a small beauty mark. Buccal fat. Parental pressure to get surgery in Asian households, not to mention the general beauty epidemic. Istg, the smallest of things. Body dysmorphia is ofc an issue, but what is the chain of causality, and are we okay being told: ""Why to learn to love yourself when you can fix it with money""? Heck, I've seen cosmetic labia surgery ads to make them look like Barbie crotches. At that point, we're not even chasing the epitome of natural beauty? And not to mention, the thriving $500bn makeup business is patronised disproportionately by women still. Add to that the age-old narrative of shaving, fair armpits, and youthism... however keeping in mind the difference between external grooming and internal structural modifications, I fear the normalisation and commonplace-hood of the latter poses a far bigger issue women seem to ignore with an ""it is my choice, it doesn't impact anyone else"" - but imo, it kinda does? Someday if it became a trend to bleach a-holes (as if p\*rn wasn't doing enough damage) it would eventually become a meme, a part of 'girlhood', and indirectly become another commonplace beauty standard. In the age of social media's fast-paced trends and sheer quantity, it doesn't take a lot to sway/influence people.

&#x200B;

In my head, purely ""aesthetic surgery"" choices don't exist in a vacuum. Every girl gets the clear message behind it. Insecurity is instilled, and girls are encouraged to roll over and give in and change every small thing they're taught is ugly, instead of creating a culture where surgery gets neither praise/encouragement or shame. Yes, influencers can be transparent over social media, but they can't carry a signboard saying ""I used to have hipdips! My lips aren't naturally wrinkle-less!"" Naturally, the erasure of certain features to replace them with ""prettier features"" over and over again creates a clear narrative that leads even more women to change themselves. In the end, we play into the same patriarchal standards in the name of empowerment.

""If you're broke, just say it"" - is beauty another thing we're relegating to the rich?

""Makeup/Procedures are one of the best things about being a girl!"" - Have we reclaimed this after eons of beauty standard imposition in an act of empowerment, or have we just become successfully indoctrinated?

To note: Makeup as a form of art, confidence, and enhancement is not something I'd ever want taken away from us. It's more about the glamourizing consumerist culture surrounding it.

Lastly, I've seen the recent surge of the Pick-Me Police that calls every woman a ""pick me"" for speaking against unattainable beauty standards, women's participation in patriarchal trends and not being yes-men jumping with supportive celebration at everything women do.

How are we going to watch and celebrate the goal post for beauty shift farther and farther while simultaneously preaching ""love yourself girlies!!"" to youngins without cheapening the sentiment? How do we end a cycle of falling prey to the standards? Is something like that even possible? Or in the end, is it just a game of who does it best and survives?

\*(I'm obv not referring to medically/functionally necessary cosmetic surgeries like botox for headaches, breast reductions, skin removal, etc. as I've seen people bring these up to eventually derail conversations. And if someone was born with features so sharp and unique that it deviates from the ""norm"" to the point where it affects their mental health, by all means, use medical science!)

My boyfriend and I have been dating for over a year now. I moved in with him in August. Our relationship had a pretty unconventional start. I was living with an abusive ex(looking back I should‚Äôve moved out, but he threatened to k*ll himself every time I tried). My ex and I‚Äôs relationship was over long before I moved out. My current boyfriend was living with his mom when we met so we didn‚Äôt really have anywhere to go. We‚Äôd meet and have dates a couple times a week. Things were good and we had fun. Although I had just ended a relationship a few months prior, I knew what I wanted, and I didn‚Äôt want something casual, and he knew that. I thought we were on the same page. Christmas came, and I went to his house and met his family. He told me he loved me that night when I stayed with him. So I thought things were getting serious. He showed me that he wanted me around, and that he really cared for me. We‚Äôd never talked about ‚Äúlabels‚Äù until Christmas when he was introducing me to people. He called me his girlfriend, and said our anniversary should be the night of our first date, which was a couple months before this. I thought it was sweet. 

When we were just going out on dates, he‚Äôd tell me things like how ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù it felt to be with me. I felt the same, and I thought he meant that in a way like we‚Äôd met before. Like being someone he met that he was almost immediately comfortable with. Now I know he meant that I felt familiar to his ex. 

Looking back now, I realized he‚Äôd make certain comments about his ex. He‚Äôd tell me stories about her and their time together. He told me a very intimate detail about something he did for her. If there was something I was uncomfortable doing in front of him, he‚Äôd always say something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in a 3 year relationship, it‚Äôs ok‚Äù. Once when we were laying in bed cuddling, he told me about how the bed him and his ex shared sunk in the middle and pushed them together. All of the things I knew about her I learned unwillingly and I never once asked about her. 

Last summer I found out a lot of things he‚Äôd lied about. He told me that he went home for Christmas for a month, and decided he didn‚Äôt want to spend his life without her so he was going to propose. When he got back she cheated and broke up with him. He said he went no contact with her and didn‚Äôt talk to her until she randomly showed up at his apartment on his birthday almost a year later. But I found out they talked on and off that whole summer and had a friends with benefits relationship. She ended up wanting to get back together and he didn‚Äôt want to. He said he wanted to hurt her like she did him. 

I couldn‚Äôt understand why he lied, because I‚Äôd told him about my past mistakes. He couldn‚Äôt understand why I was upset, because he said it was none of my business.  Ever since this happened , I‚Äôve felt extremely insecure, jealous, inferior, and not like myself at all. I have never ever felt this insecure in a relationship. I hate feeling like this all the time. If I bring it up, he gets angry. He‚Äôs trying to be better, but he still gets defensive, and then I try to pry more. I just have this gut feeling now that he would be with her if he could (she lives across the country and didn‚Äôt want to move here where we live now). 

He also told me that when we met, he just wanted something casual and didn‚Äôt realize he wanted something serious until I stopped coming around as much after starting a new job. This was after I went to his family‚Äôs for Christmas. 

I just feel crazy and I don‚Äôt want to lose something that means so much to me. But I hate the idea that I don‚Äôt mean as much to him, or as much as his ex meant to him.  And it‚Äôs not even just the fear of him leaving me for her if she decided to move here, it‚Äôs even just the thought that he‚Äôd prefer to be here with her over me. I‚Äôm hurting so much and don‚Äôt know how to think about this in a healthy way or in a way that won‚Äôt keep hurting our relationship.

1708366050.0,How often do you get UTIs?,"I was feeling kinda weird today during this morning's pee and I'm worried I've gotten another UTI. I always use GoodRX to get my antibiotics prescribed because it's only $40 and it's much faster and easier than going to the doctor despite the fact I have insurance and all that.

I thought this seems to be happening pretty frequently I should check. Between GoodRX payments and CVS prescription history, it seems this would be the 6th infection within the last year. That feels like a lot and is very concerning.

I don't get very severe or painful symptoms like some that I've read here. It's mainly just a weird feeling when peeing, like metallic if that makes sense. As well as feeling like I need to go often and then not peeing much but that happens to me every night when I'm trying to go to bed. I'll get up like 3 times because any urge keeps me from being able to fall asleep and then I'll wake up super early having to pee.

I don't do a lot of the high risk for infection things. I don't wipe back to front, don't wear thongs, don't take baths, don't wear sweaty clothes for long, etc. I've been with my current bf over 2 years and he has generally good hygiene (doesn't have long nails) but it's very spur of the moment sex so it would feel weird to stop and ask him to like wash his hands first?

I try my best to pee every time after (can't before or I won't have any pee left for after). My worst habit tho is I definitely don't drink enough water. I'm talking probably half a liter a day. Unless sparkling water counts I have average one can of those a day. Sometimes half a bottle of powerade a day.

I don't have this issue when sex hasn't happened tho so I think it could be related to not specifically preparing before sex with hand washing and not peeing soon enough or just not enough volume post sex.

I did read another woman's experience of going to a urologist and they found she was reinfecting so often because she had an antibiotic resistant bacteria so the issue was never actually resolved. Is it worth the time and money it'd take to go to a specialist when I never even have serious symptoms? I've literally never had any body aches or pains or trouble sleeping due to a UTI or peeing blood and other troubling symptoms I've read other women deal with. I know you're not doctors but I'd appreciate hearing about your experiences. Thank you.

-meeting someone in uni bulding- haha, good joke. People talk to people from their classes, don't want to talk to random people on corridor. And to be honest i understand that, what can you say to a stranger?

I (25F) have been dealing with excessive vaginal wetness (discharge) for a couple of years now. It is literally ruining my relationship and life. I do not feel anything while being intimate with my partner, and he is not feeling anything because i‚Äôm too wet and so there is not friction.

I had bv and ureaplasma and thought that those might be causing this discharge. However, after treatment and testing negative this problem of too much wetness still remains, especially when aroused.
I do not have any STD or bv or yeast. My gyno said i‚Äôm healthy and some women just produce a lot. However, it is ruining my mental health and my desire to have sex since I know both of us won‚Äôt feel anything and we quickly stop. 

I have tried many things such as boric acid, antihestamines and also wiping during intercourse but nothing helps üòî

The comments were a cesspool. So many men were saying that testosterone makes every man feel like a wild animal and it gives them primal urges that they can‚Äôt resist or control.

They kept citing actual studies and mentioning how many FTM transitioners said that taking testosterone made them feel like slaves to their hormones and they quickly began sexualizing women constantly, even when fully clothed. (This could be transphobia though, please correct me).

There were arguments that women should be understanding of men‚Äôs nature and that we torture them by saying no to sex because of their hormones. Many commenters also stated that we are privileged as women and should stop being so selective with mates and just give them what they want so they don‚Äôt suffer.

I feel so broken and sad, I cried reading the entire comment section. I feel hopeless because a part of me worries that they could be right. If they‚Äôre right and T does make them that way then why are we even fighting it?

Everywhere in the world throughout history women have been murdered, raped, and bullied out of male dominated spaces. Nowhere ever feels safe. So what if sexism is just natural?

I realise this post might not reflect everyone's experience and want to apologise in advance if it's misguided or over the top; advice is always welcome though!

Although I'm quite happy now, it's scary to have to navigate womanhood from zero knowledge as an adult. What has hit me the most is the always present and crushing pressure to always look 'presentable'. I always thought if I just aimed to look 'neat' I wouldn't have to put in too much effort. But I was wrong.

My very basic skincare routine of face wash and moisturizer quickly developed into a full blown treatment every evening. I want to get rid of every wrinkle, every visible pore, every spot and kept adding more products. Sometimes I'm clear enough to know that imperfections are normal, but I quickly forget about it.

I feel so much less than all of the other women in my life when it comes to fashion. I'm still learning, but I also have a wardrobe I need to overhaul completely. And that's crazy expensive, much more so than the clothes my mom bought for me until 3 years ago. Having to often wear my old clothes whilst others have found their own style is depressing.

I also was often very close to developping an ED after seeing a number I didn't like on the scale. I was extremely skinny at one point, just after I started hormone therapy, but I felt as fat as a cow. I still do, but my weight is a bit higher now. I even often get complimented how lucky I am for being as skinny as I am, but I just don't see it, I don't believe it. Because I see models, and even friends, who are so perfectly skinny, yet perfectly curved.

For someone who has always had a bit of an unhealthy habit to link my self image to what others think of me, being a woman is stressful. And it's all so ~~invisible~~, but the pressure, the judgement, it seems to be present everywhere.



Edit: I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able to get to all of the replies, but the comments have been fantastic, supportive, eye-opening... Just thank you already for this! It's become pretty clear to me that I still have an unhealthy idea of what I'm supposed to do, te wear, to think. I can't let others dictate who I am.

Edit 2: Some people seem to stumble over me using the word 'invisible' to describe the pressure I have felt. I meant this as being invisible to those who aren't aware of it. It's implicitly present in all interactions, but was almost never outright spoken about to me. I missed it. That's why it was invisible. Now it's not anymore.

Edit 3: I'm going to have to be clear here. The title may not have conveyed my message well to some people. Most people read the entire post and have been able to understand from the entire post. But I agree that the pressure is not invisible or subtle per se, or that I was completely unaware. Rather I think I could only see a fringe of the actual problem. I lacked the lived experience I do now. I think that may have confused some people in the comments.",TwoXChromosomes

1708340458.0,Experience in High school,"Wanted to say public high school is an awful experience for everyone and there is no excuse that adults won‚Äôt take to be awful but I digress!

My personal experiences in high school have been tough to put in words. They made me a self-hating individual, as most teens go through. And my interest in sociology and knowing what my teachers were saying at the time, made me very angry with the school. 

Anyways, here are my experiences, is this normal for other women or is it just me?
- Biology teacher called women baby makers and inferior to men in every way. Whole class was so silent.
- Had a male student go on a rant about how women deserve to be in the kitchen. 
- Had an English teacher ask almost every male student in class if women deserved rights. They all said yes. What is the point of doing this in class? For minority groups or anything, genuine question because I don‚Äôt understand this exercise. 

By the way. I liked both teachers. We all talk a lot and they both had high (?) opinions of me at the time so they would probably be surprised I still remember these experiences and harbored a lot of ill will because of it‚Ä¶
Although I know it wasn‚Äôt a reflection on my teachers, (they all had wives and/or a daughter), after that I couldn‚Äôt help notice how the crucible book we read was sexist‚Ä¶etc,. Basically the hurt permeated me for part of my school life and I couldn‚Äôt help but stare, mistifyed and hurt at this part of society. 
I bet this is not such a different experience from men who are hurt at being told to man up and all that‚Ä¶ 

The reason I wanted to speak on it was because it was 1) cathartic, 2) My twitter is currently stuck in red-pilled men hell and I see a lot of men talk about their experiences on twitter a lot, so I thought why not share my experience as a woman? Separately, because that‚Äôs a scary group of people haha‚Ä¶

From my understanding both genders need to find ways in which to defeat the anger that comes from these experiences, and that‚Äôs is important and vital, for anyone. 

I don‚Äôt blame people for succumbing to the anger and loneliness but it is a cycle and will run you over like a four-wheeler. 

I wanted to speak on this just because I haven‚Äôt found anyone making a point on this and how much it can make girls hate themselves and their gender. I know sexism is prevalent and probably better left unsaid but hearing the stories of individuals is important to anyone who is feeling isolated, especially teenagers. 

I think online is a special way to do this, while teens are out there being loud and rude and other stuff with their friends, having fun, sometimes they‚Äôre comes a point where it all builds up for them and the internet is a solution for that, although it‚Äôs not perfect. For anyone who hates themselves, I know therapy is an option, as a child who would become more self-conscious because of it, I did not take it.

I think some pieces of advice that helped me are due so. Remember that sexism is never your fault. It‚Äôs unjust and prejudiced, it would never be because of you. It is an idea of you that someone made up in their head to serve their point. This goes for both genders and I truly believe that no one is better than the other.

I wish someone would have told me they had the same experience, so I wouldn‚Äôt feel alone or crazy, but hey the internet is here, now you can find out even more about how people screw each other over all the time, haha.

I don‚Äôt remember if all of this happened in one evening or if I came back to hang out with him a different evening.

1708324485.0,The Men on This Abortion Documentary,"Guys I just watched an abortion documentary and some of the people on this... 

So there was a woman who had an abortion some years prior to the filming, and she was explaining that at that time she was poor, living in a trailer, no healthcare, and her boyfriend and she had a combined monthly income of like $1-1.5k and so she decided to abort. But then the boyfriend quips ""We could have made it work if we tried"". I'm sorry what? Sir do you have any idea how much a stroller, carseat, formula, diapers, etc costs? And you think you could have made it work? And if it didn't work, would you have just walked away because you could? 

Do men think about anything? Do they put any thought into anything regarding children or are they just here for the ride?

And then there was this extreme pro-lifer who was told by her father that she was almost aborted, and she went on and on about how happy she was that she was born, as if there is a room somewhere full of aborted fetuses as adults lamenting about how much it sucks that they were never born. Like they know exactly what they missed out on and they're mad about it somehow.

I just can't wrap my head around these people. And the pro-lifers with their van screeching about adoption. Do these people know how hard it is to adopt a kid? It's not like the movies where you just pop on down to your local orphanage and take your pick. Add another baby to the inventory as if there aren't more than enough languishing in the system already.

Another thing I noted was the majority of these pro-life protesters are men. And they bring their toddlers to the rally or whatever like they're proving some kind of point? The only point I see is that you need to get yourself a job, sir, because you are here every day.

1708317967.0,Is it worth going back to the doctor over painful sex/periods?,"I have a suspicion there‚Äôs something wrong with my uterus. For reference I‚Äôm away to turn 20.

So it all started when I was about 10/11ish, my period pains were horrific. Like couldn‚Äôt function, couldn‚Äôt go to school, painkillers didn‚Äôt help, I‚Äôd be woken up at like 2am by severe cramping and just cry for hours until I could go back to sleep.

I got put on birth control when I was 12/13 so I just started skipping my periods.

I lost my virginity at 12/13 but didn‚Äôt really have penetrative sex. 

Then I got with my current partner when we were 15 years old. Sex was/is painful for me. After dealing with painful sex for a year or two I went to the GP twice, first time they just did an examination with their fingers, couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong, I had an ultrasound, again couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong, they concluded the pain was psychological, which kinda made sense because I do have some sexual trauma and had a problem with people pleasing so struggled to say no to my partner (for reference they NEVER pressured me and when they realised I had basically been lying to them they were upset and felt guilty, he became very careful in making sure I felt comfortable). I started therapy, I started reading up a lot on sex and reclaiming my sexuality, I read books, listened to podcasts, practiced mindful sex/masturbation, became super over-communicative during before and after sex. The lot of it. Was still experiencing pain, got another finger examination by the GP and again they couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong, after that they didn‚Äôt offer any further help. 

About 6months ago because I wanted to stop taking birth control pills, so I switched to an IUD. 

The GP doing the IUD insertion was quite dismissive of me when I tried to explain my issues with pain and said those wouldn‚Äôt matter. Then she proceeded to fail to get the IUD in, the whole experience was very painful.

So I got referred to a gynaecologist to do the insertion, she was much nicer, it took THIRTY minutes for her to get the IUD in. She had to pull out all the stops, she injected me with anaesthetic, she had to go up to the biggest dilator she had, yadda yadda, she said it was one of the most difficult IUD insertions she‚Äôs ever done. She actually almost gave up.

So, over the years I‚Äôve done a lot of the healing work around sex listed above and can 100% say I feel comfortable/enjoy sex now, I manage to get wet, I‚Äôm present, I know what I like and I trust my partner, but it still hurts, not the whole time now, but I find myself having to stop a lot because it begins to hurt. 

Also, it took awhile but after having my IUD inserted I just had my first period. And oh my god. It was PAINFUL. The first day I couldn‚Äôt move. There was stuff I wanted to get done and I just couldn‚Äôt. I just laid there on the sofa in pain for hours. I tried to sleep but really struggled to. I took 500mg of ibuprofen every 4 hours and it did nothing, the heat pad didn‚Äôt make much difference either. And also, when I was 10/11 I remember my period pain being severe but it‚Äôd come and go, this pain just lasted all day. There was no relief. 

The second day was similar, just stuck suffering on the sofa. It did ease up in the evening a bit but I still couldn‚Äôt get much done. I like to cook tea but I just opted for a microwave meal because it‚Äôs all I wanted to eat. Same story with the painkillers. 

Third day (which is today) has felt more normal. The morning still really hurt and I had a banging headache, but later it eased up. I still had a couple moments where I had to go lie down tho, but I was able to get a couple things done. Painkillers also seemed to be working better. 

Also I imagine this is normal but I‚Äôm REALLY fkn gassy, like I cannot stop farting and my poops have been sticky asf. 

Idk, should I got back to the doctor even though they‚Äôve never been able to find anything? I would like to try to get referred to a gynaecologist again but it can be a bit difficult with the NHS. I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs maybe a way I can skip the GP and contact the sexual health clinic directly. Is there anything specific I should ask them to check for?

One ongoing conflict of our relationship is that I felt his jokes would be lowkey mean a lot of the time. I‚Äôm of the opinion ‚Äúall jokes have some truth‚Äù while my ex felt differently, apparently 

There would be so many times I would get offended at a joke of his that I perceived as mean/snarky and he would be like ‚Äúwhy are you taking it so seriously, relax, stop getting offended obviously I am just joking‚Äù I am more on the sensitive side but I do have a good sense of humour.

The last straw was our fight yesterday. We are currently 3 hours long distance bc he moved away for work and only see each other once every couple weeks. I wanted to spend the day with him when he came back into town and I dressed in a black top, oversized knit cardigan, jeans and white sneakers. It was a cute fit but casual.  My style tends to be more on the casual side rather than dressed up.

We were walking down the street and he pointed to a clothing store and was like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get you a new outfit you dress like a bum‚Äù I got upset at this and was like ‚Äúyou know what never mind at this let‚Äôs go home‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to spend time with him anymore. He got annoyed and I said to him ‚Äúwhat, was that a joke too?‚Äù, he was like ‚Äúno I‚Äôm serious babe‚Äù. I got even more upset.

I insisted that he take me back and we drove back to his place in wordless silence. When I got back I took my things and told him I would be going home (I drove to his place). He was like ‚Äúyou can never take a fucking joke, I‚Äôm sick of your shit you‚Äôre fucking dumb if you thought I was serious‚Äù I reminded him that he said he was serious about me dressing like a bum. He then was like ‚ÄúI was being sarcastic you‚Äôre fucking annoying, I just wanted to do something nice for you by getting you some new clothes‚Äù ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt value me coming all the way here to see you‚Äù ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just talk formal all the time if it bothers you so much then, you can‚Äôt take a joke‚Äù. I got upset and I started crying (I tend to cry easily, unfortunately) and he was like ‚Äúhere we go, get some control over your emotions‚Äù. I told him he was being rude as hell.

He must have felt apologetic or something because he wanted to cuddle after all this but I knew I was done with him. I could literally feel my love for him start to go away. He‚Äôs hurt me far too many times.

Today I spoke to him before he went back home and told him that I don‚Äôt see us working out long term.

1708315345.0,Readjusting to pill after IUD... plus emotional support for constant bleeding/breakthrough,"I desperately need period advice, I'm bleeding again and I can't handle this.

I've recently had my IUD removed and am re-adjusting to life on Norimin, the former was a nightmare and the latter a dream, but I'm having breakthrough bleeding again and want to know what's smarter: taking an early break to purge my system again (with knowledge that Id be unprotected) or waiting it out.

More details of where I'm at:

Turned 26 in June, have never had children. 

I got a Mirena IUD in June/July because after 5 years on the pill, I was starting to forget if I'd taken it sometimes in a way that deeply concerned me. I was also getting sick of taking it every day. It was otherwise wonderful and perfect for me. 

I bled for 80 days straight until finally clearing up, but then while my periods were lighter they lasted 14 days and I only had 14 days in between periods. This all took a toll on my mental health - not biologically, just the mental drain of constantly being controlled by incessant bleeding. 

After an 18 day period which gave me a morning of spotting two days later, I rushed forward my appointment to get it removed and got a new script for the pill; I got it out in late January when I was on day 4 of Norimin again. Of course, I then bled lightly after a day or two which continued for the 24 days until I reached my first pill break on day 29 of the pill. This was the classic blood bath that I was used to (almost) and purged everything so when I went back to the blue it cleared up and I was free...

Until now, 11 days later and I'm starting to bleed again and I can see that it's going to be the persistent ""will constantly trickle until I can take my day 29 pill break again.""

I now have to contend with withdrawal from the IUD and reacclimatising to the pill and I don't know how to do that.

In the past, I had a good thing going with Norimin where I took it nonstop and only had a pill break if I started getting breakthrough bleeding or if I was late taking a pill (I take it same exact time every day) as both would trigger the ""bleed until you take a break"" (I kept immaculate record of my pill so I was always covered/safe). I also kept it similar to my natural cycle so would only break for 4 days (my natural cycle was very irregular as to when it was, but always lasted 4-5 days and was extremely heavy). 

I repeat my question here: I am only on day 11 of blue pill, do I take a break again (knowing I'm not protected) to hopefully reset it, or do I just have to tough it out until my next break because I need to acclimatise my body to the pill cycle? I know I should probably do the latter but I'm at the end of my rope and at the very least need some help to have the strength to get through the next few months.",TwoXChromosomes

I got my period 5 hours after sex (yay), meaning I was on cycle day 1. But I decided on plan B the morning after to be protected (took on cycle day 2 WHILST I was bleeding). The other 3 times we had sex, the condom was never broken. I‚Äôm on cycle day 37 now, experiencing some cramping, breast soreness, and back aches. I think i‚Äôm pregnant, but haven‚Äôt had time to get a test due to school, work, gym, & sports. My bf believes i‚Äôm completely fine and when I ask for some reassurance or for him to run quick and drop a test off for me while i‚Äôm at work, he just says i‚Äôm not pregnant. 

Please help me out here, i‚Äôm not sure if the period meant I didn‚Äôt get pregnant from the sex instance. I‚Äôm very confused. I will take a test when I have off days this coming weekend because i am able to get them then, just wanna know if i‚Äôm crazy/if the odds are high or low.

Edit: Thank you all for your advice and kindness on my situation. I appreciate it more than ever and it feels nice to have support, even if it‚Äôs from reddit. Feel free to keep any support/advice/knowledge on the chance of pregnancy coming. It‚Äôs greatly appreciated and needed ‚ù§Ô∏è",TwoXChromosomes

I'm married, husband doesn't care to socialize. My friends consist of a couple, that's it. I feel like I'm so isolated. I'm 58, nowhere near dead yet.

I have no idea how to make new friends at this stage. I would love to have someone to go listen to live music with, go to Mardi Gras parades with, do lunch, etc. But I got nothing.

1708305649.0,My( 43F) boyfriend (47M) of over a year left me following a health diagnosis ,"This is my second account. I‚Äôve been long-time lurker, first time poster. I‚Äôm doing so because I need some support and encouragement. This page has been such a valuable resource over the years, so thank you. I have cross posted this to issue-specific subreddits but wanted to get some additional advice from my fellow two X-ers. 

All my health problems (endo and adeno)  started May 2023. My first laparoscopic surgery was in June and I lost my left ovary (with 6 cm endometrioma), left fallopian tube, and my appendix. I was diagnosed at that point with stage 4 endo (DIE) and adeno. The surgeon said it was some of the worst he‚Äôs ever seen. The pictures look like a car crash - dark and awful like lung cancer images. 

I was told I‚Äôd need a hysterectomy a few years down the road. I‚Äôm thankful I had the foresight to freeze my eggs in 2020. 

My gynecologist directed me to use HRT via continuous birth control from the summer to fall. Once that stopped working, I made the decision to fast-track the hysterectomy. That surgery took place as scheduled on 2/6/24, and was a success. They took my uterus, my cervix and my right fallopian tube. I have one ovary left. 

During the lead up time to yeet the Ute, I had the third mammogram of my adult life on  12/29/23. I got the results the week of 1/8/24. Radiology was on top of me getting an appointment to come back in for a 3D mammogram. I did that 1/23/24. I knew the moment I was taken into the closed, fluorescent-lit room that it was cancer. The radiologist stated she was hesitant to jump to a stereotactic biopsy but ordered me to get one. She even said ""we could wait six months."" Thank god I didn't.

The calendar gods afforded me a cancelation at Radiology for a stereotactic biopsy for 1/30/24. Picture a massage table, sans relaxation. My right breast was put in a hole where a doctor inserted a needle to gather 6 specimens. It felt like I was a car getting a painful oil change. They inserted a u-shaped titanium rod so that when they perform surgery they know where to go. My breast looks like a Basquiat painting.... Still!

On February 1st, I was diagnosed with breast cancer stage 1, right side, nuclear 2/3. It looks like a tiny constellation of bright dots. To say I was dumbfounded would be an understatement. Still went through with surgery and all things considered that went successfully. 

I had a meeting with one of the top surgeons in the mid-Atlantic for breast cancer on Thursday 2/15. He ordered a MRI with and without contrast. I‚Äôm awaiting the results. 

On 2/13 I got a message from my (ex) boyfriend of over a year saying this is all too much for him. He can‚Äôt handle it. He needs a break. He‚Äôs ‚Äúnot strong enough‚Äù for this. I‚Äôm just speechless now. Just when you think things can‚Äôt get worse they do. 

He also says one of the things he needs from our relationship is ‚Äúshared experiences.‚Äù I had to stop freelance work when I initially got sick last year and it‚Äôs been slow returning to that world. I have about 5-6 more weeks of recovery from the hysterectomy and at least 5 weeks to manage and treat the breast cancer. 

He‚Äôs picked right now to harp on me about a job. Right now, beating cancer is a full-time job. He says he gets it, but at the same time is relentless about me not working. My parents are helping me and I‚Äôm living off quite a bit of savings. I pay my bills and the condo I live in is paid off. I haven‚Äôt asked for him to be involved with any of my medical issues b/c I know how stressed he is. My family and friends have been there for me. 

I honestly don‚Äôt think I ever want to talk with him again. The one person I thought would stick with me through thick and thin has disappeared. I think it‚Äôs especially frustrating bc I helped him through his divorce and some of his own health issues. He actually used the adage: ‚Äúif you love someone set them free, if they come back to you it‚Äôs meant to be.‚Äù I‚Äôm just at a loss. Did I waste a year of my life? 

I feel like no one will ever want me now - and I can‚Äôt seem to shake that feeling. 

Any support or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.

Okay so my period is usually a duration of 5 days long every time. But I noticed a change last year November 2023 I got my period on the 1st of the month it last it‚Äôs usually 5 days and then stopped as normal. 5 days later it lasted another 5 days and then it stopped again. 
I wrote it off thinking okay periods change sometimes things happen due to stress etc and I did just lose resigned from a job in October and was stressing it a little. 
So not even a full 3 weeks(17 days exactly) later I get my period again.
Now it‚Äôs December my period lasted its usual 5 days then stops as normal. Exactly 2 weeks later (14 days) it starts again. But this time instead of 5 days it changed to 6 which is extremely random and out of norm of me. 
Now it‚Äôs January yet another 2 weeks (14 days) pass I get my period again this time it‚Äôs a normal 5 days. 
Now it‚Äôs February.. 3 weeks later (22 days) I get my period again but this time it‚Äôs totally different.

My entire family is on their pc 24/7, it's all I knew growing up. So I've always gravitated towards guys like this, pc nerds and gamers.

My first relationship (7 yrs, 6 married). The guy wanted to stay inside and either game or watch tv. He never ever wanted to go outside and do something, or experience something new or travel.

My second relationship (3 yrs living together), he spent the entire 3 years invalidating me, calling me a fake IT person (I worked as software developer). Refusing to game with me, and when he did game with me he would rage and shit on me for being bad (at league of legends and wow). Then refuse to game with me again. Basically my dude was gatekeeping being a nerd. I was a fake nerd.

My third relationship, dude keeps gaming until 2-4 am every work day, neglecting our baby and toddler because he's unable to function in the morning.

I'm so fucking done with gamers.

Next time I'm going for a sleek business guy. To think, I turned some down because they seemed too unfamiliar for me. Jeez. I'm never touching another gamer with a 10 foot pole, and anyone interested in PCs will be an instant deal breaker.

EDIT: To clarify some points, because a lot of assumptions are being made, understandably so.

I never said any of the dudes were slobs. The first dude had his shit together. If anything needs doing, he gets up and does it. Bills in the mail? Paid the same evening. Need a dentist appointment? He already called this morning. Tap leaking? He goes to the store the same day and the tap is fixed the next day. He does not know the meaning of the word ""procrastinate"", and if he does he never showed it. But he had absolutely 0 interests outside of his job, house and gaming. He never wanted to go outside and experience anything. Just work his job, take care of the house and game. I was dying of boredom.

Second dude was a real asshole, so no ink necessary, but not a slob either.

Third dude is a certified slob and procrastinator. However, he loves being spontaneous and doing all the fun things together outside the house, trying new foods, travelling and iscovering new places. It was so amazing, all my dreams were coming true, visiting everywhere, doing everything I ever wanted, travelling at the drop of a hat, going to all these amazing restaurants, just being spontaneous. It did bother me initially that he always stays up gaming and never comes to bed with me. I even made a reddit post about it and the consensus was to leave dude be.  Nobody on reddit was bothered that their partner would stay up late and they would go to bed alone. So I made my peace with it. Moreover, you'd think one would adjust their lifestyle when kids arrive. And he did, he got massively better. He went from putting baby in the chair to watch him game to never gaming while the kids are awake. We even made a deal that he would quit lol while the kids are small. However he seems to be experiencing memory loss and swears we never made such a deal, so he's full on relapsing and I'm sick of his shit.

Last point, lots of people seem to be focused on my word choices, ie ""gamer"", ""sleek business guy"" etc. I live in a country with 3 official languages, none of them English. English is one of the 4 languages I'm fluent in. But, apparently, some nuance eludes me still, seeing as lots of people pointed my word choice out.

All of my symptoms align with endometriosis, I've taken many tests (ones made by doctors, requested for me to take by my doctor) where I put all my symptoms and it always says endometriosis.  But there's one symptom that doesnt make sense.  I have CRAZY long cycles, like an average of 50-72 days.  Endometriosis typically has shorter cycles than average.

1708278735.0,Early warning signs of manipulative and/or controlling man?,"I (31f) went on a first date recently with a guy (41m) that I just haven‚Äôt been able to really shake. I‚Äôve talked about it with a friend and with my therapist but curious what others might think. 

Went out with this guy and I thought it went generally well. He was nice and attentive, a little touchy feely but not in a super weird way. He kissed me a few times during the date, which I normally don‚Äôt like on a first date, but I consented. He then was telling me a story, and after, he was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs weird is that my ex believed that story for years,‚Äù and I was like wait so you just told me a lie? It was like he was testing me or something. He also told me about this ‚Äúpersonality test‚Äù he wanted to do with me so he could ‚Äúlearn more about me.‚Äù He did this after I told him about a different date I‚Äôd been on in the past that had done something similar (a different ‚Äúpersonality test‚Äù), and how I thought that was kinda weird. So we do the ‚Äútest‚Äù and it was kinda accurate, but whatever. But then I‚Äôm thinking, he‚Äôs not being reciprocal with that info. He also said he wasn‚Äôt trying to psychoanalyze me, but I said ‚Äú‚Ä¶but you are.‚Äù Keep in mind that he doesn‚Äôt work in the psychology field at all‚Ä¶ I felt oddly charmed by him the whole date and felt like I‚Äôd let my guard down more than I normally would on a first date. I‚Äôd even mentioned at one point how I felt a bit disarmed by him and he said ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôve been told that before.‚Äù That night I agreed I‚Äôd be interested in hanging out again, but upon more reflection I felt super weird about the whole thing. I‚Äôm generally not super comfortable letting my guard down with people for a while and I didn‚Äôt like that I did with him. The whole thing just left me feeling icky. He texted me on Valentine‚Äôs Day and I responded, but nothing beyond that. I ended up unmatching him on the dating app and blocking his number. I don‚Äôt normally do that - I prefer just telling people I‚Äôm no longer interested, but again I was just so icked out I knew I didn‚Äôt want to interact with him. 

Also want to point out that before we even went out, I told him that I might have plans the night he wanted to do something so needed to confirm with friends and would let him know soon. He replied the next day (still several days before the date) to let him know by that night if I could go. I thought that came off as a little demanding but over text obviously harder to read between the lines, and thought he‚Äôs probably just being protective of his time, which I understood. 

But all of these pieces put together make me think he was trying to get in my head or something for nefarious reasons. The word ‚Äúmanipulative‚Äù kept popping into my head. I do tend to overthink things at times, but decided I should go with my gut on this one. I feel bad about ghosting him for sure, but like I said I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable interacting with him any further. 

Edit: he also asked me at one point where the weirdest place is had sex was. After a string of seemingly normal first date questions. That weirded me out a little too. 

Can anyone relate?

1708277896.0,The time my doctor mocked me,"This was about 6 years ago, at the VA. 
Here is a little background info to set the scene. I had labral tears in both hips while I was in the military and had surgery to repair both. I always had painful periods, but hey, who doesn't? 

So, fast forward, I'm out of the military, my hip pain came back on one side mainly, so I go to the VA to get it checked out. I had the MRI, and when it was time to review the results with my ortho Dr, he told me he saw a large amount of cysts on my ovary. He told me I needed to go to my primary to get a referral for OBGYN. 
I go to my primary, I say what happened, and this doctor looked at me with disbelief, saying ""cysts are normal on ovaries, you're supposed to have them."" And I said ""yes, I know, the ortho told me that too, but, he said it looked like I had way more than normal and that's why I need to see a speciallist.""

Well my primary wasn't pleased with that answer, but continued to ask questions. And these didnt seem like, 'oh wow I need to gather more information on my patient,' but rather 'this person is an idiot, let me show them how stupid they are,' type questions. Maybe it was both, but the tone of voice was 'you're a liar and I'm going to prove it.'

 ""Have you ever been diagnosed with PCOS?"" 

""No.""

""Have you ever had a pelvic ultrasound?""

""Yes, when I was a kid, before I ever started my period.""

""You had a pelvic ultrasound as a child?"" In an unbelieving, condescending tone.

""Yeah, I had blood in my urine and they wanted to check my bladder and kidneys."" I'm getting really annoyed with this doctor at this point, like... dude just look at the MRI, you have access to it. Also, what does it hurt you to just give me a referral to an OBGYN? A doctor I need to see yearly anyway???? 

""Were you sexually active as a child?"" Said accusatorily with an air of 'you're such a liar'. I just gaped, wondering whether I should even bring up the childhood trauma. ""Because that's the only reason you would have had a pelvic ultrasound."" 

""I'm telling you I had one so they could look at my kidneys and bladder-""

""It was internal?"" The doctor demanded. 

""...no? It was like a regular ultrasound..."" 

""So you didn't have a pelvic ultrasound, you had an abdomenal ultrasound."" 

At this point I'm done arguing and I just ask for the referral so I can leave. I could not believe this doctor casually and callously threw out the line about being sexually active as a child, not even considering the possibility of trauma. 

I later looked up there there is indeed a difference between a pelvic ultrasound, and an internal pelvic ultrasound a.k.a transvaginal ultrasound. So I was even more angry with this doctor because I knew what I was saying. I even confirmed with my sister, who is a nurse, and who also had the same thing done because we both had blood in our urine, and she said they called it a pelvic (not abdomenal). 

Unfortunately at this time in my life, my mental state was at an all time low and I lacked confidence and motivation... to this day I regret not reporting this doctor. 

Oh yeah. She was a woman.

1708255190.0,Struggling with the verdict,"TW: SA

I've tried to put this into words a few times. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, I think it's support. 

I've been through a really stressful and painful police/court process for the last three and a half years after reporting historic childhood sexual abuse. This system feels really damaging to people wanting to report SA. 

I knew what the statistics were like in getting a conviction in this type of case, so I told myself to not hold out hope of it going anywhere. 

It did get to trial, once ending in a hung jury, which then resulted in a retrial. The second trial was chaotic, took longer, and was somehow even more traumatic that the first. It felt less organised on the prosecution side, and this time it ended in a unanimous not-guilty verdict within two hours. 

I'm left feeling like I've been to hell and there's a part of me that still feels like I'm there even though I'm trying to get back in to a normal routine. I feel like I'm just playing out a part whilst inside I'm really hurting and feeling very vulnerable. I feel destroyed by it, and I'm finding it hard to see the value in what I've done. 

I feel like he got away with it. I feel like he can own the narrative that I made it all up, and that I was delusional and a fantasist. It feels painful. I don't know why I care so much about people believing his words over mine. I really tried to speak up, but it felt like I got ripped apart in there. Being cross examined is like being in a room full of mousetraps with no where to safely step. I feel like they took my experience and turned my words in to weapons to inflict their damage on me.

I've posted in r/Covidlonghaulers too but because I'm looking for successful recovery stories I thought I might have more luck reaching people in a more general sub.

Hey everyone,

I (32, F) got Covid for the first time in October and recovery has been an absolute nightmare.¬†

I've figured out that my symptoms seem to come and go in line with my menstural cycle. Basically, when I get my period I almost feel like my old self again (about 80% better), then about 2 weeks later there is a gradual decline, which hits rock bottom about 4-5 days before my period when I feel like I'm back to square one with symptoms. As soon as I get my period (or even the night before), I start to feel better again and the cycle continues. It's such an infuriatingly frustrating roller coaster. Every time I start feeling better, normality is ripped away from me again.¬†

Symptoms include:

‚Ä¢ Insomnia (waking every hour, minimal REM and deep sleep)

‚Ä¢ Fatigue¬†

‚Ä¢ Shortness of breath

‚Ä¢ Ridiculously high heart rate during 'easy' exercise and poor exercise recovery (pre-covid I was running 20km per week, playing ice hockey, and boxing...now during my Luteal phase a walk up a slight incline can spike my HR over 160bpm).

‚Ä¢ 'Tickly feeling in throat (especially when tired/run down)

‚Ä¢ Mild cough and congestion (again most common in the morning after I've overdone it, especially a few days before period).

* Frequent urination

‚Ä¢ Increased anxiety (although thankfully that has improved immensely since I started taking amytriptaline again last month).

It's actually insane how dependent on my cycle these symptoms are. It's like I have a completely different body during my Follicular phase than I do during Luteal. It's a night and day difference. It's all reflected in my Garmin stats too.¬†

Has anyone here experienced this, and if so, were you able to fix it by by using hormonal birth control to skip your period? Either with the pill, an implant or IUD?¬†

I've actually been wanting to stop my periods for years now because of how they mess with my ADHD meds but I've been putting it off because the one time I tried the pill to treat PCOS it sent my anxiety out of control. That was about 12 years ago though and I only tried one brand.

I'm keen to try this but absolutely terrified of making my anxiety worse. October-mid January was the worst my mental health has ever been (to the point that I was frequently calling in sick to work because I couldn't stop crying and hyperventilating about LC ruining my life etc). I've only just started to feel better now that I'm on anxiety meds again and really reluctant to mess with my hormones now.

I also worry that not having my period might have the opposite effect, taking away my two good weeks and putting me in a perpetual state of long Covid hell that I experience during my Luteal phase... Who knows with hormones...anything could happen right? They say everyone's body is different and you need to experiment with different BC pills but that seems like mental health Russian roulette...Desperate to try but so scared, hoping to hear from people with similar experiences.

1708235450.0,Feeling defensive about romantic relationships? F23,"IDK if any of you girls have experienced this before, but I feel *really* defensive when it comes to relationships. And I've only ever had two boyfriends. It's not necessarily that I feel defensive towards my partner, but even in my much longer single periods I've felt very defensive *about* relationships. Like whenever I see a happy couple, I feel very defensive as though the Universe is shoving something into my face that I'll never have. 

I've found myself to be very distrusting of other women as well, which my inner feminist **hates**. When I was in my last relationship, my (now ex) boyfriend and I went to an art exhibit and he briefly, *very* briefly, struck up conversation with an attendant who happened to look very similar to me. I all of a sudden found myself getting very annoyed by the whole situation. Also, I'm reading *Black Swans* by Eve Babitz right now and it's a beautiful book but I'm disgusted because her mentality represents that of many women who think it's okay to be grimy and immoral enough to unapologetically sleep with other women's boyfriends or husbands. This makes me sound so terrible but I'm so entirely sick of women who just flaunt their sexuality to everyone around them, and they have little to no regard or respect for other women's relationships or feelings. I feel like I'm such a deeply uninteresting, boring woman with no sparkle - especially compared to women like Babitz - and even though I'm single right now I just have this deep-seated fear that a woman with more vibrancy and sparkle will just come in and swoop up my man with zero apology. 

This is so embarrassing to admit, but I needed to write it down somewhere so I'm glad Reddit allows me to be fairly anonymous. Have any of y'all ever felt this way? How can I get rid of it?",TwoXChromosomes

So I‚Äôm in the process of figuring out some things about my relationship recently. 
To quick give a Reddit type description, I‚Äôve been spending a lot of time on emotionalabuse and narcissisticabuse recently. 

So months ago, I‚Äôm not even sure how many months ago, I got home and my boyfriend told me that my vibrator had gotten dirty and he threw it away. 
Obviously I was annoyed, but he told me he didn‚Äôt want me to put something dirty like that inside of me and I thought, that‚Äôs fair I guess. Still annoying he didn‚Äôt talk to me about it, but whatever I guess. 
SO jump to today, months and months later, and I was searching for something in our room. I decided to check this weird box that‚Äôs like an old army box type thing that‚Äôs made out of metal. Inside was my perfectly fine vibrator. 

I‚Äôm just kind of confused. Why would he lie about that and why would he keep it? Maybe he‚Äôs using it himself, but if so, we‚Äôve been pretty dang open with our sexual preferences. Idk any thoughts?

UPDATE: I spoke with him today and he got mad at me because he said that he took it months ago and I shouldn‚Äôt bring up stuff that‚Äôs from that long ago. 

He said that he probably had a perfectly logical reason for taking it and that if the roles were reversed he wouldn‚Äôt be upset like I am. 

He then said that all I was doing was calling him a creep and a liar and that he wants to go lay down in traffic. 

So‚Ä¶that went well. ",TwoXChromosomes

Not even the plus size stores seem to stock proper work pants. They're all fashion or office wear.

My mom and I haven't been very close since I became a teenager. In fact, I moved to a different country in my early twenties partly because I didn't feel close to anyone in my family (my dad passed away while I was in high school). I don't really want to get into why I wasn't comfortable at home. At the end of the day, I know my family loves me and I do love them but spending time with them makes me extremely anxious and I don't enjoy it. My family has a very negative outlook on life and I feel a lot of pressure to make this vacation nice for them, knowing that things won't be good enough no matter what I do.

Still, my husband and I make an effort to visit them about once a year and have an okay time. I know my family is really happy when I visit and I feel a responsibility to hold onto this relationship, partly because I hope that it could maybe get better in the future. This year, my mom agreed to visit us instead, which hasn't happened in about five years. Now my mom and my brother are landing in an hour and I'm just sitting on the couch stressing.

I‚Äôve been having nightmares recently of rape. I have long suspected that a former friend/roommate of mine drugged and had sex with me. 

For a long time I was in denial. Trust is an incredibly blinding thing. This was (I thought) I very close male friend of mine. 

We went out one night (we were also coworkers and were with coworkers) I had a couple drinks (not a lot as I don‚Äôt like the sensation of being drunk and am not a heavy drinker) 

My memory is very patchy but I remember the following details 

- I was somehow highly inebriated 
- I remember ride sharing home with him
- being helped into bed by him

(No memory)

- waking up covered in sweat
- feeling sore
- getting a gnarly UTI a day or so afterward


I completely ignored that fact that I woke up sore because 1. I trusted this person and 2. In my mind I didn‚Äôt have sex/remember/consent to sex so it didn‚Äôt happen. 

This was six years ago. 

This person and I gradually fell out of touch. 

I have this disgusting gut wrenching truth in my gut now that is interfering with my ability to have a normal day. I feel sick. Disgusted. Angry. I have finally admitted it to myself. 

My question is- 

Should I confront this person? Ask for an explanation? Play like I‚Äôm not angry and just want to know what happened?


I‚Äôm struggling with feeling like my assault isn‚Äôt ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù because obviously it was so long ago, and I‚Äôm obviously not looking to press charges. Please do not suggest this in your comment I will not be pursuing what is likely to be a very weak case and Im not looking to retraumatize myself.

It's massively trending pic and everyone is just crawling over themselves to trash her appearance, age and career over it. 

Yes it's important for women and especially young girls to discuss the worrying trend of increasing body dysmorphia, young people getting fillers and impossible beauty standards... But do we need to put down a single woman so viciously in order to do that? 

Didn't she grow up in toxic Hollywood showbiz and was lauded as the most beautiful and desired woman for a long time? Aren't we all aware how ridiculously shallow, age and looks obsessed Hollywood is? Do we not already talk about how the industry victimizes young women and spits them out past a certain age?

She did not decide to get all that work done in a fucking vacuum, can you imagine the pressure someone like her feels especially since she's nearing her 40s? So is it even right for people to rip into her like she's done something super awful? 

These things are front and center in my mind when I see her pics being splashed everywhere on social media, with literally thousands of comments, especially from men, talking about how she's ""old and washed up,"" ""she's not hot like how she used to be,"" ""this is what women do when they age out,"" etc. For fuck sake she's someone who is expected to look young no matter what her biological age is.

For instance one of my coworkers was talked to for showing a small amount of cleavage while wearing a v neck sweater. I had the same amount of skin showing but because I have a smaller chest they didn't say anything. That's also not in the dresscode.

A different coworker is going through menopause and having hot flashes. She has to wear sleeveless tops (not spaghetti straps) they suddenly decided she couldn't anymore due to dresscode. She confronted them on it, that either she smells or she wears the shirts she needs to in order to be comfortable and do her work. They did relent on it.

Recently I've been getting more and more overheated and was wearing a cardigan over my sleeveless dress. I took off my cardigan and one of my least favorite coworkers said something about it being against dresscode. I said, either I show my shoulders or I smell like sweat all day (I can't wear deodorant with aluminum in them since I'm allergic) and she left me alone. 

Anyways, I'm annoyed and ready to fight about it. It's only women getting in trouble while they are ignoring the men that are also violating the dress code. All of the women have started wearing v necks to see if we get coded, specifically those of us with flatter chests.

We work in a office sometimes but it's also a production type environment so it entails a lot of moving around and it gets hot AF in the summer. But no shorts are allowed.

For the past two and a half-ish years, I have suffered from chronic, reoccurring yeast infections. At first I was able to use one day over-the-counter treatments and they would get rid of it, but it would always come back in a few weeks. Then those stopped working altogether, so i switched to using boric acid suppositories, which helped a lot with the symptoms, but the infection would still come back within a month or so. Then the period of relief got shorter and shorter: two week, then one week, and now I only feel relief for a few days after a boric acid treatment before the symptoms come back full swing. I've started making my own suppositories with powdered boric acid and vegan capsules (just because it's much cheaper and I go through then so quickly), but the thought of having to do this every two weeks for the rest of my life is so bleak and dismal that I'm desperate for some kind of solution.

I have tried the following things, none of which have had any noticable effect:

- a prescribed 6-month treatment of flucozanole (I'm a few months into that, still taking it every week even though it's not doing anything)

- two different month-long yeast cleanses (don't remember what brand but there were rave reviews on Amazon for both, still no effect)

- cutting out all sugar and almost all carbs for a month

The only thing that has ANY effect on my symptoms any more is the boric acid suppositories, but I'm scared they're going to stop working too and I'll be forced to suffer through these symptoms for the rest of my life without any relief.

HOWEVER when we meet to go to bars/clubs/parties in the evening...she's very much focused on finding a husband. And it's not fun for me. I am also single and would love to date, but I can't let that ruin my life.

I end up feeling like I'm just wasting my time going out with someone who's not really there with me, AND I feel like a failure that I didn't manage to take her somewhere where she found her dream guy.

Like yesterday I was going to a party and I asked her if she wanted to come. She said yes. I had no guarantees and it was very much a loose plan, it's always hit or miss with parties. Well, it turned out to be bad. She was greatly disappointed. I was disappointed but I can move on and make the best of it.

I'm a believer of keeping energy up, talk to whoever you find, use the opportunity to discover new places. Be nice and be happy, even if the people are not the most attractive people ever. You don't have to force it, but you know, engage! For her, the attitude is to be sulky and consider the night ""a failure"" because we don't come across any attractive single guys. It makes me feel deflated, after all the effort that it takes me to go out, and I feel like I failed her because I didn't manage to get her to meet someone else!

Also when I'm just with one other person, I can't leave her alone and go on my merry way to speak to strangers, because I have to keep her company. But she's literally staring at her drink motionless expecting her dream guy to materialise and initiate a conversation (she likes guys to ""be the man""). She's not being present with me, and I feel trapped.

It's a shame because after yesterday, honestly I'm leaning towards seeing my guy friends instead,  who are perfectly happy to be with me, and engage with me, and are also more open to meeting people and initiate conversations with strangers, which inevitably leads to meeting people/having more fun.

I love hanging out with women, but this is ruining it for me. Why can't it be mutual? Why can't women be excited to hang out with each other? I know for a fact that if I were a guy, she would have behaved COMPLETELY different.

What do you guys do for fun? Where do you go?  Im seeing less and less ladies out in public (aside from work and school) which makes me sad in a selfish way. I need more female friends but i cant meet y'all if youre crocheting or something lol. 

Am I missing the memo? I genuinely want to hang out with everyone but if I had to choose itd be the gals, you know? They just dont seem to want to do anything out of the house anymore.

1708197529.0,Less than a month on the job and a random man (not my supervisor) yelled at me. Should I stay?,"Just started a great new job less than a month ago. I was SO excited for this role. 

I was asked to review a piece of work prepared by another department, and I really noticed that it was missing a whole intersectional perspective. It left out a lot about how different people could be impacted by the initiative, and completely ignored gender and race dimensions. 

When my (white) male coworker (W) who has been nice to me so far asked my thoughts on that report (he‚Äôs of similar age and role) I said pensively that I though it was written from a white male perspective, and we could supplement it a bit. He laughed. I talked to my manager about a plan to deliver some constructive feedback in an appropriate, professional manner. 

Despite that, my off handed comment was delivered by W to the producer of said work (S) within a day. I walked into my first time meeting with S and got totally scolded, yelled at, and belittled immediately. I was apparently racist (towards this white man) and sexist in my assessment. Nobody else witnessed it as all other attendees were virtual. I then had to sit 2 feet away from S for almost 2 hours, holding back tears and shaking. 

I alerted my manager afterwards and they‚Äôre deeply apologetic and say that‚Äôs not how it should be done, and not the usual course of action at the company. They‚Äôll talk to W and S. the problem is, I have no frame of reference yet for the two men involved or the company.

I messed up. I should have used my filter more, at this new job, point absolutely taken.

I do not have many friends so the only people I can get perspective from is his family as I am no contact with mine so it is not always the best advice. We have been married 5 years and together 8 years. 

I have begun exploring some hobbies that I have been interested in for years but have not had the time to really sit down and dig into because I have been busting my ass for these past 8 years to get us in a better financial spot. My husband and I were having a Convo about how I am interested in getting into witchcraft. This has now started a fun little game where anything I say now is answered with sarcasm. I have asked him to stop and it won't. Today it came to a head because I made a comment about how I felt something I saw was an oxymoron and he said ""like you're the one to talk about an oxymoron."" He went on to explain that how can I talk about an oxymoron when I ""All you do is pray to the air and just get my news from TikTok. Maybe you should learn to do actually research."" This beyond pissed me off because 1. I have two degrees (undergrad and MBA) and know how to research properly 2. He did not graduate college due to family things but if we are being stupid technical, I have done more research than him and work in healthcare and have to research shit all the time. I told him that was rude and he laughed and kept making more comments along those lines. I have been short the rest of the day and he is now wondering why I am upset. I just said it is nothing for now because I do not want to just rant with no ""support/evidence.""

For now, I have decided I am no longer talking to him about my hobbies. Not one bit. If I'm doing anything with my hobbies I stop it as soon as he comes because I don't want to listen to the comments. I just don't know if I'm overreacting....
 
Update: my husband wanted to go out to dinner and we just got back. Per him, he talked to his dad and his dad said he was being rude about the jokes and told him that I was probably upset about that. He said he knows but did not understand why I was upset. Per him, his dad said how would you feel if your wife made fun of star wars or your other hobbies. (He has a star wars room in our house).  This put things into perspective and he realized he was being a jerk and that he was being a little insensitive to me with what I'm interested in. We are now heading to a witchy store to look around and get him a book because he said he wants to at least understand what I like. Thank you everyone for the perspectives.

1708194732.0,Tomorrow I am going to break up with my partner of 7 years,"Hi all. I've been lurking on this sub for a while now and some of the posts/comments actually helped me to make the above-mentioned decision. I apologise ahead for the long post.

I am 36F and I've been with my partner (36M) for almost 7 years. But tomorrow I am planning on breaking up with him. While he hasn't explicitly treated me unwell, things haven't been ideal. 

When we met, I thought he was it. He was sweet, helped me out, loved my cooking, we did things together, his family is great and they have been nothing but good to me. We moved in together not long after we got official and less than a year into the relationship, he proposed. I was over the moon. He would be my forever after.

But things only started getting worse from there. He got diagnosed with autism (which I suspected anyway), he had issues at work because of his learning disability. He started putting on weight which ended up in him hurting his knee and requiring surgery. He ended up with more mental health problems and I stood by him, like a trooper, supporting my man. 

But the past couple of years I have started feeling like a single mother, his mother. I've been doing all the cleaning, cooking, laundry, shopping, reminding him the bins need taken out for collection, you name it. He's just been sitting in his ""man cave"", watching movies or playing PS5. Ive been slowly growing more and more resentful. Never mind he put on so much weight he is literally twice as heavy as me. And I'm quite a big girl myself. He has no savings, he blows his salary within a week of getting paid and then asks me to lend him money. 

Reading this sub made me start realising I don't have to put up with this. I started communication my frustrations but he never took them on board. Said I just wanted to argue all the time. 

When I was buying him a Valentine's day card earlier this week, I realised I didn't really feel any of those messages. My last straw was me crying in the kitchen for 20 mins on  Valentine's day night after me handed me a card, box of chocolates and told me he might be losing his job. 

After I break the news to him tomorrow, I will ask him to move out. I don't know how that will go as his parents don't want him in the house. I have told his mum I am planning on doing that, as she had asked me to do it should it come to it.

Wish me luck.


ETA: It's done, it went alright, I'm safe & sound and I will be OK. I'm hoping to post a proper update in the next few days as it's still an ""evolving situation"" in terms of housing.

1708190905.0,Pregnant & Need Advice on How to Want This,"I found out day before yesterday that I'm pregnant. Very early, about 3-4 weeks. 

Let me start by saying that I am in a position where this *should* be purely positive news. I am married to a wonderful man who is the love of my life. We've been married for 10 years (will be 11 in May), and our relationship is better now (even before we found out about the pregnancy) than it ever has been. 

Plus, we've always said we wanted to have a kid someday. Admittedly, while I've thought I wanted to have kids since I was a kid myself, it was always in a vague ""someday"" sort of sense. The desire was real, but at no given stage of our life did I feel ready *NOW*, ya know?

So how did this happen? Well, when we first got married I was on birth control, but I had some pretty serious negative side effects. Found out I had PCOS as well as some other issues. I'd be in better physical and mental health if I wasn't on birth control, and I was told there was a good chance I wouldn't be able to conceive anyway. 

So, for a while, we used other preventative measures, but the years passed, and our forays into unprotected sex increased in frequency, and it started to look more and more like we were unlikely to be able to conceive naturally without fertility treatments. We weren't too worried, we wanted kids someday, and resolved to seek fertility treatments whenever we were ready to ""try"". We stopped using any preventative measures. More years passed. And now, here I am, in my early 30s and pregnant. 

My husband is thrilled! He's over the moon! He keeps telling me that it'll be ok, that we'll face whatever comes together, that I'll be the cutest pregnant lady, that he's ready for middle-of-the-night craving runs, that I'll be a great mom, that he's here no matter what. He's perfect, frankly, and my absolute rock the last couple days. I love him beyond words. 

So, what's the problem? I'm not happy. I'm not excited. I'm pregnant, something I had always wanted (in a vague future sense) and had come to believe was impossible. But, I'm not happy. I'm scared. I don't feel ready, I don't feel up to the challenge. I am terrified of all the changes my body is facing. I have no doubt I'll love my child, but I am terrified about all the ways I could accidentally mess up. There's so many things they need to know, so many values you need to instill in them, so many ways you can accidentally cause issues for them later in life just because you had one moment of weakness and say something you regret. And we're not exactly in the best financial situation. My husband has a decent job, but I'm unemployed and the cost of living is skyrocketing. He's on track for a promotion down the line, and we were considering trying to buy a starter house when that happens - or at least move to a nicer apartment that doesn't have roaches. And I thought, you know, maybe in a couple years when we were in a better position, we would start trying for a baby. But now? Right now? Can we even afford a baby right now?

So that's where I am. I'm pregnant, I want to be happy and excited. But I'm not. All I can think is how hard it's gonna be, how not ready I am, how much I *DON'T* want to be pregnant right now.

I need help. But please understand, I'm not asking for advice on whether or not to keep the pregnancy. I am keeping it. 100%. For a myriad of personal reasons, abortion is NOT an option I'm considering. Please don't offer advice if your advice is to terminate the pregnancy. 

No, I need help from all the moms (and dads) out there. I know there are a million scary, painful things to be aware of, but my brain is already supplying all of those. What are the good things? The beautiful things? The things to look forward to? The fun aspects? The moments that make it worth it? 

Please. I'm desperate. One way or another, I'm having this baby (assuming my body is up to the task of carrying it to term). And I want to be able to have some joy and excitement mixed in with the inevitable worry and stress. This is, obviously, my first child and my first pregnancy. So, moms (and dads) of reddit, do you have any advice on how I can learn to want this?",TwoXChromosomes

She never asks me about myself. She basically just speaks in a monotone voice, giving me a steady stream of information about...beans and other foods?

When I say, ""I know, you already told me"" it doesn't stop her. When I visit her, it is exactly the same. She just talks and talks, and then says ""You know? Are you listening? You know?"" 

I try to spend time with my family as a group and she always finds a way to get me alone. When we are alone she goes into lecturing, giving me an endless amount of information about different vegetables, and then finds some sort of way to insult me...like implying that I'm unattractive or straight up calling me overweight. She is obsessed with weight. She is competitive about it. She says things like, ""How much do you weigh?"" Over and over until I tell her. Then she says, ""WHAT?! Really? I'm only 120 lbs.""

I've tried grey rocking and medium chill. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. 

Have you ever had to deal with this? What is your relationship with your mother like? Have you given up trying to make it work? Have you decided to just accept it as it is?

I told him that I wasn't ""freaky"" and didn't have any interest in being like that and he said he understood. He waited to hug me and I thought he was a really sweet gentleman. He started hovering his hands over my chest and I'd just freeze up and he'd say he was kidding.
Eventually he started groping my breasts and I would try to remove his hands off me but I couldn't so l'd just freeze up and he'd continue and act normal like nothing happened. I'd also just go on as if nothing happened. We went to see a movie together for his birthday and he sat me on his lap and started rubbing my pussy and then fingering it. He had long nails and it hurt but it felt good when he rubbed and I had no idea how to react, I froze again. I started hyper-sexualizing myself. Im not proud but I started seeking him out to please him. I felt like I was just a body. As if my body didn't belong to me. One day when we were dry humping he pulled my shorts down and I froze up and asked what he was doing and he asked if it was okay for him to put the tip in and I said I don't know and I was nervous. He put the tip in and it hurt a lot, it burned. I told him to take it out, that it hurts and he said please a little longer. I hopped off him/pushed him and pulled my shorts up and he said it hurt when I did that because it felt like I almost snapped his dick. I bled from his insertion. I told the story of it once to a friend because I was unsure if that means I was no longer a virgin because he stuck it in for a a couple of seconds and she told me she couldn't look at me the same. For many years, I've struggled with how I feel about it. Was that rape? Does it count as sex? Am I not a virgin? Or is it sexual assault? I was extremely hyper-sexual but now I want nothing to do with sex. I don't touch myself either. I wanted to wait until marriage but it's my fault I froze up. My friend told me that I can no longer do that as it would be unfair to any future boyfriends. I have no desire for romantic relationships anymore anyway so I guess it doesn't matter.

please delete if not allowed! 

this is a very difficult post for me to make, but i think i need input from others as i am completely unsure on whether or not this was a sexual assault or a matter of regret & miscommunication

a few months ago, i had met up with a girl (for context later on: she is transgender) off of a dating app. we had been talking for several months and went on a few dates, but something happened the last time that i saw her that i am still having trouble wrapping my head around.

we were at my house, and had been drinking wine and were both drunk. we had kissed prior to this but had never had sex. after some time, she said, ""so when do we take our clothes off?"". i took my shirt off (consensually), and we made out. she tried to take my pants off to perform oral sex on me, but i told her to stop and that i wanted to keep making out for a little bit before doing that. after maybe 5ish minutes, she stuck her hands in my pants and started to touch me. she did not ask me if she could do this, but i just let her. eventually my pants came off and she did give me oral. i suppose i technically did consent to this part. its the next thing that happened that feels muddier to me.

after all of this, she asked if i wanted to go to my bedroom and i nodded yes. i got onto my bed, and she then took her clothes off and got on the bed with me. i remember wanting it to go further, but before i could say anything/set boundaries, she immediately penetrated me without wearing a condom and said ""im on estrogen, its fine."" (meaning the chance of me getting pregnant was unlikely, although not impossible) i did NOT want to have sex without one, but i froze in that moment and couldn't form words in my brain and say something/tell her to stop, so i just sat there and let it all happen to me. i didnt move, she would just move my body as she saw fit. she was very rough to the point i had vaginal tearing and was pouring blood. it got all over my bed and us (which she laughed at me for). i had bruises for an entire month afterwards from how rough she had grabbed onto me. i could barely walk the day afterwards and continued to be in pain for about a week. 

i remember feeling really violated and alone for a long time after the sex, even now in some ways. i never saw her again because she ended up ghosting me off and on for two months and refused to talk to me about the sex. she said her unresponsiveness was because she felt bad and didnt know how to deal with things. i ended up having a brief pregnancy scare because of the lack of condom (thankfully was not pregnant), but it was very triggering and she was very unreachable/would ignore my messages. i was extremely desperate to talk to her and work through it with her as i could not let myself accept what was going on. and i thought us talking it through would make me feel better about my conflicting feelings. i was extremely depressed for the entire time we were still in contact after the event. i struggled to get out of bed and was crying endlessly almost every day for 2 months.

now, 4 months later, im in a new relationship that is really awesome and healthy and loving, and its taught me a lot about the way ive accepted very awful treatment from others in the past as i didnt know something better was even possible for me. now that i am no longer blinded by my desire for a relationship with this person from the past, i realize something is seriously wrong here. what i do know: she is definitely a pretty awful person (for many reasons not listed here), and i do know that she was deliberately lying to me at some points in the 3ish months that i knew her. but what i am unsure about is: was her not using a condom sexual assault? or do i just have a lot of regret because of the way the situation played out?

This man I‚Äôve never seen came up to us, obviously drunk, yelling at us. I was the only woman in the group so I backed into the sidelines.
He got increasingly aggressive. He had a woman with him as well. When an argument started, this woman attacked me unprovoked. 
After all this transpired, I got the woman off me, and was met with this man. 
He punched me so hard in the side of my face. It‚Äôs been four hours and my ear is still ringing. 
He proceeded to jump into the car with the woman he was with and back into our car as hard as he could. He then drove off. 
We called the police and filed a report but they have made it pretty clear that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt do much.
I‚Äôm very bruised and very distraught.
As a former victim of abuse I just wanted to vent about this. I‚Äôm very worried about the woman he‚Äôs with. I‚Äôm very concerned that he‚Äôll continue this behavior. I‚Äôm very concerned about the lack of action. 
I just needed a safe place to dump this information and wanted to remind all you wonderful humans to please be safe. I don‚Äôt mean to be negative but it‚Äôs so horrible out here and I got reminded of that tonight.

Just want to edit and add: I was with my partner and another close male friend and they absolutely took every step to protect me during and after the incident. I don‚Äôt blame them at all for what happened and they sprung into action immediately after I was hit. The police, however, did not.",TwoXChromosomes
1708169195.0,Guy looked under my mom with cancers headscarf without consent - did he violate her?,"I complimented my moms headscarf today and she replied ‚ÄòI only wear tight headscarves now‚Äô I was confused, and upon questioning found out that a fortnight ago she was at a friends house for dinner and she felt something brush past her head - it turns out her friends husband was lifting her headscarf to have a look. 
My mom is battling cancer - and winning currently, mind you. But she is bald due to chemo. When she started this process it was a big deal for her to lose her hair and she made a firm decision to not only not let others see her bald, but to not even let herself see her bald. She has been very careful with this and doing great, and it‚Äôs been great to see her have this point of pride to hold on to in such a debilitating battle.  
She was crying when she told me what he did, and said she just shut down and hasn‚Äôt slept for two weeks as she just felt so overwhelmed by it. A classic and understandable trauma response. 
I tend to be a confrontational person, and was absolutely livid when I heard the story. We also lost my dad - her husband - to cancer 18 months ago and I just felt like she was kicked once again while she was down by this guy - with no one to defend her. 
So I sent him a message, which started ‚ÄúYou violated my mother's privacy, body and autonomy when you decided to lift her hair wrap. It is no less horrific and disgusting than if you lifted someone's dress. If something is covered, it should not be uncovered without explicit positive consent. I can't believe I need to explain this to a grown adult.‚Äù 

He obviously was livid about this, and in his conversation with my mother where he continued to refuse to apologise, he also refused to believe that this was in the same category as lifting someone‚Äôs dress. 

So, Reddit women, what do you think? Did I go to far with this or did he violate her?",TwoXChromosomes

1708161077.0,Why Some Women Who Have Been S.A.d Ask for Rough Sex,"*Trigger warning for S.A., BDSM, and mild self-harm*

*I wrote this in a YouTube comment as a reply to a man who said that all of his women sex partners have asked for some sort of BDSM. He said it made him uncomfortable because they wanted him to be more rough than he wanted to be and because many or most of them had been S.A.d in the past, so he felt that he might be contributing to some reliving of abuse. Someone wrote me a very kind and encouraging reply saying that what I wrote could help a lot of people, so I thought I would copy my comment here for more visibility.*

When I was first S.A.d, I had never done anything sexual with anyone, nor even with myself, so it was like going from 0 to 10 all at once. My mind was so shaken and confused that I actually started dating the person who had S.A.d me (terrible idea, I know) to fill in the gaps, hoping that going from 0 to 1, then 1 to 2, then gradually up to maybe 5 with him would help me understand what had happened (spoiler: it didn‚Äôt). Some of that involved re-experiencing parts of what had happened during the S.A. in ways that felt safe and controlled. So, that might be one reason the women you‚Äôve been with have asked for things that are painful: to make sense of the S.A. by re-enacting select parts of it in a controlled setting.

Another reason could be that they have PTSD and want to get back at their PTSD for ruining sex, if that makes sense. I don‚Äôt personally like pain during partnered sex but, during‚Ä¶solo stuff, I sometimes will hurt myself intentionally. Sometimes, as soon as I go near my own body, my PTSD will start reacting: ‚ÄúAah! Pain! Tr@uma! Scary! Aah! Aaaah!‚Äù So, I‚Äôll hurt myself intentionally to say, ‚ÄúYeah, it DOES hurt, and do you know what, PTSD? I want it to hurt, and I‚Äôm controlling the pain, so shut up and let me do myself.‚Äù To be clear, it‚Äôs never anything actually harmful, usually just that my body will clam up sometimes and not want to open, and I have to power through the pain of it being shut and tell my PTSD to calm down to get to the part that‚Äôs actually okay. Then, everything‚Äôs fine and no longer painful. There might be moments during sex when your partners, if they have PTSD,  were getting flashbacks, and they may have asked for controlled physical pain as a distraction from the combined physical and emotional pain of PTSD. It‚Äôs like pinching yourself on the arm to distract yourself from the pain of a stomach ache.

But, also, you should take of YOURSELF, too! Please remember that you never have to do anything you‚Äôre not comfortable with. You shouldn‚Äôt leave a sexual experience feeling as if you‚Äôve done something wrong to your partner and feeling guilty or upset. It‚Äôs okay to tell your partner, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not comfortable doing those things.‚Äù If you have a respectful parter, they‚Äôll understand. If they don‚Äôt understand, then they‚Äôre not someone who gets consent, and that is especially horrible if they themself are an S.A. victim. We S.A. victims need to stand together and make sure that every part of sex at every level is always consensual and never a source of emotional discomfort for anyone, including our partners.

1708152777.0,Seeking advice for medical issue... I'm desperate and defeated,"Hi there! Really looking for some support and honestly feeling pretty desperate for some guidance or advice. I'm so frustrated and annoyed I'm crying while writing this. Sorry this is going to be a long one. 

For the last 5 years I've had a copper iud and for the most part everything was fine other than terrible cramping during my period. 

Over the last month I've had a lot of random cramping and always thought my period was coming when it wasn't. Decided something felt wrong and I needed the IUD out. After I spoke to my doctor and removed the IUD she noticed some pain when she pushed on my pelvis area and sent me for a transvaginal ultrasound. 

Immediately after the removal I felt relief, less bloating and like everything was normal again. But slowly over the next few days the tenderness came back. I felt bloated to the point like I was going to pop, a belt of pain around my stomach and back, and trouble going number 2.

Tuesday I caved and went to the ER where I was stuck waiting for 10 hours (Oh, Canada!) and the doctor basically said I have a big period coming. After begging for some tests he did a very brief ultra sound and sent me for a CT scan. 

CT scan came back with the doctor saying again that I have a big period coming and that CT scan said my appendix was fine and to go home. He also mentioned it didn't look too intensely at my reproductive organs. 

Got a call from another doc at the hospital the next morning saying I had an hemorrhagic cyst in my ovary and to call my GP. My GP said to just take some OTC pain meds and that she'd do another ultrasound in 2 months to see if it's gone. Also said to try FODMAP because it's probably gas and not related!!!!! I was almost crying when she rushed me off the phone and hung up. 

Now experiencing similar pains around my lower back and pelvis area (both the sides and the middle). When it's not ""pain"" it's at the very least still uncomfortable and feels like a pressure.  If I stretch or flex is feels like the pain is sort of bubbling. My pee smells very weird and bad (sorry for the TMI). I also feel and look so bloated and swollen that my pants aren't fitting my I constantly feel like my stomach skin is stretching to the max. I also get a weird stabbing pain on my right side (which is weird because the cyst is on the left). 

At this point I don't know what to do. Going back into the hospital is a nightmare and I feel like I can't bother my doctor again without getting dismissed. 

Has anyone experienced these symptoms? Has anyone had a similar experience with the medical system (Canada especially) that can give me some advice on next steps? Anything else I should consider?  

I feel out of options and a bit hopeless. ",TwoXChromosomes

Even in subs dedicated to critical reasoning and considered discussion on the issue of gendered topics, there are very loud complaints about men not being allowed to have emotions as if emotional bypassing isn't a universal experience. Women loudly amplify mens experience of this.

Feelings have long been weaponised by paternalistic predators.

I warned my doctor when she came in and her response was ""Eh, you're here and you're already undressed. We can go ahead if you want.""

But what having your period means is the doctor will have to use q-tips or whatever to swab blood off of your cervix before doing your pap smear. Otherwise instead of getting cervical cells for the actual sample, they'll just get blood cells and the test will be inconclusive. And yes- having blood swabbed off of your cervix is as uncomfortable as it sounds. Like getting a pap smear several times in a row for twice as long.

I (18) got my first IUD inserted a little under a month ago just when February. I knew that the pain would be a lot, so I took two ibuprofen pills about an hour before the appointment and tried to keep myself relaxed. I also got local anaesthetic. It was extremely painful, but I do think the anaesthetic helped a hit.

A few minutes after the anaesthetic wore out, I started to go from my legs feeling numb to a huge throbbing pain, which caused me to skip college that day and rest. I continued to try to take ibuprofen and paracetamol, but it didn‚Äôt do anything for me, so I stopped and waited a few days for the pain to subside. I started taking it again, because sometimes the pain would get so bad I couldn‚Äôt move. I‚Äôve also noticed that if I do too much physical activity for too long, like running, it would cause severe pain which would run down my leg, as though I was being stabbed or burned from the inside.

1708123607.0,An Anxious Avoidant Breakthrough,"I want to share our story in hopes that it helps anyone else going through this situation.

I (37M) started dating my now fiance (31F) about 4 years ago. It started out casually seeing each other for hookups. The flirting was intense. We were very into each other and had an exciting dynamic. We met on Tinder while I was in an open relationship, which meant I was not available as a viable partner for her at the time, which as I know now, was a positive from the perspective of an avoidant attached partner. Eventually, that changed and we did end up becoming bf/gf.

&#x200B;

During the first 6 months or so, we shared an interest in exploring BDSM and all the dynamics that go into that. But as things moved into more of a real relationship, she gradually kept pulling back more and more when it came to physical intimacy. I really enjoy a heavy makeout session and she started to express that she's very sensitive to wet kisses. Sex become less frequent. Flirting slowed down dramatically. I start to ask her about what's going on and she doesn't have much info. She basically says that she's just focused more on appreciating the feeling of security in the relationship and hasn't felt horny like that in a while. And when she was horny like that, she wasn't as sensitive to things that bother her now, such as wet kisses.

&#x200B;

I felt very lost. I didn't know what I was supposed to do in that situation.  It felt very much like a bait and switch and I was already pretty hooked. I didn't want to let go of the relationship, but I didn't know if I could accept life like this forever. I'd end up getting really emotional and depressed and write her these long messages explaining how I'm feeling and eventually we had a long walk and she pushed through the discomfort to find the courage to talk about where she was at. The end result was her feeling like there was something wrong with her and she was broken. She simultaneously was going through some major anxiety from trying to really dial in her diet and exercise and not seeing the results she wanted. She started seeing a therapist, but it seemed generally unproductive. She asked for my patience and understanding. I did my best to be patient and understanding, but I would hit certain depressive episodes that left her feeling guilty and shamed while I still felt lost and scared.

Over time, we each privately developed the tools to understand and empathize with each other. We listened/read *Come As You Are* by Emily Nagosky. We listened to Esther Perel and Bren√© Brown. We learned from countless resources around emotional validation, attachment theory, and relationship dynamics. Each piece played it's part in us eventually finding space for us to connect and understand each other. Many of the resources were not about relationships, but about parenting. She wanted to prepare to be a good stepmother for my kids and a good mother to her eventual future child.

I started going to therapy in the last year and a half or so. Through that time, I had done a lot of work towards improving my mental health and understanding the body. In breaking down what had happened in my previous relationship of 17 years, understanding the emotional abuse that I experienced and still am healing from and understanding the codependence that I've built into my relationships. Recognizing my codependence was a major paradigm shift in how I understood my dynamics, especially around sex.

Through all these processes, we each moved our attachments closer to secure. Hers - avoidant. Mine - anxious.

Additionally, this subreddit along with a couple others, really helped me gain a better understanding of the experience of women and the need to be on the defense from advances from men and being objectified constantly. That helped me tremendously to improve my sensitivity in which I was aware of moments where I may be making her feel pressured or objectified. It was never my intent to make her uncomfortable, but I was now able to shift my mode of perception to give her the space to just be without being perceived in a way she didn't want.

This week, I got COVID and endured a majorly exhausting time caring for my sick kids while also feeling drained and touch-starved. This led me into some depressive episodes where I ended up journaling and sharing those entries with my partner. Those journal entries finally hit the right constellation of situations in our journey and what we've been able to share.

As I was writing my 2nd entry for the week, I came upon the realization that the feeling that I've been looking to gain through sex: embrace, lust, play... really comes down to adventure. And I can take myself on my own adventure and break the codependence for this satisfaction that I've been craving. To give myself permission to go on a hike or learn something new or fix something; it fills my cup in the way that I've been looking for.

In sharing this with my partner, she was so happy to see that I had come to this realization. It gave her space to share that she had been able to tell that I was approaching sex as a way to fix something in myself and she didn't know how to talk about it without it feeling like she was blaming me for something. This was a major breakthrough for us as a couple. To take the burden of fixing me off of our sex life gives it so much more room to breathe.

I'm not that educated on the subject and I want to know how it works especially since I'm currently dating someone.

Does hpv stay in your body forever?   
When do i stop being contagious?  
Can you spread this type of hpv through oral sex?   
Once the wart is gone can i have sex normally or are you still contagious?

I heard people say it clears in 2 years but i also heard that the virus just stays dormant in your blood forever so which is it?",TwoXChromosomes

I‚Äôve been cheated on twice in my life and both times I haven‚Äôt cared at all. I still like with my ex who cheated on me and everything and we don‚Äôt really have any issues. 

The first time I was cheated on my boyfriend (different ex from roommate) had a threesome with two of our friends whilst on LSD, I was at my dads. I told him it was fine, I honestly didn‚Äôt care as long as he stayed with me. You can see how that played out haha. 

Even after the breakup I‚Äôve never felt devastated over it, I don‚Äôt even think about it to be honest. I think cheating is disgusting, I get why people get upset about it and stuff obviously it‚Äôs heartbreaking, but for some reason for me it‚Äôs just.. I dunno! 

Second time my ex (roommate lol) had sex with a drug dealer we‚Äôd just met hours ago in the 10 minutes I left the house to go to the shop. I‚Äôll admit that this one left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, but only for a second and I think I was just jealous of the attention he was getting rather than upset about the cheating. 

I dunno. Is this strange? Why could this be? Anyone else had any weird experiences with this?

1708113336.0,I feel used and disgusted by my boyfriend after we had sex last night.,"My boyfriend and I used to be LD, he moved to a different state for work. About 3 weeks ago, he told me he got fired from his job (budget cuts). It was his dream job and understandably, he was very upset. He has a tendency to shut down when life gets tough. He won‚Äôt talk to anyone. So, when he told me about getting fired, I just knew he would do it again. I have spoken to him about this before, I told him that he can have his space, I just ask that he communicate that. So, again this time I told him I‚Äôm here for him but I also understand if he needs his space for the time being, but to just please let me know. He didn‚Äôt. He saw that message and didn‚Äôt respond. This is the longest he has shut down, it usually only lasts a day or two but this time it lasted 10 days.

After about 10 days had passed, I reached out to him again and we talked a bit. I told him how worried I was about him. He told me not to worry and it was just casual conversation. I asked him how long would he have gone without speaking to me if I hadn‚Äôt reached out. He couldn‚Äôt give me an answer. He said he has been silent with everyone, not just me. I told him that cutting off all contact is not a healthy way to deal with stress and that communicating about needing space goes a long way. He basically told me he doesn‚Äôt have the ability to think that deep right now and is having a hard time focusing on things so I shouldn‚Äôt bring up my issues right now. 

We talked some more, we ended up video chatting that night. And he said he was sorry for how he reacted and said he felt so much better about talking to me. It seemed things were getting back to normal slowly. We texted a bit. He stopped responding again. It had been a week since we talked and yesterday, he texted me again letting me know he is back home now. He texted me while I was driving home from work so I didn‚Äôt have a chance to respond. He ended up calling me 15 minutes later, sounded completely normal on the phone. He asked me if I wanted to meet up. I told I don‚Äôt know and that I‚Äôm really tired from work. Well, we did end up meeting up. Only for an hour. We talked for a bit. We had sex and then he left and went home. 

During the encounter I was not feeling this way because I missed him so much and was happy that I got to see him but afterwards, I couldn‚Äôt help but think that he has barely communicated with me for 3 weeks, called me up to meet me and had sex for an hour and then left to go home. I can‚Äôt help but feel used and disgusted. He got what he wanted and didn‚Äôt care about how I felt about the whole situation. And, I know I should take accountability because I allowed it to happen, and I do. It‚Äôs almost as if he knows he has a hold over me and can do whatever it is he wants and whenever he calls me to meet up, I‚Äôll answer. I have never felt this way about him before.",TwoXChromosomes

I had a kid at 20 and have spent my entire 20s being a stay at home mom to my kids. I feel so much grief about missing out on all the stuff my 20-something peers were doing.

I went down a rabbit hole reading about perimenopause today and it just feels like there's nothing to look forward to in the future. I have not one single female friend, and all the older women in my life have nothing good to say about the aging process. 

I feel like women are only recognized or valued in society for being young and attractive. I know that's a narrow view, and ultimately not entirely true, but it often feels that way. It feels like in a decade I'll become invisible. I'll have to deal with the shitshow of perimenopause and watch my body become foreign to me. I'm afraid of aging. I know it's a blessing, and I've watched friends die young and I certainly don't want that, but I don't know how to accept it when I feel like I haven't done all the things I hoped to do while I was young.

Food arrives and I ask for a bottle of wine, and a slice of my SO favorite dessert to be brought to the table, because my nerves need it for faking it through this and he was showing amazing restraint. I purposefully told my SO to be calm before dinner and let them run the show to see how they'll be. We talked about if it went sideways, that this is also his opportunity to cut ties with them if he chooses. So don't worry he's plenty protective, but I had him in off mode tonight lol. 

""I don't think it's wise to order that wine, and he doesn't need that cake. "" - well it ain't for you and he loves that cake. So he gets cake. 

My SO brings up a wedding we attended Via Zoom lol to lighten the mood and they made a face and.. our waiter came back with that wine at the right time and cake slice.. because you know once you open the bottle, pour, and sip it's on your tab.

Our waiter hadn't even left the table so props to him for keeping that bottle steady while pouring after the bomb drop, but the face he made. His eyes wide as hell. 

All I did was look at my SO for him to just deflate, kiss my cheek, gathered his coat and my purse,  and he went to get the car without a word. It was painful for me to watch him  because I knew he was reall hurt, he loved his parents, but he didn't want to be apart of that anymore and even though we are not having children it's still a slap  to the face to hear that and disturbing. 

While I  sat there and looked at both his parents and wonder how the hell their son turned out so perfect.
I stood up because at this point, I realized I don't want to be on the same level as them, plus there is no reason to keep this quiet and if you wanna play ball like that you're going to be outed. ""For your son and I to even be in your presence is so offensive, having dinner with racist!! I cannot believe I thought you could be civil like a normal human being.

I felt extremely angry

I grabbed his hand 

And right when I walked out the door and it closed my legs shook, my breathing sped up, and I clung to him. We leaned on each other for support as we left and pulled off a few miles down the road to let  him have a moment to gather himself.

He broke the silence by asking for his cake. No utensils so we ate with our hands laughing, because I stole a plate from the restaurant, but he said I looked like a bad bitch doing it.

As the tech moved the wand around my stomach I could immediately tell something was wrong, there wasn‚Äôt much growth from the last time we had a scan.

As the doctor spoke I cried and when he left the room I screamed. It felt like my heart was torn in a million pieces. I was told to go home and I‚Äôd be given further instructions. My doctor called and told me she wanted me to come in for a D&C, which is the medical term for an abortion. She said it was for my own health that they recommend I do it that day. So that day I spent hours at the hospital and when I got home I wasn‚Äôt pregnancy anymore. 

I was told there was a genetic disorder. That even if I did give birth to a full grown baby they would likely not have survived or be extremely disabled and if I had waited I could have put myself through pain, extreme bleeding and risk of infection if my body ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù miscarried.

Because this is what we are being forced to do - because my choice is at risk of being taken away and my life is being put at risk by a bunch of clueless strangers who think they have a right to control my body. I never wanted  an abortion, no one does. We *need* them and the right to have medical procedures be discussed between me and my doctor, not me and a stranger.

1656192228.0,I had a miscarriage on Wednesday. A pharmacist in MO refused to fill my medication.,"This week has been the hardest week of my life and I am not one to want to share these things, but I believe too many people are ignorant about what going through a miscarriage is actually like (including myself before this week).

My husband and I have been trying for a baby for almost a year. I had made so many life style changes, started reading baby books, was taking my prenatal vitamins, and already seeing a physician about possible fertility issue just in case. Finally, on June 4th, I had a positive pregnancy test. My husband and I both cried, it was probably the best day of our lives.

We were overzealous and though we knew miscarriage was an option, you can't convince yourself it will happen to you. We started preparing immediately, buying baby stuff, making lists, and I had a dr's appointment and my first ultrasound scheduled within days.

On Wednesday, my baby was supposed to be 9 weeks and 3 days. We went to the ultrasound and there my baby was. It was there and everything I wanted. Even though I could see it, and it seemed so perfect, I felt in my gut something was wrong because the ultrasound tech was quiet. The silence was deafening and I was convincing myself she was quiet because she wasn't the Dr and wasn't allowed to talk about it. After what felt like 10-15 minutes of pictures, she pulled the ultrasound back to my baby and zoomed back in. She started talking finally. ""And there's your baby, there's the yolk, and the sac... I am so sorry but there is no heartbeat.""

She just sat there, with my baby on the screen, the probe still in my vagina, as I cried and all my husband could do is grab my leg. Eventually she pulled it out and told me she would be back with a Dr. We sat in there for twenty minutes, crying. I spiraled through all the emotions possible grief, anger, fear, guilt, and denial. I almost convinced myself that once the Dr saw the pictures he would know the baby was fine, and the technician was wrong.

The Dr came in and confirmed the baby was not viable. They are able to tell in two ways, one by some measurement (I cannot remember what it was) and by not having a heartbeat. My baby was not viable for both reasons.

The Dr talked with us for a long time and was very kind, but it was so confusing and hard. Miscarriage is confusing and not enough people talk about it. He told me I had a few options: 1) wait to see if my body miscarries by itself. I was not showing signs of miscarriage, and my baby was still there. He said this could take weeks and if the process begins it can take weeks. He said if I do this, I need to monitor for heavy bleeding, extreme pain/cramping, fevers, shortness of breath, and chills. I asked, well isn't miscarrying going to produce heavy bleeding and extreme cramping? His answer was yes. Then how do I know if I need to go to the emergency room? He said well go if you think you need to. If my body did not miscarry itself, I could get sick from sepsis and would put myself at risk and possibly need more emergent care. 2) Take a medical intervention (misoprostol). This will cause the miscarriage and most of it will be done between 24 and 48 hours. 3) Do a D&C, a surgical procedure to remove all the tissue.

The Dr. scheduled me an appointment for the very next day to figure out what we wanted to do. The next day I was with a new Dr to me, but a Dr they specifically chosen because she had dealt with this with patients before and she told me she has went through it herself. Wednesday night, I had extremely cramping and heavy bleeding. I believed this was likely my miscarriage, and it had happened naturally. I told the Dr what had happened, and again realized I knew nothing about miscarriages. She said it could have been. It could have been some of it, could have been none of it. She said I still had the option to wait it out naturally, but again this could lead to it's own risks. We talked through all the options again, and my husband and I agreed the misoprostol was the best option. This way we would know it was done and wouldn't have to live in fear waiting. And to be honest, I couldn't live with knowing my dead baby was inside me any longer.

These are abortion pills. These are what you take when you need an abortion. Let me tell you why I fucking know first hand why no one uses this shit was birth control. I was so scared to take these pills. ""Expect extreme cramping and bleeding, but also go to the emergency room if you have extreme cramping and bleeding."" It was all so confusing. ""Be warry of fevers, chills, shortness of breath, dizziness."" Expect extreme pain, but just rotate between over the counter Tylenol and ibuprofen. Know this could go on for up to 48 hours. Stay home.

And at the end she said ""When you go to the pharmacy, they are going to ask if you are pregnant. If you say yes, they will not give them to you. Tell them instead you are having an active miscarriage"".

Our hell wasn't over. Now we get to go to a Walgreens pharmacy and have to be asked an intrusive question and answer it in front of everyone. You ever been to a Walgreen's pharmacy???????? There is no fucking privacy.  I already had a pit in my gut, I am in Missouri, I was ready for the judgement.

I went to the Walgreen's pharmacy attached to the medical center I was at. I thought it would be safe and they would be the most understanding. And they were... but they did haven't the prescription. She told me she could order it for tomorrow (Friday). My husband had to leave for work on Saturday and I didn't want to be going through this alone, so I told her I needed it today. She told me to try another Walgreens.

We went to the next Walgreens. I asked the technician to check if they had it before they filled it, because I needed it today. She checked and said it was available and they would get it filled. I felt some relief and was ready to get this one nightmare over with and start the next. Then she came out, and she said she was so sorry but the pharmacist refused to fill it.

The pharmacist refused to fill it. It hadn't clicked in my head what was going on, I asked why, she said he said the ""dose was too high"". I gave them my medical paper work (I was not thinking, I just was panicked and wanted this over with). She gave it back to him and came back and just said he refused to fill it. That's it. I asked what I can do, what I need to do. She said she didn't know, there was nothing.

To be honest, I cursed and I cried. I am embarrassed but have I not fucking been through enough? have I not fucking suffered enough? My husband and I went back to the car and we called the original pharmacy, I was crying and yelling and they were so nice. They worked to figure out what they could do for me, and they ended up being able to fill it by giving me a shit ton of lower dosage pills. Thank you to those brilliant angels that went out of their way because they realized how much I needed just some fucking human decency.

I bled a lot on the pills. I cramped a lot and it hurt. I cried a lot and I miss my baby.

And then Friday I was told Roe vs Wade was gone. And I have heard so many people over and over again say this won't hurt women who are having miscarriages and how we are overreacting.

I can tell you right now, the day before it was even gone, that I was denied my medication I needed for my miscarriage. I was denied it in Missouri by a male pharmacist. Right now, it hurts too much, but I am going to call and get his name and file a formal complaint, but this will not end. This will get worse.

I am so scared to have a baby now. This process hurt so much and was so evil and such a fucking nightmare. And now it will be worse. I am so scared of how I will be treated if this happens again. We don't deserve this, no one deserves this.

I was always pro-choice because it's none of my damn business what other women do with their bodies. But I wanted to share my story, because so many people keeping fucking spouting how this won't affect women who have miscarriages.

FUCK YOU to every single one of those people.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I want to say thank you for everyone's kindness. After this situation and then all the Roe vs Wade discussion right afterwards, I was feeling very negative, helpless, and alone. This has made me feel much stronger, more hopeful, and now angry.

My details for the complaint and others to avoid this Walgreens

Address:  330 SW Ward Rd, Lee's Summit, MO 64081

Time: June 23, 2022 at \~4:10 PM

There was only one pharmacist on staff at this time from my knowledge. With these details, Walgreens will know who the person was and I will not have to share a name.

The entire situation:

\- Called them on our way to their location at 3:58 PM, the technician that answered kept getting our last name spelt wrong and would not answer if they could fill it today.

\- Arrive there around 6-8 minutes later, gave details to technician at the counter and asked if she could see if they could fill it today.

\- Technician checked and said yes it was available and went to process the medication.

\- We waited at the chairs in the lobby. The technician came out and said the pharmacist refused to fill the medication, the dosage was too high. I asked what we could do, she said he called our original Walgreens pharmacy (the one that did not have the specific dosage I needed on hand) and they did not answer (WE WILL GET BACK TO THIS). I asked if we could call our physician. She did not respond.

\- THE DOSAGE WAS FOR 600 MICROGRAMS OF MISOPROSTOL EVERY 6 HOURS FOR 24 HOURS. YOU CAN EASILY GOOGLE THIS IS ACTUALLY ON THE LOWER END OF DOSAGES FOR MISCARRIAGE.

\- Gave the technician my paperwork to give to the pharmacist (I should not have done this, but was panicked and did not know what to do)

\- She took it back to him, came back and just said he would not fill it.

\- Asked what I can do? Can I call my physician? What if I call the other pharmacy?

\- She did not respond or give any advice.

\- The pharmacist NEVER CAME TO SPEAK TO ME. Never.

\- I cried and cursed. Sorry to the technician, but no one would help me or give me any information.

\- Left and went to my car. Immediately called the original Walgreens pharmacy. They answered immediately and said they never received a call. I told them about the situation, she was silent and said they were not going to fill it, and started working with me to get it figured out there.",TwoXChromosomes

1574005670.0,I gave my boyfriend flowers to piss off his sexist uncle.,"My boyfriend's paternal uncle is very misogynist and old fashioned. He tries to berate my bf for not engaging in behaviours that fall into the realm of toxic masculinity. My boyfriend, being the strong and confident man that he is, either shuts him down or laughs his comments off. 



The uncle doesn't like me one bit. I'm guessing it's because I have a career, I'm 5 years older than my bf and like him, I never take any bs from the uncle. 


My boyfriend loves to cook. And when he's not travelling, he's the one who cooks for us. When the uncle got wind of this, he actually called my bfs dad and told him to ""get his son away from that harriden"" and that my boyfriend ""needs to start acting like a man."" 



A few months ago, bf and I were visiting his parents and the extended family, including toxic uncle were also there. I had gone out to get some stuff from the market, when I had an idea. I sent my bf a text letting him know that I would be bringing him flowers. He replied with ""got it. Say no more"". 



I later walked into the living room where everyone was sitting and loudly said to my bf, ""look honey I got you pink roses. I know they're your favorite"". My boyfriend stood up placed his hands over his face and said in a high pitched voice ""I love them! Thank you!"". 



You should've seen the uncle's face. He looked as though everything inside him was rebooting and trying to make sense of what he saw. He angrily looked at my bfs dad and said something like ""do you see what's going on here?"". Boyfriend's dad couldn't reply as he was bursting into laughter. As was everyone else. 



The uncle couldn't take it anymore. He just gave me a disgusted look and left the room. Since then my boyfriend's sister has affectionately labeled me the ""flower troll"". 



Neither my boyfriend nor I like to buy flowers. We both think they're a waste of money. However, using them to troll his uncle was worth every penny.

Instead, he tries turning it into a debate and says, ""well you hugged [other female coworker], you can hug me too! Come on, it is just a hug."" I have learned not to JADE from my Reddit use (thanks Reddit!) so I answer with ""I said 'no' and I meant it."" I then proceed try to walk passed him, ignoring anything else he says but he blocks my way.

He says he will hug me anyway. I stop trying to get passed him, look at him straight in his face and with a polite smile I tell him that no, he will not hug me against my will and if he does try to I will not only punch him in his face but that I will get away with it and he will end up the one fired. 

He gives me a confused look and just says ""No, you would get fired?"" Which is when the kitchen manager (who could overhear our conversation from the prep area) grabbed him, removed him from the time card area, and told him ""Noooo, she's right, you would get fired and she more than likely wouldn't even get a write-up."" I clocked out and left pleased with how I handled myself. 

This morning while I'm clocking in for my shift the kitchen manager asks if I have a second to talk. I say sure cause I'm a little early. He tells me he had a very quick conversation with the new cook about sexual harassment. He said because of the complete lack of understanding on this guys part, he called the owner and set up a mandatory company wide meeting with a specialist to go over not just sexual harassment but consent as well. He said if this guy gives me or anyone trouble to let him know. 

So I left work last night proud of how I handled myself and left today proud of how my employers are handling themselves. This is a meeting I'm actually looking forward to going to.

His biggest issue with me was that I would throw away my wrapped (in tissue and a plastic bag to please him) tampons in the trash in the main bathroom where our shower is.
He was disgusting with this and didn‚Äôt want to compromise like I tried doing. I even got a different trash can with a tight lid. (There was never any visible blood or smell) he didn‚Äôt care.
He wanted me to use my private bathroom in my room. Because things like bleeding should be kept far away from him.

I always changed a tampon before baths/showers and the main bathroom was more convenient where it‚Äôs located in the house. Why would I go through the trouble to go to my half bath in my room. It‚Äôs my house? He doesn‚Äôt pay rent. He‚Äôs a guest.

Well my boyfriend took his side. His friend got worse and worse and became verbally abusive to me while my boyfriend watched and let it happen. 
He even tried to get him to kick me out of my own house.
Well I told him it was either me or his friend but his friend couldn‚Äôt stay with us anymore.
My boyfriend picked his friend and I ended the relationship. I told him that I‚Äôm putting the house for sale or I can buy him out. He couldn‚Äôt afford the house without me so yesterday I legally bought him out and I‚Äôm done with this headache. I can now dispose of my tampons however I wish. ‚ù§Ô∏è",TwoXChromosomes

""Can I eat you out?"" in my ear. At first I was simply shocked- I asked him what he said, he repeated the question, and then I told him to never ask me that question again. I sat on the bus feeling my face and hands grow hot and sweaty. I can't describe the feeling, but it sucked.

Well, I was in my art class last week when I walked across the room to ask my teacher a question. I had to bend down to pick something up that I had dropped, and the freshman and his friend happened to be sitting behind me (I'm a junior, but since this is an elective class, all grades can be mixed together). When I bent over I heard whispers, giggles, and dirty remarks coming from behind me. I immediately turned around and shot the boys a dirty look. Then, for the third time, he said... ""Hey, I know I already asked you this question, but can I PLEASE eat you out?"" At that moment my teacher turned around and asked me what my question was. As I talked to my teacher, I couldn't get those five words out of my head. I felt so angry and upset. I rehearsed my comeback in my head.

When I finished talking to my teacher, I leaned over, got uncomfortably close to the kid's face, and I yelled in my LOUDEST and BRAVEST voice: ""What the fuck is wrong with you? You're rude, disrespectful, and disgusting. NEVER ask me that question again. I'll get you expelled for that shit."" Immediately the whole class went completely silent, my teacher stared at me, and back to the freshman, and pulled me into the hallway to explain what happened.

1484109238.0,Please please please god vaccinate your kids,"I'm sitting alone drinking to much again and just need to get this off my chest. Three years ago I had a baby girl, her name was Emily and I loved her more than anything in this entire fucked up world. She was a mistake and I'd only been getting my shit together when I found out I was going to have her. I spent a long time thinking over whether or not I should have her or just abort her because I wasn't bringing her into a good place, but in the end I planned things out and did everything to make sure I could afford her and we wouldn't be living in poverty. I did everything I could for my baby with doctors visits and medicine and working a shit retail job at 8 months pregnant all by myself just so I could bring some happiness into my life. she was born in October and was so so beautiful. I'd messed up a few things in my life but I wasn't going to mess up with her if I could help it.


Then when she was 8 months old, too young yet for an mmr shot? she got sick. She was sick for a while and I'd never seen anything like it. I took her to the doctor. She was in the hospital and she looked so bad, she was crying and coughing and there was nothing I could do. I felt like the worst mother in the world. After I got her to the hospital she got worse, got something called measles encephalitis, where her brain was inflamed. I hadn't believed in god in years but you better believe I was praying for her every day.

She died in the hospital a week or so later. I held her little tiny body and wanted to jump off a bridge and broke down in the hospital. The nurses were sympathetic and I was, well I made a scene I'm pretty sure.


I found out later via facebook of fucking course that the neighbor I'd had watch my baby was an anti-vaxxer and had posted photos of her kid sick and other bullshit about how he was fine.

He was fine? He was FINE? My kid was DEAD because she made that choice. I went over and talked to her and she admitted he'd been sick when she'd had my kid last but didn't think much of it. I screamed at her. I screamed and yelled and told her the devil was going to torture her soul for eternity you god loving cunt because she took my baby from me. I'm sure I looked crazy, at the time maybe I was. I'm crying writing this now, and in my darkest moments I'd wished her kid was dead and it makes me feel worse.


I'd like to say I'm doing better but I'm really not. I'm alive, going day to day, trying to be the person I wanted to be for my kid even if my little Emily isn't here anymore. That's the only thing keeping me going anymore. I don't have anything else left.

Please vaccinate your kids, so other moms like me don't have to watch their baby die. It's not just your choice only affecting your kid, you are putting every child who for some reason hasn't gotten vaccinated in SO much danger. Please please please for the love of god please vaccinate.

I had to use the bathroom before our drive home, so I popped into a mall that was desolate even before Covid times, because I knew the bathroom was right in the entrance, down a hallway to the other side of the mall, but still visible from the front doors. Quick and easy. 

As I walked in, I passed a man in a yellow mask, leaning on the opposite side of a pillar in front of the entrance. I felt him turn towards me as I passed, but I carried on my way. 

I can‚Äôt explain why, but a post I had read on here suddenly popped into my head, about a woman who had avoided a man following her. The top comment I had read at the time said to never go into a public bathroom if followed. 

I passed the hallway into the main shopping center, and saw a dollhouse store to my left. I remembered another comment saying that if you aren‚Äôt sure whether or not you are being followed, to go into a store that the suspected person would not typically have interest in. Instinct took over, and I turned toward it.

There was no one at the counter, so I chose a section of miniatures to admire, all the while eyeing the man in the yellow mask. He casually made his way into the store, and came to a stop at the same section, a few feet from me, but looking in my direction. 

As the realization sunk in, I fought back paralyzingly fear, and reached for my phone in my pocket. I turned abruptly, and quickly walked back toward the exit as the phone ran for my husband, who was waiting out in the car for me. 

The man in the yellow mask turned and matched my pace toward the exit.

I can‚Äôt explain the mixed feeling of fear, knowing the man was almost grabbing distance behind me now, and relief, when the call connected, and I heard my safe person on the other end of the line.

1605954745.0,"My dad died of COVID. I work at a hospital. I have very few friends. Please, I am so tired and just need a hug.","I tried to find a subreddit to post to that could be defined as ‚Äòwelcoming‚Äô and ‚Äòcomforting‚Äô. In hopes that it would be okay I be allowed to post. And when I thought of safe, this subreddit was the first to come to mind.

‚Äî

My dad died less than 12 hours ago from COVID.

He started feeling poorly on Monday. He got ill, began stumbling, on Thursday. I had my mom call an ambulance and he was diagnosed that night. Less than 24 hours later, they called a code blue and he died. He had COPD, heart issues (previous quad bypass), and was 80 years old. 

As soon as he tested positive, I knew the odds were that he wasn‚Äôt going to make it. You know the odds when you work in a hospital. 

I work at a hospital (team lead for breast and gynecological oncology department). I have patients pass away due to cancer all the time. COVID has been there too. Surgeries cancelled. Chemo delayed due to exposure. Patients who die from it. My dad just died from it. My dad died. My dad..

Whenever I get a phone call from a patient‚Äôs family member, letting us know that a patient has died, I stuff that set of emotions in a box. I have to be strong for them and listen to them as their voice breaks. I have to comfort them. And when we find out from the grapevine that a patient passed, I put those feelings in that box too. The box feels full when a patient passes that you‚Äôre close with. That maybe you saw their progression and spent time with them.. and then they are gone. That box gets really full.

I don‚Äôt have many friends. I don‚Äôt have anyone outside of my spouse (and mother) to talk to. I posted on Facebook in effort to find someone to talk to, but my brother (half, older) got upset and told me to take it down. That his kids were out and driving around and he didn‚Äôt want them to see it before he got to talk to them. I posted it to my Twitter (private) but he saw it and called, cussing, telling me to take it down. I took it down.

So I‚Äôm here. I only meant to write two or three sentences but the words started tumbling out. I‚Äôm sorry for whoever sat through and read all of this. I didn‚Äôt mean to make it so long. I just. I can‚Äôt sleep and my dad died and I‚Äôm so tired of COVID. I‚Äôm so, so sick and tired of COVID. I love my job but the work has been exhausting and taxing since March. I love my hospital but it‚Äôs been so, so tiring to be in that building every shift.

My dad died and I feel alone and I just hope it is okay I post this here.

Thank you for your time. This subreddit is amazing and I love reading how supportive everyone is. It gives me faith and hope. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

_Note_ - Thank you everyone who had helped my mom earlier. She was sobbing on the phone. Total strangers she said. I did not know that fundraising was not allowed here. I am so sorry. I deleted my moms GoFundMe link but if you can still help, please - it is on their main website under reddit covid and I made a post on the assistance subreddit with a link like the mod suggested. And again, I‚Äôm sorry for breaking the rules. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

Edit, 8:43AM, EST: I‚Äôm still here and.. want to be here. I‚Äôm so glad that out of the subreddits that I was trying to figure out to post to - this was the one. My brother asked me to at least wait 24 hours to post anything on social media. We are in isolation/quarantine, so I‚Äôm staying between my spouse, toddler, my close family by text, and on here. Internet strangers who are so much more than that. I know I cannot reply to every single person - but I am reading everything posted and its making the heavy weight on my chest a little less heavy. Thank you all - so, so much.

I have tunnel vision and my ears are ringing. I think I may be in shock again. Or something similar. Everyone here is amazing. I just. **I love you all.**

**Edit, 4:07PM, EST:** Again, I am sorry that I posted the GoFundMe link. I didn‚Äôt know I was breaking the rules. If anyone knows where I can fundraise to help my mom, please send me a message. I‚Äôll do anything for her. I did post on r/assistance like the mod suggested (the post is probably easiest found under my user page).

Which was fine but also sucked when it came to me wanting to try things such as manicures, waxing, bra shopping and what not. However, I had a great dad who was always willing to bring me to these things, so I never felt like I missed out on those things. He'd often drop me off and then pick me up or something. 

When I was 16, right around prom time, I decided that I wanted to wax my legs. I mean, I obviously didn't want to have missed spots and I wanted my legs to be smooth and whatnot. My dad was very hesitant. He first said no, not yet, but as prom was approaching I became more and more insistent and he just said fine, that he'd do some research and book an appointment. 

As usually, he held his word and a few days later, I had an appointment with the sweetest waxer I'll probably ever meet. My dad has ONE condition: no upper legs. We convinced him to do a couple inches from my knees, because... Dresses and skirts, but not more than that. 

So that was a little over a decade ago. I continues going to her for a while and then I moved. Summer is here and I booked an appointment with her this morning. After all the catch up we did (a good 5 years!) she said she had to tell me something. 

She told me that before my first appointment, my dad had called her and booked an appointment for himself. He spoke to her about her techniques and whatnot. He requested a full leg shave and she was happy to oblige. After he was done, he told her that he really didn't enjoy any of it but that his 16 year old daughter wanted to her her legs waxed and that he wanted to try it first. He booked an appointment for me that very same day. However, the waxer says that he called the very next day saying he had bruising on his upper legs and that it hurt. The waxer said it was possible and somewhat common, so he vetoed the upper leg for me.

O.M.G. The thing is, this is exactly like my dad. It's something he would do and it's something he'd probably never ever tell me he did. It was just another reminder of how thoughtful he is and always was.

2nd Update - 
https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wn4p45/2nd_update_matt_gaetz_will_be_speaking_at_a_high/

Good evening,

I would like to voice my concern about the upcoming ""Academy Night"" at Niceville High School. As I understand it, this is an informational meeting where students interested in the service academies can meet with Matt Gaetz. I understand that in order to apply for service academies, students need a nomination from their representative, senator, or the vice president. The students NEED his endorsement, and there is nothing that your office can do about that, which again, I fully understand. 

Matt Gaetz is under federal investigation for having sex with a 17 year old girl (the news keeps calling this sex with a minor. In Florida, the age of consent is 18, so this isn't just ""sex with a minor"". That's rape.) and paying for her to travel across state lines, violating sex-trafficking laws.

It is absolutely vile that the school system would invite someone currently under investigation for rape and sex-trafficking into the school to speak to 17 year old girls and put them in a position where they have to ask him for a favor. This investigation has been ongoing for a long time, so the county has had plenty of time to come up with an alternative to allowing him to speak at the school. Any information he needs to give out can easily be done via email, or even a Zoom call with interested students and their parents. 

It seems to me that the school system should not allow someone under investigation for sex with minors anywhere near a school, if for no other reason than out of an abundance of caution. Instead, however, you are quite literally giving him access to potential new victims, and directing them to ask him for something. I would think that the safety of students would be a top priority for Okaloosa County, but this decision leads me to believe otherwise. If a teacher is under federal investigation for sex with a student, does that teacher stay in the classroom teaching while the investigation is ongoing? I‚Äôm fairly certain I know the answer. 

Thank you for taking these concerns into consideration.",TwoXChromosomes

I want to thank you guys for everything. It means so much to hear so much reassurance and hope. Thank you also to everyone who shared their own story with me. 

My daughter is doing well. The staff is optimistic and they all really like her, and she's even smiled and laughed a few times during our visits. I heeded some advice and brought her fuzzy socks and slippers, comfy clothes, her favorite blanket, some stuffed animals she still has, her own toiletries... a lot. She's on board to start therapy asap after discharge so I got her preferences (she wants a woman, understandably) and I'm on the hunt.

I'm setting up therapy for myself as well. Apart from feeling overwhelmed out of my mind, I've also been going through some addiction problems - nothing illegal or life threatening, but I'm done with that shit.))

I am a single father. I just got home from the hospital and I feel so defeated and like everything has crashed and burned today. 

Long story short, this morning I walked in on my daughter sitting on the floor of her bedroom, about to hang herself. We have a great relationship and I even have permission to enter her room if she didn't answer my knocking for a minute because she's always using noise canceling headphones. 

I went to ask her where our dog's harness was, and upon opening the door I just saw her sobbing violently but silently, and looking at the noose hanging in her closet. I knew exactly what it was and I ran to her and yanked it out of her hand.

I told her we had to go to the ER and she began yelling at me. So I ended up calling 911 because I could not physically force her to go on my own.

In the ER, at first she was angry and would not allow me to stay in her room, but she did get calmer and actually asked me to stay because she was scared. We talked to nurses, doctors, and social workers; they were able to get through to her and she admitted how suicidal she was and confided in them that she had been raped by a friend's relative a month prior. 

So they decided to admit her, and that's where we are now. I'm going to visit her every day with her favorite snacks and books. She will be discharged home in (predicted) 7-10 days and I'm looking into getting her a therapist or even a higher level of care if needed. I'm researching trauma and suicide so I can better understand this whole thing. But I'm still so lost and i failed her because I didn't fucking notice what was going on. What else do I do?

We have 3 kids together and I‚Äôm 35 years old, my husband is 40. We discussed it several times and we agreed no more babies and I wanted to get my tubes tied. HOO BOY let me tell you, that was a process. 

So first I had to talk to my gynecologist obviously, and she spent 30 minutes trying to talk me out of it, saying I might change my mind. After I persisted and convinced her that I indeed was done having kids, she referred me to another gynecologist. That dr again spent the entire appt trying to convince me I would regret it. I said no, I absolutely want to get my tubes tied, 100% will not regret it. THEN I had to talk to the therapist about it, who I again had to convince I was absolutely certain this is what I wanted. THEN we had to have a consult with my husband who had to SIGN A PERMISSION SLIP in order for me to get it done. Whatever, I sorta understand that since we‚Äôre in this together and all, blah blah blah. Anyways, it took maybe a month of doctor appointments and convincing everyone of what I wanted to do with my own body and.... the insurance put a screeching halt to everything. Apparently they don‚Äôt cover getting a tubal unless it‚Äôs an emergency. Ugh

So onto plan B, husband gets a vasectomy instead. HOO BOY let me tell you, it was the easiest fucking thing to get done. WTF?! He makes an appointment with a urologist. Says ‚Äúhey we‚Äôre done having kids, I want a vasectomy‚Äù, the doctor says ‚Äúok great, let‚Äôs schedule it for next week‚Äù. Again, WTF?!

I‚Äôm tired of it.

Edit: so a lot of you are asking why a tubal was my first choice and vasectomy was second. I was going to be having surgery for endometriosis already, and since I was going to be opened up anyways, I thought getting my tubes tied at the same time would be simple, but I was wrong.

I've watched as SCOTUS was packed with ""justices"" that obviously would overturn Roe v Wade the first chance they had. And where are we now? Where are we at right now. 


The attack on our rights is no longer ""theoretical"" for women, trans men, non binary people, or minors. It never was. So if you ever told someone they shouldn't worry: Shut the fuck up for once and actually listen to us.

1553971373.0,Cop who Raped Me Gets 20 YEARS in Prison. I feel so free.,"A year and a half ago, I was raped by a cop in my own bedroom. Yesterday the judge passed down a sentence for 20 consecutive years in state prison 85% of which is mandatory. Please remember, there is justice, and no one is entitled to do whatever they want, no matter their power of authority.

After sentencing, I had the pleasure of going to lunch with the woman he sexually assaulted while out on bail awaiting trial. She is an extremely strong and brave person, because she did not have to come forward, but did anyway. Together we know that because of what we did, this rapist will be locked away and off the streets for two decades. It may be hard, but it's never too late to come forward. You do not need to live with the shame of what happened because IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. It may just have happened yesterday, but it seems like the times are changing. Even cops can be held accountable for their actions.

EDIT #2: Now: 7:15pm CA time; This is an overwhelming response. From /u/therealsamshady94, my name has been dragged through the mud in the small town of Yuma AZ, the rapist and his fellow police officers perpetuated false rumors about me over the last 18 months but now I couldn't care less. You see, the morning he attacked me I jumped out of a window barefoot with my mom in tow and ran for me life. I had nothing but the shirt on my back, and the knowledge that had I made any noise in leaving that bedroom, he would take his police weapon which was in plain view the entire night, and shoot me. I didn't feel brave. I did what my body told me to do to survive. Thankfully, how I reacted was ""consistent"" with how a rape victim acts after an attack, there was physical and circumstantial evidence, and the San Diego DA believed me, and decided to prosecute. Out of all rape cases only 4% even are brought to a jury for trial. It's sad how rare these things end with a good outcome, and even sadder how few victims are believed. I have to express my gratitude for the responding officers in this case for not treating the perpetrator like a ""brother officer"" in the words of the judge, but like a suspected rapist. I know had this incident occurred in the rapist's hometown of Yuma AZ, the incident would have been handled differently and the outcome much different. Nevertheless I am lucky. I survived. I just want the world to know when he does get out, if he does get out, his name is JARED ELKINS, he is NOT a police officer, like he told another woman that he raped while out on bail, and he is a dangerous SEX OFFENDER. Also, please don't think about how you act after an attack. Just report it. As I have discovered, you could possibly be saving many other lives in the future from a similar fate, and whatever scrutiny is worth it. ",TwoXChromosomes

1596586646.0,I went to the ER in horrific pain 6 years ago,"I walked into the ER at 4am, doubled over in so much pain that I could barely walk or talk or see straight. I was hyperventilating and so anxious that my muscles were locking up. I really didn't like hospitals, and I certainly didn't like the fact that something was clearly wrong enough for me to be there. I was only 29.

The ER doctor on rotation that night set me up with IV painkillers and had me sent off for scans. The meds helped calm me down, and numbed everything enough that I could stop crying. But when he returned to my bedside, he brought a surgeon with him. They explained the scans looked normal, and my blood work was fine. 

And yet, I was clearly NOT fine. I was in a lot of pain. So they told me they wanted to do exploratory surgery with the intent of removing my ovary, gallbladder, or appendix, most likely. 

I said ok. 

When I awoke from surgery, I was told my appendix had been removed due to some discoloration, but everything else looked healthy. I was to report to the surgeon's office in 10 days for follow up to check on my incisions.

My surgeon stared at my paperwork at the follow up, head in his hands. I thought maybe it was just a long day, unrelated to me. 

""The ER doctor saved your life.""

Turns out I had carcinoid cancer in my apprendix. Its usually pretty asymptomatic, hard to spot, and typically found after it has metastasized all over the place.  

On paper, I should have been sent home with nausea meds and maybe light pain meds and told to see a GI (which would have taken months for an appointment). Statistically, I should have been told to suck it up and it was just a belly ache. But they both believed me. They believed I was in so much pain that the standard diagnostic tools were clearly missing what was actually wrong with me. 

There are so many stories of women's pain being ignored or downplayed. I could have easily been discharged and been one of those women. Who knows how long I would have gone with cancer. 

But they believed me. Both of them. 

They saved my life. And I still think about those two men frequently... how they believed me, a 29 year old woman, about my pain, and took a risk to help me. 

I've been cancer-free for 6 years so far, and get checked every 3 months because this cancer type can pop up randomly. But for now... I'm genuinely thankful those 2 actually believed me.

1664088065.0,I hired an attractive waitress and it's gotten weird,"My husband and I own a restaurant. It's a nice place and we employ people who are expected to act professionally. We have low turnover so we don't hire new people that often. But last week I hired a new waitress because we need the coverage. She's a very pretty woman in her mid-20s. She brought some experience and some excellent recommendations and so far she's been a stellar employee. My problem is with the men who work for me.

Holy shit you guys. I've done my best to cultivate a workplace that is fair and kind and ethical. But some of these dudes have turned into fucking jackasses. It's even worse because I've known some of them for years and they've never behaved this way in front of me before. I thought they were good guys, but all it takes is 10 days with an attractive young woman and they become slobbering pigs.

Tonight I had to fire one of my line cooks. This is a guy in his 40s who has worked for me for years. He worked with my husband before we owned our own place. I'm friends with his wife. And yet he decided that what he needed to do was ask this new waitress out... repeatedly. He cornered her in the walk-in and wouldn't let her leave until she said yes. He's a fucking idiot because he knows I have a camera in there, but here we are. He's fired in the middle of the dinner rush and everyone else had to pick up his slack. Now he's blowing up my husband's phone trying to get un-fired. Fat chance, buddy. My husband doesn't suck.

I'm hoping that one high-profile firing will chill the other dudes out. Because I've seen several of them act like idiots around her. Dudes who I know are married or have girlfriends. We have a Christmas and a summer solstice party for the staff every year so I've met a lot of wives and girlfriends. It's like they don't think I see, or they don't think I remember, or they don't care.

I don't know. I'm just so tired. And I'm down a line cook for tomorrow. And everyone is mad, or sad, or freaked out. I'm sitting here drinking a beer because my husband is gonna walk in soon and we're gonna have to talk about it.

1567262448.0,An ex tried to blackmail with my nudes. I shut him down and took my power back.,"Before I begin, I know that sending nudes is a dumb idea. So please, I don't need to hear it was a dumb thing to do, because I know it was..

To give a little background. I only dated this guy for a few months, and I unfortunately sent him a few pictures that I'm now not proud of sending. We broke up around March of last year and that was it ( or so I thought ). 

Well a week ago this joker messages me. He starts off just wanting to know how I'm doing. I tell him I'm doing well and all. As we are chatting, he mentions that he still has my nudes saved.

He then proceeds to tell me that he wants to have sex, and that if I don't want my nudes public I better listen to him or else. My heart is pounding out of my chest at this point. I come from a conservative family and they would be disappointed in me doing something like this. 

But I also didn't want to be a slave or at the mercy of anyone. Especially this guy. I took a minute to think all of this over. I initially asked him to delete them. I kept asking him over and over and he would refuse. 

Then I decided I wasn't going to let this guy scare me or try to control. And if he did expose my nudes, I would just give my family a heads up. They might have been disappointed, but he was better than being controlled by him.

So I told him to do as he pleased. Then I told him how I have screen shots this whole chat, and that if I see even one picture of mine online I was going to contact the police. I told him he would be guilty of two crimes. One being he tried to blackmail me and the second would be revenge porn ( which is illegal in my state).

I also told him I would send our chat to his family and Co workers so they would know what kind of a creep he is. 

After I sent this, it was silence from him for a good 20 minutes from him. He messages me back and says I'm overacting, and that he wasn't trying blackmail me. He then says he deleted my nudes, so it was no need for me to get all up and arms and go to the police or expose our chat. 

I decided to not message him back, so he could sweat and freak out like he scared me. He started messaging me like crazy begging me not to go to the police.

I finally messaged him back and told him, I wouldn't go to the cops for now. But if he ever pulled anything like this on me again, I am going to the cops. 

I was proud of myself. That I had the courage to not give in to him. I've been a generally weak leoesn my whole life. I scare easily. 

But I don't know where the strength came from to stand up to this creep. The thought of having my nudes leaked would horrify me. But in that moment I was willing to risk that instead of being blackmailed into doing things fir this creep.

***EDIT: The reason why I didn't go the police anyway, because I feel as though this situation is resolved. He was legitimately scared of being exposed by the cops and his family/friends.

If he ever pulls something like this again, I will definitely being contacting the cops without hesitation.

I just want this whole orderal  behind me. And as I've mentioned before, I come from a very religious conservative family. Filing charges and possible criminal case would mean my family would find out that I've sent nudes to someone. They don't even know I date, much less sent nudes to someone.

Obviously had he exposed my pictures, I would have told my family, to save myself from being blackmailed. But if I can keep this from my family, the better***",TwoXChromosomes

Well, first of all, I wouldnt feel anything, because I wouldn't exist. Secondly, if my mom hadn't had an abortion, I wouldn't exist.

My mom grew up in a working class family. She and my dad started dating in high school. She was smart, she got on the pill. But she was ill informed. She didn't know you had to be on it for a full cycle before it became effective. She got pregnant at 17. She was too embarrassed and ashamed to tell her parents, so she and my dad paid for an abortion themselves.

33 years later. They're still married. They both have masters degrees. They live a comfortable life in an upper middle class suburb. They waited until 30 to have kids. They have 3 successful children. They were fantastic parents.

If they hadn't gotten an abortion, none of that would have happened. One or both of them would have had to drop out of high school. They wouldn't have been able to afford college, let alone grad school. They would have made a million more mistakes as teen parents.

Given the choice between those two lives, who would choose the life of an unwanted teen pregnancy? My heart breaks for those who had so much potential and could have had a better life if they had had the choice.

1597355593.0,I sent an email to the professor who laughed me out of a machine learning seminar two years ago,"My senior year of undergrad, my then-boyfriend and I attended a machine learning seminar put on by my university.  There were no prerequisites to attend, I had experience with programming and computational modeling, and I wanted to learn the fundamentals of machine learning before I started grad school.  It was not a graded class; just a mini-retreat held on campus one Saturday.

Out of the approximately 100-150 attendees, maybe four (including me) were female.  I was the only one wearing a dress and makeup.  The professor who facilitated the seminar began by asking questions to assess the general knowledge level in the room.  When he noticed I wasn't raising my hand, as I was brand new to the material, he began pointedly looking at me each time he asked a question.  Then he switched his question style: ""raise your hand if you *haven't* heard of...""

He made eye contact with me and smirked at me every single time I didn't know the answer.  Other men--not all, not even a majority, but enough to notice a pattern--in the audience began to catch on and follow his gaze.  They then began laughing at me.  I literally did not believe they were pointedly laughing at my expense until my ex said to me, horrified, ""They're laughing at you.""

Two years later, I'm ~~getting~~ working on my Ph.D. (sorry for the unintentional confusion--I'm nearly halfway through my program, but I still have a ways to go before I get my degree!), and my research uses deep learning, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling.  Last month, I was invited to give an alumni talk at my undergrad about my research.

Today, I emailed that professor, and I invited him to attend my talk.  I told him that his machine learning seminar was one of the reasons I pursued a career in computational neuroscience.  I included a few details about the machine learning techniques I use and the research I am conducting.  I don't know if he will remember me, and frankly, I don't care.

You can laugh at me all you want.  You can try to play gatekeeper.  But you will *not* get between me and my seat at the table.

My friend Jane has been stuck in a frankly emotionally abusive relationship for a while. She‚Äôs been slowly working on getting everything ready to leave him - things like getting her important documents away to trusted people, finding a new place to stay, saving up enough money etc. but it‚Äôs been hard because he‚Äôs really controlling and he‚Äôll go through all her stuff. 

But then she found out she was pregnant. There was no happiness at the news on her part. He has always desperately wanted kids with her. She never wanted kids with him. She doesn‚Äôt even want pets with him. 

I‚Äôm forever grateful that it‚Äôs relatively easy to get an abortion where we live, and I‚Äôm forever grateful for her doctor. 

Her doctor was amazing.

It‚Äôs part of the protocol here for doctors to get their pregnant patients alone and ask them about anything concerning - like abuse. It was then that Jane told her doctor about her situation and begged for an abortion. She asked her doctor to give her one secretly and lie to her partner. There was no judgement from her doctor at all. Her doctor believed her and immediately took her side. 

Jane managed to get the abortion secretly. Her doctor lied to her partner about everything the entire time. Said that Jane just needed to get some more tests done and that they were busy and it‚Äôll take a while when Jane was really going to get her abortion done. She opted for the surgical abortion so it was really quick. 

Afterwards her doctor lied again to her partner and said that she thought Jane had already left - didn‚Äôt she leave with you? When in reality Jane was leaving with me from a different building in a different exit. 

Jane‚Äôs doctor is the reason she managed to solve her problems instead of ending up with even bigger ones. It was just so refreshing for her doctor to believe her immediately like that. No argument. No doubt. Just completely took her at her word and went above and beyond. I know if I told the people I know in real life they‚Äôd think the doctor was in the wrong for keeping it away from the man in the relationship, but I feel like people here will understand. I just feel like more doctors should be like that and be willing to take extra steps and protect vulnerable patients.",TwoXChromosomes
1608252947.0,"We need to quit acting like IUD's and birth control pills are super easy and no big deal. For many women IUD insertion is EXTREMELY painful. Some get worse cramps and complications. For many women, birth control pills cause all sorts of terrible side effects. Female BC has risks.","I'm tired of seeing guys on Reddit and Quora and in real life, stating things like, ""Well if that woman would have just gotten an IUD"" when she had an unplanned pregnancy, or ""They need to provide free IUD's and better education"" in countries where many poor people have  pregnancies..

Firstly- poor people should be allowed to have babies too.

Secondly-- yes, I support the idea of education and free IUD's and birth control-- but female BC is not just some super easy thing and there is a problem of this being pushed on people. It's not fair to push the problem of systemic poverty and population control solely onto women by pushing them to take the pill and get IUDs. Plus we are constantly told that IUD's and birth control pills are super easy and painless and have no side effects-- and this is a lie. We need honestly from our doctors. Many women have some kind of side effect to birth control pills and this information is still skewed and dishonest. It's so hard to find research regarding mental health and birth control pills. Some studies suggest birth control is strongly correlated to depression, but even with this information, people never want to acknowledge it. They just want to keep women in charge of birth control and not support men's right to birth control. Hey, why aren't there MRA's out there fighting for more male birth control options? hmmm.. I wonder...

Also- IUD's aren't just like, wha bam, super easy breezy. Some women say they barely felt it, but many women say that insertion was extremely painful, some say even the most painful thing they've ever experienced.

I'm tried of the burden of birth control being forced only on women. We need to share this burden with men. Women tend to keep their struggles and pain regarding their female body parts, including trans women who get monthly cramps and PMS type symptoms from hormones. So when we get all these side effects we usually keep it to ourselves and collectively so. We are told our complaints are nothing. We tell our doctors and they shrug in our faces.

You can read here of women complaining about IUD insertion. What's even more sad is we are told pain is so rare and unusual, so they don't even regularly give the pill suppository to soften the cervix the day before, to make insertion easier. They should obviously give it to everyone: [https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/kf4ejh/is\_mirena\_iud\_removal\_as\_painful\_as\_insertion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/kf4ejh/is_mirena_iud_removal_as_painful_as_insertion/)",TwoXChromosomes

We just came home from shopping for the event. Walking around the supermarket was so fun. He carefully chose the meat, drinks, beers whatever. The reason I'm so exited? Well, when he and I met 15 years ago he was bad company. Drugs, Hells Angels and what have you. Never held a steady job. Quite the catch. But I love him. 

During these past 15 years he has made a full 180 change. Got an education. My dad gave him a job at his company in the airport. 

The only thing he had a hard time with was friends. When he and I started getting serious he dumped his old friends. Simply because they were idiots and bad influences. For a very long time he didn't have any friends. Through Playstation he got to know new friends. And those friends are coming over tomorrow. It's going to be a great party. 

We can't have children so I don't know what it's like. But I guess I feel the same as any mother does when her kid is growing up and having his first party. 

What I'm trying to say is. My man changed. Not for me. For himself. Turned his life around and came out the other side as a better person.

He is very quiet and level headed and well liked by my coworkers and management (we hate all vendors except him lol).

Today he came to me and asked if we have any multi pack Gatorade and said ""usually I don't help customers but he is super nice"" I went out to help and saw some on the topstock shelf  (the shelf above the aisle"") and said I cant reach it since im 4'11.

The usually quiet coke guy said ""come on man she at at work and went out of her way to help you there is no need for that"" and the dipship replied ""you know you would"" and winked at him.

 She was 35 with her 5th child and was the bread winner of her house.  Rather than emphasize with his mom he views it as if Roe v. Wade had been around then he wouldn't be here.  

I got sick of him pushing his opinion so I told him a truth that I always felt that he wasn't strong enough to hear.  When I was 14 I started dating an older boy (17).  I was hesitant on having sex and told him no many many times and eventually it because a ""If I mattered to you, you would do it"" situation.  I caved.

So the first time I had sex it was coerced, technically statutory rape, I didn't like it, and the condom broke.  

My dad asked how I could never tell him and my mother.  I told him because he made it resoundingly clear that if I was pregnant that my life was over. Him and my brother spoke about women calling them slurs.  My brother had said he would disown me for being a slut.  My father said I would be expected to drop out of school and work.  These were things they had told me inplace of any sexual education.  I heard these things before I was 14.

I then told my father how my then ex told me that I should lie to my family if I was pregnant and say I had been raped by a stranger so he would be consequence free.  That my ex said he didn't want to be seen with me after the condom broke because it would raise suspicion.  I told my dad how he and my ex put me in a position where I felt I had no one so I planned to kill myself if I missed my period.  I planned to take my mother's opiates and sedatives and I was going to drown myself in a pond in the woods. 

And they only thing that kept me alive was not being pregnant.  I got my period.  But living with the belief that pregnancy was not a choice nearly killed me and that I didn't want to die, I just didn'twant to quit school because I knew I would be stuck in poverty like my parents.  His daughter was almost dead.

My dad looked shocked and said that he wished I would have told them.   And he just kind of sat silent for a while.  I just hope that it has some kind of lasting impact on him.

My sister and him have always had a rocky relationship but over the last few years things had gotten better. They bought a gorgeous huge house, he adopted my nephew and they had a baby of their own. They make a decent amount of money and every vacation they've ever taken my daughter has gone with them. I used to joke about how my daughter was closer to A then to my sister. They had a very close bond and he'd buy her things and just spent a lot of time with her. I now know this was grooming. About 3 years ago we moved 5 hours away from all our family. So for the last 3 years I've sent her back home to spend the summers with family. She'd always stay with my sister. 


About a month ago her school had an assembly about inappropriate touching and how to spot it. Her teacher said after one scenario my daughter started to have a panic attack. She pulled her aside and my daughter told her everything. Last Summer when my daughter was down helping my brother in law started to ""accidently"" touch her breasts. She said she thought they were accidents so didn't say anything. Then he just started to outright touch her. The mother fucker told her ""You cant say anything. You know how mad your mom would get at you."" So she kept quiet. I have told this girl since I can remember that if she's ever in that scenario and told that that she will never ever get in trouble nor would I be mad. I've told her ""even if its grandpa, grandma or even your dad. You will never get in trouble. You can tell me anything."" I dont want to go too far into detail of what else was done but thankfully (I guess) it was always over clothes and she wasn't raped. I know had she never spoken up it would have lead to that. The weekend before Halloween we went back home and I left her with him to watch the movie Halloween with my mom and sister. This was the last time he did it and it was more aggressive this time. I remember picking her up and she was just in a terrible mood. I remember thinking it was the usual preteen moody stuff. Its fucking eating me alive to know I handed her to him without so much as a single thought. 


When the school called me I held it together. I brought her home, we talked, we went out to eat and I set her up an appointment with a psychiatrist. When she went to bed I fucking fell apart into my fiance's arms. It took everything in me not to drive back home and kill him. I called my mom and told her I needed her home in the morning cuz I was going home to tell her something very serious. I didn't tell her cu, honestly I believe she would have gone to their house and beat his ass. I took my daughter to school and drove the 5 hours home. I told my mom and we went to my sisters. I took all the documentation CPS and the police gave me. She went into a bit of a shock. She called him with me there and when she told him he said ""Do I need to turn myself in?"" Right then is when it really hit how real this all was. My sister is the strongest person I know. She kicked him out immediately and is in the process of divorcing him. I talked with her a while and then drove the 5 hours back. 


I dont even really know why I'm posting this. This last month I've been a bit of a zombie. Last night we put up our Christmas tree and I had a break down. I watched my sweet innocent little girl hanging ornaments and I felt a rage I've never felt. I just want to ask him how could he. How could he look at her and see anything but the little girl he's known since she was born. The little girl he's watched learn to walk and talk. The little girl that loved him. I'm just a mess today. I'm in the bathroom having a fucking breakdown at work. I've never wanted anyone dead more than him but that's selfish of me. Then I cant help but think of my sister and my 8 month old niece. He ruined everyone's life. Will my niece know her dad? I'm scared my sister will lose her house. Above all I'm scared of the lasting effects this will have on my girl. Will she recover? Selfish fucking bastard.



Edit; I just want to thank everyone for the kind and loving messages I received. I want to thank all survivors of abuse who messaged me to tell me of their perseverance.

1554708178.0,A guy tried to rape me tonight,"I was walking home, 4 blocks from my house. I saw a drunk guy puking over a railing and asked if there was anything I could do to help him. I‚Äôve done this many times before and usually go out of my way to make sure people are safe and at home.

He responded with ‚ÄúYeah, you can help me get some.‚Äù

At that point I said never mind and walked away, but he followed me. I told him in no uncertain terms that he was to stay the fuck away from me. I walked away again.

He followed. He put his arm around my waist. I told him, calmly as I could, to stop. I kept walking, and this time he tried to grab me around my waist. I started running. He chased me. He caught up to me and he pushed me to the ground. He was pinning me down, and I started just screaming in his face, ‚ÄúHELP ME!‚Äù as loud as I fucking could.

I didn‚Äôt expect anyone to respond. I just wanted to be so loud and annoying that he gave up. In my mind it was my best chance.

But people did respond. Many people. They came out of their houses at 2:00am on a Monday morning to make sure I was ok. They held him in there, on their phones calling the police, while I ran home to safety.

I should have stayed and made a statement. I should have ignored the dude in the first place. I should have done so many things.

But you stepped up tonight, Chicago. Thank you.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your words of support. For those of you that don‚Äôt believe me, that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt need to justify myself to anonymous internet strangers. I wish I could answer all the questions, but the real reason for my post was because of the response I got from my fellow chicagoans, not for the situation itself. The absolute rush of relief hearing someone yell out their third floor window that they hear me and they‚Äôre coming down to help...I can‚Äôt even describe it.

I don‚Äôt regret helping him. Yes, it was terrifying, but I probably won‚Äôt fully internalize it for a while yet. It all just seemed super unreal. It made it click why all stories of rape and attempted rape sound so contrived; because the men who would do something like this are all feeding off the same sick urges and act the same way. But I‚Äôll continue to do the dumb thing and check on people. 

As for me, a woman, stopping to help a stranger at 2am: most drunk people say they‚Äôre fine, they‚Äôre almost home, or that they already called a friend for help. But sometimes they‚Äôre too drunk to walk or they‚Äôre so lost I‚Äôm afraid that without intervention they‚Äôll sleep in an alley. Sometimes they‚Äôre too drunk to use their phones and I‚Äôll help them call a friend or an Uber. Most of the time they‚Äôre completely unaware how absolutely shitfaced they are. And in Chicago the police don‚Äôt respond in any urgent manner if it‚Äôs a wellness check. If the drunk person or some other person isn‚Äôt in immediate danger, they have better things to do. Personally, I‚Äôm willing to possibly put myself in harm‚Äôs way if it might mean saving someone else from harm. Odds say I was going to run into this situation eventually and I will be better prepared to handle it if it, god forbid, happens again.

As for self-defense, I‚Äôm going to get some mace. I hate guns. If you want to really ramp up a situation, threaten a drunk person. If you want to just redline it, pull a gun. Plus, since I‚Äôm a cocktailer, it‚Äôs illegal for me to have it at work, and it‚Äôs illegal for me to have it on the train home.

As for the statement, I called my friend who is a south side Chicago cop and he walked me through making a statement, what good it will do, what to expect, and what information to focus on. I‚Äôve spent the day thinking about everything that happened so I can give the most important details. He said that since other people have likely already made a statement and I didn‚Äôt stay on the scene, one more day isn‚Äôt going to make a difference. I‚Äôm going to make a statement in the morning.

Now that I‚Äôve calmed down, I‚Äôm just mostly angry.  Anger helps motivate me to learn how to navigate a situation better, so I‚Äôm gunna let it ride  and eventually maybe it‚Äôll guide me to a therapist. But we will have to see.

The candy we got must have disagreed with me because after the movie my stomach was not having a good time. 

We went to go to bed and things started to get heated but with my pain going on I didn't feel like having sex and I told him not tonight. 

He kissed me softly and asked if I wanted a backrub or to just cuddle and fall asleep. I wanted to cry. I have never felt comfortable in a relationship before telling my partner no. He didn't even TRY to guilt me or change my mind. Once I said no he just held me close and we talked about nonsense till we fell asleep. 

I wanted to share this with someone because I am so happy about it!!",TwoXChromosomes

Hopefully it's ok to post here. I scrubbed my profile of nsfw pictures and (for reasons that will become obvious as you read on) will not be posting again on Reddit. My goal is for Reddit's admins to take this (and any similar situation) seriously. If I continued posting, he was threatening to stab his ex. I contacted her to warn her. Haven't heard from her, but hopefully she is now more on guard. 
  
  
About a year ago I began to feel extremely self conscious about my body and my inability to lose my postpartum baby weight. At the time my husband and I switched from hormonal birth control to condoms and my libido went through the roof. I created this account soon after to look at nsfw subreddits for some alone time fun. It was bolstering to see so many women with similar shape and size to me being adored and I sort of felt like it might be something I'd like to do. With my husband's blessing, I started posting nudes. None with my face or identifying features and I purposely kept my location vague.  It was very validating, and for many many months everything went swimmingly.   
  
Enter the creep. At first he just awarded one of my posts and graciously accepted my thanks. For many, many months I did not hear anything from him. Now, he has become convinced that I am his ex, regardless of any logical argument I try to make (does she also have the same surgery scars as I have? A prominent mole in the same place? Is she the same age as me? [I looked her up and I doubt it; I think I'm way older than she is]). He wouldn't be convinced and told me my posts are breaking up marriages (I sincerely hope this isn't true and I've heard nothing from angry or bereft spouses, so I just truly don't know) and if I didn't stop posting he would come to my home and stab me.  
  
I reported this message using Reddit's report system. Two breathless days later I received a canned response stating that they have reviewed his messages and they ""don't violate Reddit's content policy."" Not only that, but reddit has seemingly removed all way to contact an actual human who runs this site. It's just a giant list of topics now, none of which include the word violence.
  
Wow. Two women threatened with fatal violence, one completely innocent of any of these things, but hey, it doesn't violate their content policy! C'mon Reddit, we can definitely do better! I was so incensed I nearly messaged their CISO (Allison Miller) on linkedin (which would have revealed my actual identity--rather scary in this situation).
  
In conclusion, I know there are some people on here who will condemn me for my choices and I also know that the majority of you likely wouldn't choose this for yourselves. Regardless, we all deserve to feel safe in this space; we deserve the owners and operators of this site to take our safety seriously all the time, in every case.

The swing vote on the State Supreme Court is up for grabs, where a victory for liberal JANET PROTASIEWICZ will almost certainly overturn the state's total abortion ban","Here's an article going into more about what's at stake:

* https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-redistricting-trump-df0a7e5cfec1cd3bf08f14270a1c9615

After Roe v. Wade fell last year, a trigger law from the year 1849 - over a decade before the start of the American Civil War that ended Chattel Slavery - banned abortion in the state. Despite a Democratic Governor ready to sign a repeal, the Republican controlled state legislature has opposed it, and a 4-3 conservative State Supreme Court slow walked the legal challenge. 

However, one of the 4 conservative justices, Patience D. Roggensack, is term limited, and the state elects SCOTUS judges by a vote so the race tomorrow will effectively determine control of the now deadlocked 3-3 court. A win for Judge Janet will give liberals a majority for the first time in 15 years, ensuring a liberal majority court will now have the final say on the legal challenge to the 1849 abortion ban, and in almost 100% likelihood, throw it in the trash.

AND THAT'S NOT ALL 

Wisconsin is victim to the worst Republican gerrymander in the country, where the maps are so rigged that Republicans only need 40% of the vote to control a majority of the state legislature, while Democrats need a 60% supermajority! Watchdogs have called it one of the most dangerous affronts to democracy in the Developed World. The conservative State Supreme Court has done nothing to address this, but a new liberal court majority is very likely to lead to a legal challenge against the maps. If overturned, Democrats would go to having a fair chance of winning a majority in the state legislature and turning the state fully blue like Michigan and Minnesota recently did. It would ensure that not only the monstrous 1849 abortion ban would be overturned, but Republicans would struggle to get back the legislature to ban it all over again. Right now all they need is the Governor's Mansion. 

Janet's opponent, Dan Kelly, is a hardline conservative backed by the three biggest anti-abortion groups in the state. He was part of a scheme to throw out Joe Biden's victory in Wisconsin in 2020 by sending an alternative slate of electors to vote for Donald Trump instead. He is a mad man, and is very likely to uphold the 1849 ban as well as the maps.

All I have are my vote and my voice, it's past time I start utilizing both."," [Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wkm5v9/matt_gaetz_will_be_speaking_at_a_high_school_near/)

[1st Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wlsl7j/update_matt_gaetz_will_be_speaking_at_a_high/)

I wrote a follow-up email this morning and sent it to the superintendent and copied the school board. I included a link the first post, and let them know that it had gotten almost 3 million views, and the overwhelming majority of the comments agreed with me. I suggested that they take a look at some of your comments and realize that this is a serious issue. Then I asked what the county‚Äôs protocol is if a teacher is under investigation for having sex with a student ‚Äì is that teacher allowed to remain in the classroom? I also asked at what point does the school/county become liable if Gaetz meets his next ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù at an event like this, and the county did nothing to prevent it? I mentioned that I had not heard from anyone, but that I was aware that Mr. Chambers (the superintendent) had been responding to others, and that the gist of his response seems to be shrugging the whole thing off. I ended with ‚ÄúI don't have a child in the school system, but I am a taxpayer and a voter. I've been in contact with a reporter from Newsweek, and I have no intention of dropping this.‚Äù 

A few hours later, I got a call from the superintendent. I‚Äôm not gonna lie, this is so far out of my wheelhouse. I was so nervous. I knew I would be posting an update, so I wanted to record the conversation just to make sure I accurately quoted him. I asked if I could record the call, and he said he‚Äôd rather not, that he just wanted to have a conversation. I assume it was for the same reason that he‚Äôs responding to emails with phone calls in the first place ‚Äì to not have a record of what he has said. He gave me the same spiel he‚Äôs giving everybody else. It‚Äôs not his event, he‚Äôll be there, most of the parents will be in attendance, blah blah blah. I let him know that it‚Äôs at a school, so ultimately it IS his event. He did agree with that. He started by saying that it‚Äôs an investigation and there were no charges or arrests. I asked if they would wait for charges to be filed and an arrest to be made if it were a teacher. Would that teacher still be in the classroom? He said no, they would be put on administrative leave. I asked what the difference was and he paused and said ‚Äúyou would win that argument‚Äù but didn‚Äôt go any further. I wish I would have pushed him more on that.

He did try to tell me that that he wasn't going to be pushing a political agenda. I shut that down and said that that was not the issue. The issue is putting teenagers in front of a known predator.

I asked about what the school‚Äôs liability would be if it turned out Gaetz was guilty and he had been using these events to meet high school girls. He said he didn‚Äôt think that would happen, which leads me to believe he doesn‚Äôt believe the allegations. When we had discussed the process for what happens when a teacher is suspected of having sex with a student, he had said the sheriff‚Äôs office would conduct an investigation. I reminded him that it‚Äôs not the school or the county or the sheriff‚Äôs office that‚Äôs investigating Matt Gaetz, that it‚Äôs the federal government, and that it's real and it‚Äôs serious. I also pointed out that Gaetz‚Äôs cohort has already pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing, which has been delayed because he‚Äôs fully cooperating in the investigation into Gaetz 

He said that the event was an important opportunity for the students. I agreed, and said that getting the chance to get facetime with their congressman is a huge opportunity for students, but that their safety was more important. I suggested that if he wouldn‚Äôt cancel, then the least he could do would be to require parents‚Äô attendance. He said that wasn‚Äôt something he considered. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs still not considering it, but at least it is hopefully planting ideas in his head that this is ultimately his responsibility, and there ARE options. I also suggested permission slips or waivers. At least make them acknowledge that he‚Äôs a creep (allegedly).

The superintendent said that he IS getting a bunch of calls and emails, including a call from the New York Times, so that‚Äôs exciting. Hopefully if we just keep it up, they school district will come to their senses. As one commenter said ‚Äúgod, the bar is just so low‚Äù. We‚Äôre not asking for much, just that you don‚Äôt serve up teenage girls to an accused pedophile on a platter.

Anyway, I will say I‚Äôm proud of myself for standing my ground and not letting the superintendent shirk responsibility. He kept saying it wasn‚Äôt the school‚Äôs event, so I kept pointing out that it didn‚Äôt matter whose event it was, it‚Äôs happening at the school, and he is in charge of the schools. I was relatively articulate and stood my ground, so that felt good.

At this point, I‚Äôm in too deep to just drop it. I think I actually told him that too, now that I think about it. So I‚Äôm trying to get this all out there as much as I can. All but one of the board members are up for re-election on August 23rd. I haven‚Äôt heard from any of them except for one email from one of them that she would follow up, and then nothing. So I sent my post to all their opponents in the election and told them that it might be a good opportunity to blast the incumbent for inaction. I feel like there‚Äôs definitely traction, and a tiny possibility that MAYBE we can get something changed.

This has been a really weird couple of days. It‚Äôs been incredibly nerve-wracking, but also, it feels incredible! I highly recommend everybody tries getting involved. Everybody‚Äôs comments and messages have really been so encouraging so thank you all for that.

The superintendent is getting your calls and emails, so please keep it up, ESPECIALLY if there is anybody in here that lives in Okaloosa County! Academy Night is scheduled for Tuesday, so we have until then to get it canceled. Thanks Reddit!

He walked me home and I asked him if he wanted to have one last drink in my place which he agreed to.

When I finally kissed him he was rather nervous and commented he had little experience in ""these kind of things"", since things heated up pretty quickly.I asked him if he meant he was a virgin, and he very naturally admited that that was the case.

Since I was pretty wasted, I came to the conclusion that it wasn't the best time for something so relevant in someone's life, so I asked him to come over some other day and do it properly in case he wanted to, and, well, he did.

I've been really unlucky in love matters over the past three years, heartbreaks and betrayals included. He's the sweetest man I've ever met. So even though I'm a really sexual person, I'm willing to take things as slowly as he wants.

I would like to hear some advice about how to approach this situation, since I've never been anyone's first, and I would like to make it special for him.  


Edit: Wow. Thank you all for all the good words and pieces of advice. You really made up my mind about some stuff. I'll be sure to update you with whatever outcome. You are awesome!

I recently made a friend with a man while I was out and about playing pokemon go. We started texting and had known each other for about two weeks before he told me that he's a conservative and to ""not judge him"". Fuck that. I am judging you extremely hard and I'll never be your friend. I'll never be friends with someone who votes in oppressive bigots who don't even have more than two brain cells to rub together. This guy said that I was being a bit extreme and judgmental. Huh, I wish I cared. I have one less constitutional right now and you've voted this trash in. Bye bye. I'm so completely done with conservatives that I don't even care to ask what the details of their personal views are and what legislation they support. I don't care, fuck all the way off.

Quick edit! First, thank you kindly for the supportive words. And a couple awards, whoa! Thank you! I was not expecting this post to get much attention at all and should have worded it better. I was frustrated with one man in particular while writing the post, so I focused on ""conservative men"" more so than ""conservative people.""

1584237916.0,I read my Victim Impact Statement in court yesterday. My rapist cried when I read it. So did the judge. Afterwards he apologized to me and... I believed him. It was a beautiful moment.," TW:  Sexual Assault/Violence, Court Proceedings

\*\*\*UPDATE:  Words cannot express my emotional day reading each and every single one of your comments and messages. There were so many who offered encouragement and praise, I was brought to tears more times than I can count. I am truly humbled by the out pour of support and I feel honored that many felt the courage to reach out to me about their own personal experiences.

I feel the need to provide this update because there were some common themes in responses where I think additional context may be appreciated.

1. Yes, he is in prison and he will be there for quite some time. But no, I do not know if my statement impacted the judge‚Äôs decision on length of the sentence. In my state, the victim reads their statement before the judge decides the sentence but after the Defendant has already been found guilty to the crime so, in other words, his crying/apology and my statement in no way allowed him to ‚Äòget out‚Äô of the charges since he was already convicted of the crime by the Court. While the judge displayed empathy/emotions in reaction to my statement, when they were ultimately explaining reasoning for their sentencing decision (and I‚Äôm paraphrasing) ‚ÄòIt is the Court‚Äôs responsibility to protect the safety of the community. When all is said and done, the Defendant committed a violent crime and the Court cannot ignore that.‚Äô I was told by the Prosecutor that the sentence he received was in line with what one would typically receive for a crime like this.   

2. I‚Äôve received many questions about Restorative Justice (RJ) and notice that it‚Äôs sparked some discussion in the comments. I first learned about RJ in a 60 Minutes episode (Season 51, episode 30, air date May 13, 2019). The host begins the segment with ‚Äò‚ÄôWhen we first learned about the RJ Project, it was hard to believe and we certainly didn‚Äôt understand it. The program‚Ä¶ introduces victims of violence to the convicts who committed the crime. Our first reaction was ‚ÄòWho would want to do that, and to what end?‚Äô‚Äô Yes, RJ is a very personal choice. It is not for everybody. And that‚Äôs certainly okay!  The purpose of our Court system is to hold offenders criminally responsible for their crime but it does little to hold them accountable for the healing of the victim (and other affected parties for that matter). RJ is, in many ways, a solution for many victims and offenders who *voluntarily* choose to do it. Yes, it may not be the perfect solution but please remember that this is an imperfect system. The Defendant‚Äôs participation in RJ will in no way affect his sentence. He will not get out early for choosing to participate nor he will not get additional time for refusing to either. It is simply a way for him to have the chance take accountability for the impact on the victim and allows for the opportunity to make things right using facilitation by professionals. Emphasis is placed on avoiding re-victimization at all costs.  Who knows, perhaps I'll change my mind about wanting to pursue RJ, but at least I have the option, and I will be forever grateful to the Judge for understanding and allowing it.  If and when it takes place, which wouldn't be anytime soon, he will still be in prison and I would be visiting him there.

3. I received an overwhelming amount of messages with a common theme of MeToo. I wept with each one I read. To all of you I say, stay strong but also, remember to be kind to yourself. Continue to do what feels right to you. And don‚Äôt feel like anyone has the right to make you feel ashamed or guilty for how you feel.  Remember, after someone experiences trauma, they deserve to feel and process it in whichever way is natural to them. If you are rape victim like me, you are used to not being believed. But don‚Äôt ever feel like you have to ‚Äòprove‚Äô yourself to anyone. I too have moments of weakness and forget my own advice but again, in these moments, please be kind and gentle on yourself. You are doing the best you can in that moment. 

Thank you again for your outpouring of well wishes and support. I am so truly touched by your messages <3 <3 <3

TW:  sexual assault, violence, court proceedings

&#x200B;

I spent 13-1/2 long months waiting for justice after being raped by a stranger in an alley.  Yet, when it finally came time to write my Victim Impact Statement, I couldn't seem to put pen to paper.  I spent weeks working on it.  Then, after a lot of soul searching, I realized that mercy, empathy and healing were more important to me than any anger I had left.  After I realized that, I wrote my entire statement in one night.

When I looked up after reading it in court, I saw tears coming down the judge's face.  When I looked over at my rapist, he was crying too.  So was his family.  And so was mine.  The judge approved the only request I had, to allow for Restorative Justice programming if/when we would ever want to pursue that.  Afterward the hearing, the Victim's Advocate gave me a hug and thanked me for having the courage to say something so powerful.  I told her I meant every word.

It's hard to describe how I feel but what I can say is that it feels like a HUGE weight has been taken off my shoulders.   I will remember this experience the rest of my life and it brings me comfort to feel like I can finally start to let go.  Anyways, I have included the statement in this post - bear with me, it's a tad long.  But I feel the need to get this off of my chest.  Please remember that crime affects everyone differently and in my case, I felt like empathy and the need to pursue a different avenue (restorative justice) was right for me.  However, I can completely understand how others in this situation may feel the exact opposite.  At the end of the day though, Everyone deserves to feel how they feel!

\*\*\*Victim Impact Statement - TW:  sexual violence, anal rape mention

Thank you, Your Honor, for allowing me this opportunity to address the Court today.

This crime that the Defendant committed against me has affected every facet of my life.

Before all this happened, I knew who I was and I liked who I was. I was certain that the groundwork provided by my education, my military service, and flourishing professional career would stand me in good stead whatever challenges may lay ahead. I was proud, I was independent, and optimistic about my future. But unfortunately, the actions of the Defendant on one horrible night irreversibly changed me and the course of my life in so many ways.  After this, it felt like my life wasn‚Äôt mine anymore. In one night, he shattered me into a thousand pieces, and I have spent the last 13 ¬Ω months cleaning up the mess he made.

For a long time, I was not a functioning person. After this happened, I couldn‚Äôt sleep for months. I stayed up, rocking back and forth with the lights on, my bedroom door barricaded because I was so afraid. You see, Your Honor, when you don‚Äôt know where your attacker is, then he is everywhere. He is every sound in the night. Every noise outside your window. Always coming to get you. I spent endless nights unable to sleep, plagued by nightmares replaying what had happened to me. There were many days I couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed, let alone leave my house. When I did manage to get out, I was in a constant state of hypervigilance, jumping at every little sound or movement behind me. I missed countless hours at work and my performance suffered as a result. I fell behind on my bills, even my mortgage at one point, and am still working on picking up the pieces in the many other areas of my life.

For weeks, I cried every time I went to the bathroom because of the pain from the injuries, a constant reminder of the worst night of my life. I am often riddled with anxiety and every time I feel frozen with panic, I am reminded of the sheer terror I felt while he was raping me to the point that I could barely move. I still wish I would‚Äôve fought back harder but, in hindsight, my body was frozen in both fear and pain. The moment he inserted himself into me anally, an act that I had never experienced before that moment, it felt like my body had been split into two. The kind of pain where you‚Äôre frozen in place. A kind of pain I will surely never forget. It consumes you and there is nothing you can do. When it was over, I remember running away from him in fear, thinking that he would surely come after me. Another feeling that still sticks with me to this day. The flashbacks did not begin for several months but once they did, they came with a fury. On a good day, they would last for only a few seconds, leading me into a panic attack with a lingering aftermath lasting a day or two. On a bad day, they went on for what seemed like hours and were every bit as physically and emotionally painful as the real event often resulting in several days of missed work to recover. On the worst day, I was hospitalized.

For the first time in my life, I am taking medications for things like anxiety, sleep, mood, and nightmares. Over the past year, I‚Äôve attended over 30 appointments with my medical providers, most of them for psychiatric services or mental health therapy, but several were also for mental health urgent care and even one hospitalization. I am very fortunate to receive low cost healthcare because without it, I‚Äôm not sure I would be in the place I am today.  In total, my medical bills amounted to only hundreds of dollars, as reflected in the Restitution form, but more so I think they truly represent the significant impact this has had on me.

For a long time, my faith in others was destroyed. I silently condemned every man I didn‚Äôt know, since I automatically assumed that their only intention was to harm me. I felt unreasonable revulsion for any individuals who looked like the Defendant, making it nearly impossible at times to interact with fellow colleagues, my healthcare professionals, and even some friends, all at no fault of their own, but all because they simply resembled the Defendant.

I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning that I do not know the Defendant, Mr <removed name>, he is a complete stranger to me. I am not ‚Äòout to get him‚Äô because I don‚Äôt even know him. I still remember the officer asking me if I knew the name of the man who had raped me, and I realized I had no idea who he was, a feeling I fear may stay with me for a very long time to come. In fact, I did not even learn his name until several days after he was arrested when someone at the DA‚Äôs office casually brought it up in conversation without the slightest idea that I was hearing his name for the first time. I‚Äôll never forget that moment. It took my breath away. Even now, over a year later, there‚Äôs a sort of empty hole inside of me because of this and there‚Äôs not a single day that goes by where I don‚Äôt think about what the Defendant did to me.

Probably the most unpleasant feeling is that of the lasting guilt. Not for the rape-- that was on the Defendant -- But for the consequences of doing the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù and reporting to the authorities: putting a man behind bars and causing his loved ones to suffer immensely.  I think about this often.

The punishment he receives today will no doubt be difficult for him, but I am someone who generally looks for the best in people and I have to believe that you, Mr. <removed name>, are strong enough to overcome this, and that somewhere in the process you will seize the opportunities for healing and growth. The most important thing is to ensure events like these don‚Äôt happen, ever.

In reality, I do not believe people should be defined by the worst moment of their life and what I seek more than anything else is peace of mind. Having, in a sense, been served with my own sentence, I must find a way to live out my life in peace. If it were up to me, the only resolution I would seek is that of restorative justice. I want nothing more than for the Defendant to take responsibility for his actions, understand the significant impact that this has had on not only me, but many others in both of our lives, and to learn from this, so that all parties involved can move on with their lives. Which leads me to the only request I have for you today, Your Honor, I ask that you consider amending the No Contact Order to allow for an exception for the case of restorative justice programming.

I understand that this is not the time or place to facilitate restorative justice practices and that the purpose of the judicial court is to hold individuals criminally responsible for their actions so, I will only say this further. I hope one day, Mr <removed name>, you can find the courage from knowing that your participation in this type of programming will not result in punitive punishment. You know what happened on the night of January <removed specific date>, 2019. You know and I know. And you can‚Äôt erase that.  Most importantly, remember that you are paying the price of your own choices, while I have to pay the price of a choice that you did not give me. This request I ask of the Judge today is about giving you the opportunity to take accountability for your actions and a chance to make things right, not only for you and me, but for all of our loved ones who have been affected by this as well.

I sincerely hope that you find strength, companionship, and moments of peace to reflect in these difficult days. I wish safety, health, and continued support from your loved ones while in incarceration. I know that I would not have made it here today without the incredible support network that I have found in my family, colleagues, and friends since this happened. After finishing your punishment, I sincerely hope you reintegrate quickly into society and go on to live a happy life. Most importantly, I hope you are able to find the inner courage within to accept accountability for your actions.

And with that being said, I leave here today, Your Honor, with a sense of peace, confident in knowing that whatever you decide for sentencing today will be appropriate and just. After all, justice is not justice, if it is not just for all.

Thank you",TwoXChromosomes
1596003391.0,Today a dick in my drive thru decided it would be appropriate to start masturbating in front of me as I handed him his food. So I got the police involved and they called his parents on him.,"Sadly, this has always been a fear of mine. Whenever men fiddle around in their pockets, I always get this flash of paranoia that they're secretly jerking off to the fact that we're unaware. Today it actually happened.

I work at a rather popular coffee chain, and our particular location is incredibly busy, fast paced, and stressful. Customers haven't exactly been the nicest during the pandemic, and I have to put up with a lot of verbal harassment, and I've had people actually threaten to come inside to throw some hands, but this really takes the cake.

I'm a supervisor and took over at the window for my co-worker's break. Two customers into this line, this guy pulls up to collect his order. I kindly greet him, look at his face, repeat his order and hand him his stuff. I noticed he was having a rather hard time focusing on putting his damn card in the stupid chip reader. I was focused on him paying for his shit, so my eyes were on his card, waiting for the ""approved"" text to flash across the screen. An error appeared instead, and as I was about to ask him to try sliding the card, my eyes curiously focused in on what he was doing with his right hand.

I saw something wrinkly and shriveled up in his hand, and at first, I thought it might have been his wallet stuffed with bills, but then I realized it was his *tiny, flaccid, wrinkly, caterpillar looking ass, Jabba the Hutt looking ass penis*. He was fucking *WANKING HIMSELF* while staring into my eyes. I was shocked, disgusted, and very angry. Unfortunately for him, I'm very loud, and very vocal.

*""WHAT THE FUCK .""* I yelled. Customers in the lobby could hear me shouting, poor things. My coworkers were shocked, and confused. ""ARE YOU FUCKING *SERIOUS*, DUDE?!""

He's wearing a mask, but I could see his eyes crinkle. He smiled at me. Of *course* he was pleased by my reaction.

He quickly yanks his card away, and attempts to speed off, but gets stuck behind two other cars in the drive thru. I stick my head out the window to memorize his plate number, but realize I'm in too much of a panic to think straight, so I run to the front of the store, throw the door open, and whip out my phone to take pictures of his truck as he speeds off. 

Unfortunately for him, my phone camera takes *wonderful* pictures. The resolution was crisp and I could clearly read the plate number. I called the police, and they showed up a whopping two hours later. After some research on their end, they pulled up the owner of the car, who was a lady. They called the number, and spoke to a man who apparently was her husband. He had an alibi, but named his 18 year old son who lives with them. He was shocked and apologetic, and said he'd ""talk to his son"", whatever that means. The police officer made it clear we didn't want them returning to our location, and that he would be arrested for trespassing. 

My coworker recognized him and his car; he had come through our drive thru just two days prior to today. I have many young, female coworkers, a few who *only just* turned 18, that I don't want subjected to this kind of crap. I can't imagine how mortified and frozen with fear they would have been.

Hopefully the official police report gets finalized soon so that I can get a fucking restraining order on this dude. I'm so upset, I want to take it even further and get him put on a sex offender list. Ugh.

Why. Why?

Edit:

Since apparently *some* people think my post is fake, here's a fake collage of fake photos I took of his fake truck as he fake drove off through the fake parking lot.

Another edit:

Some people messaged concerned for my safety, so I took the pictures of the truck down. I had no idea this post would blow up. Apparently the picture is still visible, so I messaged the mods to see if it can be removed.

Another another edit:

I'm absolutely blown away by all the comments and messages I've been receiving. Thank you guys! For the awards, the kind words, the well wishes. I'm just really tired. I only got a few hours of sleep last night, I laid awake with my eyes closed for at least an hour. I'll be back later to try and respond to people as things calm down. But I hope that the victims and women out there feel just a bit more empowered to act and do something when they feel afraid of freezing up. And I hope you have people in your lives who would stick up for you, and do everything I did and more to protect you. We don't deserve this crap. ‚ô•Ô∏è I hope you guys are having a wonderful day.",TwoXChromosomes

1538689092.0,My antivaxxer mom never let me get the HPV vaccine. In a couple minutes I'm going to finally get it.,"She always told me I'd die if I get it. My old (male) family doctor told me that only ""bad girls"" need it, and since I'm a ""good girl"" I don't need to get the vaccine. This doctor also used to tell me every checkup from 7-18 that boys will only want me for sex, and that is why I should never have sex.

Finally, at 24, I worked up the gets to get the HPV vaccine. In a couple minutes I'm getting the first shot in the series. 

I'm so excited to not have to worry about getting cervical cancer. If this makes me a loose girl or puts me at risk of a one in a million death, so be it. 

Vaccinate your damn kids, or they'll vaccinate themselves the moment they get the chance.

EDIT: Wow this really blew up. Cool. 

For those of you saying this is an advertisement, yep, you caught me. Totally is. Big Pharma hit me up on Snapchat and said ""yo gurl, post on Reddit and tell all dem other females to prevent up to 16 strains of cancer thereby encouraging them to be sexually loose"". They even offered to pay me with a stick of gum and some dick pics. I couldn't refuse. Could you? 

But for real, guys. What the fuck? I'm literally just a girl who is happy because I exerted control over my own body, took my health into my own hands, and got a vaccine. I wanted some positive feedback for this so I posted about it. I wish I got paid. That would be cool. But I'll have to settle for some sweet, sweet karma.

Vaccines are not bad or scary. They save lives. Vaccinate yourselves, your kids, your grandma, your cat, your dog, your goldfish, and whatever the fuck else you can vaccinate. Stop being scared. Stop believing mommy bloggers and conspiracy theorists. Take care of your health and don't expose yourself to easily preventable but serious diseases. 

Vaccines are cool. Get them.

1640911740.0,"Husband ""forgot"" to tell me his mother is a paedophile.","There are now concerns that something may have happened to my very young daughter after coming home from a visit with my in-laws. When I told my husband that I found blood in her panties, he told me to take her to the doctor in the morning. After a physical and blood work, it was concluded that there was no infection and the blood was from physical trauma. I brought her to my husband at work (he wasn't there the night before or that day because he is a firefighter and was working a 48hr shift) and told him the doctor was concerned about sexual trauma and asked if there was anyone in his family that we should be worried about, he told me that his brother and sister both made allegations of sexual abuse against his mother when they were teenagers (now in their late 20s), that the abuse occured when they were roughly 3-7 years old, and that he simply ""forgot"" to tell me. I cannot even wrap my head around this. How does someone forget something like this? How does someone not immediately tell a potential partner (I was a single mom with 2 children when we started dating, he has since adopted both of them) before allowing very young children around this person? I can never trust him again. I cannot trust his judgement. I feel like I've failed my children as a mother. I'm beside myself with grief over what may have happened to my daughter and the shambles that my marriage has become overnight. I wish I could go back. Things will never be the same. And the thought of navigating the world as a a single woman with children and no support system is absolutely terrifying. 

TL;DR- daughter may have been molested by MIL. Since this concern has come to light, husband just now told me that he ""forgot"" to tell me that two of his siblings accused MIL of molesting them as young children. I'm distraught.

ETA: (Because I'm tired of being fussed at by people who won't bother to read any of my comments), To clarify- I brought her home late that night and noticed the blood as I was getting her jammies on before putting her in bed. I took her the very next morning to the pediatrician for evaluation. Upon his recommendation, I took her that afternoon to a SANE nurse for a recorded exam in Atlanta. That evening I called both law enforcement and DFCS to make my reports. I brought the SANE recording and the clothes she was wearing as evidence to the sheriff's office the very next day and met with a special victims investigator to open a case. I also met with the DFCS case worker that day and reported everything and opened a case with them. We took her to a forensic interview completed by a child psychologist by the end of the week and she has since been put into therapy. And obviously, she has had no further contact with any of my husband's family, especially his mother. No physical, no phone calls, nothing. Please stop telling me to do these things and telling me I'm a horrible mother for not. I've done them. ASAP. I'm doing everything I can, and drowning while doing it.

After a few drinks and some laughs they went different ways home, 2 caught a taxi, my niece and her friends went to get the bus. Her friends bus left 10 minutes before hers usually arrived so she was happy enough to say goodbye and wait by herself, it wasn't even 10. She did her usual text to her mum and myself saying she was at the bus stop would text when on the bus.

While waiting 3 boys saw her and proceeded to chat her up. One of which moved her bag to the other side of him and blocked her from getting it. She had one on her right, one on her left and one blocking her in the front. They were trying to get her to go somewhere with them. Told her they knew a great place to get drinks, they would by them for her all night, even had a place for her to stay if she missed her bus. She told them no and asked nicely if they would leave her alone, they werent listening!

After a few minutes this lad comes up to them, takes her bag off the seat, grabs her hand and tells the boys thanks for looking after his lady and pulled her away from them.
Whole walking her down the street he tells her to walk normal, his names jake and he was going to get her home.
He asked what her name was, asked her if she could videocall someone on her phone for him.

She calls me, I answer and this sweet guy tells me his name, his age and why he was with her. He walks to his car opens the door for her then walks around his car showing my his number plate and any marks he has on his car. He also tells me to screen shot his face and his number plate.

He took her home, told her mum she was being harassed and he had to do something to help her. Anything could have happened to her but he made a decision to not let the happen. 

Thank you for showing her what a real man does, thank you for making her feel safe, thank you for making me see that some men are still raised right and thank you for asking her out on a date I'm hopeful it turns out to be as amazing as you seem to be!!

EDIT: For the people I offended by using 'real man', compared to the 3 boys who harassed her, made her uncomfortable, wouldn't leave her alone, suggested things to her, invaded her personal space, he is a real man. He made sure she was safe, he had a chance to take her out of a potentially dangerous situation and he took it.

I‚Äôve been dating this guys for 5 months, we never really had any issues or never really had any arguments until last weekend. We planned a weekend getaway at my parents‚Äô weekend house in the woods and we were really excited for it. We got there on Friday night and on Saturday I woke up and I was on my period. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be at least for another 4/5 days. My period was pretty much always on time so I didn‚Äôt even think it wasn‚Äôt gonna be now. But when I‚Äôm on my period, I always have horrible cramps, I took a pain killer but it didn‚Äôt help much. So I obviously told my boyfriend and he got really mad at me. Apparently he came there to go hiking and have sex and stuff but well that wasn‚Äôt gonna happen now. It wasn‚Äôt my fault tho. I can‚Äôt control my period but apparently that‚Äôs something he doesn‚Äôt know. He literally said that I should have waited and hold it in until we were back home... because yes that‚Äôs exactly how it works... I‚Äôm so mad at him right now, it was so ignorant of him to say that. And it‚Äôs not like we can‚Äôt go there any other time really. I don‚Äôt understand his reaction.... We haven‚Äôt spoken since and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Update: Thanks so much to everyone who replied! I never thought this was gonna get so many replies! I haven‚Äôt even gone through all of them yet but they‚Äôre all very helpful so far!

1591718900.0,My experience being a woman of color in the US,"Hi all. Throwaway for privacy.

I have seen a lot of stories come forth about what life is like when you have a little extra melanin. I have a lot of friends that sympathize, but they cannot really fathom what it is like. I wanted to share mine. For reference, I grew up in a middle class area in a liberal state. If this is not the place for this, please let me know. But these are experiences that I have lived. Sorry about the length and thank you for reading. On mobile so formatting.


Age 5: My best friend was a blonde little girl. One day, we were walking out of our kindergarten class together, and her father saw us walking together. He rushed forward and put his arm around her shoulder and ushered her away from me as quickly as he could. Later in the school year, we wanted to hang out after school like little five year old girls do. Her mother called my mother and told her how my mom made her uncomfortable, and she no longer wished to have us be friends.

Age 5 on: Having people be surprised that my mom is white, and be ridiculed for it.

Age 8: Called a n***** and told to get off of someone‚Äôs property, I was told that I was allowed to play there.

Age 10: Approached by a basketball coach and forced to play(I had NO talent for basketball).

Age 14: Shopping for dresses with my best friend. As we wondered the store, the same clerk followed us. They try to hide it, they are putting away clothes. We ask my mom why we keep seeing her, and my mom tells us that we are getting the ‚Äúspecial treatment‚Äù.

Age 15: Shopping for hair supplies at a store aimed at black hair products. The Asian owner followed us the entire time, ‚Äústraightening up‚Äù right next to us. When we tried to leave after buying something, which she saw, before we could leave the store, she accused us of shoplifting. She had literally just watched us buy the item that she observed us select from her special treatment.

Age 17: My now husband and I had just gotten out of school, and we walked down the street to the Rite Aid to get some snacks. The security guard refused to allow me to inter the store with my backpack, and they made us leave it up front at the cashier. The guard proceeded to just happen to be patrolling the store in whatever area we were in.

Age 18: I realized how difficult it is to find a hair stylist, because you can 100% tell when someone is afraid to touch your hair, or how obvious it becomes that they have no idea what they‚Äôre doing. But you learn to just pay them and don‚Äôt go back.

Age 19: We decided to get married. My husband‚Äôs dad told him, ‚ÄúYou know she‚Äôs black. Your kids will be too.‚Äù His uncle told him he couldn‚Äôt believe he was marrying a n*****. His dad still treats me like absolute shit to this day. We have gone low contact.

Age 20: Realized that when I‚Äôm not being followed while I‚Äôm shopping, when I actually want help I get treated like I‚Äôm wasting their time. Or it‚Äôs hard to even find someone that will talk to me.

Age 20: I was at in class a predominately white university. I was the only black student in the class while we were reviewing Langston Hughes, and I was asked more than anyone to give my thoughts on the experiences he talked about.

Age 21: Attempted to get a job as a 911 dispatcher. I made it all the way to the portion where you have a super long interview about your life with a sheriff. He continually asked me about my ‚Äútroubled past‚Äù(There isn‚Äôt one) and he didn‚Äôt believe me when I told him that I have NEVER been in trouble for anything. He asked me if I‚Äôd ever had sex in the car, or in any public places. To this day I don‚Äôt know why that was relevant. I did not get the job.

Age 22: I got hired at my current organization because I‚Äôm black and I speak Spanish. How do I know? The manager that hired me told me, ‚ÄúThank God you speak Spanish, when I saw that you were black and that you‚Äôre fluent, that‚Äôs all I needed to know!‚Äù She proceeded to try to performance manage me out, in an attempt to say ‚ÄúWell, we tried to hire a minority but it just didn‚Äôt work out.‚Äù

Age 23: I ran into the same dad from my age 5 recount while I was at work one day. He knew I got married because his daughter was my bridesmaid. He proceeded to tell me how he daughter had done things ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù by going to school and finishing first before dating/getting into a relationship, and that he was so proud of her, but was sorry that I hadn‚Äôt had the same luck.

Age 24: People are surprised at how long and ‚Äúsoft looking‚Äù my hair is. I get asked a lot if it‚Äôs a weave or if I‚Äôve permed it. A lot of unsolicited touching. Can we take a second and imagine that in reverse? I‚Äôve never had my hands in a white girl‚Äôs hair, but imagine if I walked up to a complete stranger, announced that fact, and ran my fingers through her hair. I‚Äôd probably get arrested for assault.

Age 25: I was newly pregnant. It was my third pregnancy, but I had no living babies. My previous doctor couldn‚Äôt see me, so I had to find a new one. I found an OB that would see me, and my husband came. The doctor spent the entire time(without actually examining me) telling me how this pregnancy was not viable. He would not let me leave without getting a STD test. I told him my husband and I are exclusive and we‚Äôd been together for 11 years. ‚ÄúWell, you never know.‚Äù He took the sample anyway during my pelvic exam. When he did the ultrasound, he happily proclaimed that he was right, my uterus was empty. He offered to redo it in 2 weeks. When I left, the nurse gave me multiple pamphlets about being a black mom, and over the next several days I got calls from social workers offering free services and items for low income minority mothers. I never asked for that. They didn‚Äôt know my income. That same baby from that non-viable pregnancy is a year and a half now.

Age 25: It was a group of us out dress shopping for my best friend‚Äôs wedding. We stopped for lunch, and we had to wait for the restaurant to open. We were first waiting at the door, but were not seated first(This restaurant does not take reservations). They proceeded to proceed and wait on 6 other tables, who had ordered and gotten their food, before we were even approached to order our meals.

Age 26: I was pregnant with my daughter and I called into the doctor‚Äôs office multiple times with alarming symptoms. My blood pressure was high, and my limbs were so swollen I couldn‚Äôt sleep because they were hot and throbbing. My symptoms were dismissed until it was almost too late. Even when I was at the ER with trouble breathing and a pain in my chest, I was almost sent home. I still thank God for the OB that ran to grab me before I got discharged and diagnosed me with pre-ecclampsia. She saved mine and my daughter‚Äôs lives.

Age 26: My daughter was in the NICU for 66 days. Any concerns I raised about her care were brushed under the rug. There was a point where I complained to multiple nurses about the mask that they pushed into her face, and they were ignored. She has a scar on her nose now that was 100% preventable.

I want everyone to just imagine for a moment. Imagine that you just got a job. You‚Äôre ecstatic. But you walk in on your first day scared out of your mind, because you know you have to prove you‚Äôre worthy to be there. There is no one else that looks like you.  Imagine going shopping. Minding your own business when you notice the same person keeps asking you for help. Imagine not knowing if your friend group looks down on you because of how you look. Imagine your health, your feelings, your LIFE not being taken seriously. Imagine being made out to be a criminal before anyone even knows you, and being told ‚Äúwow, you‚Äôre not like other black girls‚Äù. Imagine being told ‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre pretty/intelligent/well-spoken for a black girl.‚Äù Imagine being questioned in your own home, or on your way home, simply because you look like someone that committed a crime.

Have you ever been pulled over by a police officer? Were you scared? What did you say? Imagine being pulled out of your car because the officer suspects you to have drugs, but you were on your way to school. You‚Äôre forced out of the car, put in cuffs and you‚Äôve got a boot on your back while you watch the cop‚Äôs partner plant the drugs in your own car. You go to prison for it. Your life is forever changed. Or this, that you were a little tired coming home from work, and you swerved a little. The officer pulls you over and arrests you for a DUI, regardless of having a 0.0 BAC.

I luckily have not been a victim of police brutality. However, my own brother has. He approached a man and was asking for assistance. The man claimed he had a gun, which he didn‚Äôt. That was apparently all the proof the court needed to convict, and he went to prison for three years.

Please, tell me again that we are equal. Please, tell me again that we should protest peacefully. We tried that. He took a knee during the national anthem and was fired for it. Tell me again that I should just deal with how things are, and to learn my place. That I should understand that I am intimidating because of my skin tone.

No. I will not sit down. I will not make excuses anymore that this is okay. I do not want to have to explain to my daughter and son how to not get shot by a police officer, because no matter what we do, no matter how little we resist and go with the flow, we are injured. We are set up. We are jailed. We are MURDERED simply for existing. There is no more time to be quiet. Yes, all lives absolutely matter. But the problem is that black lives matter less than white lives. The system needs to change, and it starts with you.

No more silence.",TwoXChromosomes
1560438277.0,My rapist won't rape anyone ever again,"Edit: trigger warning - description of rape and assault. 


He lost his balls. I found out a week ago, by accident. I never reported him and nobody knew what happened. A girl I met in my hometown last month told about that guy who lost his balls in a street fight or something. She said it's a big secret and I shouldn't tell anyone. Lol. A secret that all the neighbourhood is gossiping about.

I came home and started laughing. I knew I had to tell someone, so I'm telling you. I'm so happy right now. I never reported it because I didn't want my parents to know about it. I didn't want them to be upset, to feel bad for me. I didn't want to go through humiliation of trying to prove it was rape. I didn't want people talk about me as a rape victim, or a liar.

When I was laying there, being raped, I had 2 thoughts in my mind: first, my parents shouldn't know about it, and second ‚Äî what should I do after he cums inside me. I didn't resist, maybe a little bit in the beginning, because I was scared this man who is twice bigger than me will hurt me even more. I didn't want him to hit me, break my ribs, give me bruises because my parents would know and everyone would know. Come to think of it, he probably didn't even think he was a rapist. Yeah, I told no and stop, pushed him away, but he probably thought I was a tease and I wanted it. That's what they always think. And when I stopped struggling ‚Äî¬†he decided it's totally consensual so after a while he pulled out and flipped me to try different position. That's when I saw his balls within a reaching distance of my knee, and kicked him.

I kicked him more so that he doesn't get up and retaliate. You know, it's funny that I was raped that night, but the hardest thing about it was kicking a person who is already lying down and crying in pain. It's actually pretty hard to inflict pain on someone else, did you know that? I had to do it because if he'd get up, he'd kill me. When I left, he was vomiting.

Turns out, he lost both his balls that night. If he had a choice ‚Äî going to jail for 5-10 years, or living the rest of his life as a eunuch ‚Äî I guess he'd chosen jail. I can't help but be content about what happened to him.

So yeah, moral of the story ‚Äî¬†don't rape people. And women, remember how fragile men's balls are. If they are hurting you and you have a chance to kick them ‚Äî go for it. Don't be afraid to hurt a rapist.",TwoXChromosomes

Today I saw her with her hair down and I was struck. It was so shiny, and silky, and her coils bounced as she walked towards me. She's also put on weight (she was severely underweight as her ex had her on drugs and took all her money to feed herself) and honestly she looked like a million dollars.

I got so emotional when I saw her. You can instantly see that she's happier and healthier, and she's such a beautiful soul. Not over a year ago I was losing sleep waiting for the call that she had been killed by her boyfriend. I'm so happy for her I just wanted to share.",TwoXChromosomes

I'm young, working in a male-dominated field and am one of two women who work at the company in any technical aspect. (For what it's worth, my coworkers are all really great - I've never felt ""less-than"" for being a woman and appreciate them.)

&#x200B;

But today this woman visited the office - she was a relative of the founder of the company and was just hanging around towards the end of the day. I happened to stop and talk to her for a moment to introduce myself, as I'd never met her before.

She casually asked me, ""So what do you do around here?""

Me: ""Oh, I work on the software team.""

Her: ""OH! You know things!!""

Me: *\*uncomfortable chuckle\** ""Haha, well I pretend to.""

Her: *\*suddenly very stern\** ""No! Don't say that. The boys would *never* say they ***pretend*** to know things. You KNOW things.""

&#x200B;

I didn't quite know how to react in the moment, but I'm thankful she called me out on my own shit. I honestly needed that reminder and thought I'd pass it along. It's all too easy to slip into the status quo of tiptoeing around men's egos and using self-deprecating humor to keep people from feeling intimidated.

Obligatory edit: Ooph wow, I'm a wee bit overwhelmed atm. Thank you so much for the gold and silver lovely people. 

Some of you think she was out of line saying this, and you might be right, but she was dead on for me. I don't have a problem with self-deprecating humor (and will likely continue to use it when the situation is fitting), and obviously guys *do* use it and this isn't an exclusively female problem. But for me, old habits die hard and I haven't always worked with such an accepting group of guys. She pointed out a very intentional choice I made to be self-deprecating for reasons unrelated to humor. So out of line or not, I appreciate her intentions and am choosing to use her advice in a positive way.

Their bodies go through absolute torture. It's is torture level pain to deliver a baby even with an epidural. Contractions are excruciating. The process isn't safe. Only 100 years ago, it was ROUTINE for women to die in labor. This is not a safe process to go through. 

And you go through all of this while your back, hips, pelvis, and legs are already aching from the watermelon strapped to your stomach.

My oldest son got into an accident and got severely injured a few months ago. He is better now and still recovering but things were looking really horrible for a few weeks after the accident.

While my oldest was in a coma, it was my youngest sons birthday. I feel like crap for it but I completely forgot. I was so terrified that my older son would die that I couldn‚Äôt think of much else. My ex husband and I spent every waking hour at the hospital and regrettably weren‚Äôt really there for our youngest. He was staying with my ex‚Äôs sister.

My youngest came to visit his brother the day after his birthday and he hugged my ex and I, and said he loved us and thanks for doing something for him even in these circumstances. My ex and I had no clue what he was talking about but we assumed my ex‚Äôs sister must‚Äôve done something for him and said we had a hand in it.

I just found out that it wasn‚Äôt my ex‚Äôs sister, it was his girlfriend. She baked a really cool cake for him, bought him a new gaming chair and headset that he wanted, and took it to him on his birthday saying they were from me and my ex.

1598885421.0,The older I get the less understanding I am of a 24-year-old-man being at all interested in a 17-year old girl.,"I didn't really care at the time cos ~ age is just a number ~ after all. But the nearer I get to 24 and the further I get from 17, the *creepier* it becomes. My brother is 17. I cannot **imagine** dating someone his age and I'm only 22. I literally cannot A) see any worthwile reason for dating a high schooler and B) see them as anything but kids. Young adults, but kids. 

I think it really hit me when I realised recently that my ex could easily have been one of my teachers. In fact, that's what he was attending school for (no word on how that worked out). Imagining my brother dating one of his teachers just made me feel gross.

The relationship trudged on for far longer than was necessary. I used to hate his friends for calling me a 12-year-old/baby/jailbait and him a pedo/etc and while I don't think they were always actively trying to ""warn"" me, it should have been a giant fucking red flag the size of Alaska. 

There were a shitload of other problems in the relationship, such as him telling me in all seriousness that he sometimes didn't think others were real and wanting to cut me open to see my organs to verify that I was human (as someone who experiences dissociative + depersonalization to begin with, that was a real treat). There was also extremely fraught and reluctant knifeplay, the time I was goaded into cutting myself again (which I had just overcome after 6 years of treatment) for his sexual gratification, and all the underage drinking and weed usage. I am 100% convinced that I ingested something that was not weed once because I have **never** reacted so badly to marijuana in my life previously or since. I legitimately felt like I was dying. I don't like to think about it. 

Anyway, I know after that last paragraph and myself knowing everything else that happened it seems weird to get hung up on *just* the age gap but good lord that should have been my notice to vacate.

#EDIT: Let me be VERY CLEAR that I am not condemning or judging anyone who is an ADULT and is in a relationship with an age gap no matter how large or small. If you want to date someone however many years your senior/junior GO WILD as long as everyone is consenting, is capable of consenting, and is an ADULT. I would like to point out that I was a MINOR. 

And yes, it is my ""fault"" that I dated him, but I really don't see what challenging me to assign fault to myself accomplishes. Hooray, you're right, it's my fault! I am well aware that I should have declined his advances and merrily carried on with my life. I know that I could have stopped it before things went too far. The fact of the matter is that I didn't. Whose ""fault"" this was is immaterial.

1590201292.0,a guy i went to college with venmo‚Äôd me $106 today,"one night a weeks ago i was mindlessly scrolling through facebook when i saw a post from a former college friend that had recently started driving for door dash. he had lost his job due to the virus and he wrote about how in the wake of the pandemic, as the need for delivery began to increase rapidly, he had half a dozen people leave him $0 tip on the delivery.  

as a former waitress i was very upset seeing this. if you can‚Äôt afford at LEAST $1 on a delivery order, you shouldn‚Äôt be ordering delivery to begin with. i commented on his post, agreeing that people can really suck, and proceeded to venmo him $6. 

that week i had really been feeling helpless with the current world situation. i had donated blood, gone shopping for some elderly neighbors, venmo‚Äôd my favorite to nurse to treat her to coffee, but i was just still feeling hopeless. sending this $6 was almost instantaneous for me, and after he thanked me, i thought nothing almost nothing more of it. (i am lucky to be able to work from home now and currently have a steady job).

today i was out running and over my headphones i heard the venmo noise go off. i wasn‚Äôt in a particularly good running groove and i was surprised, so i stopped to check out what it was. it was a venmo notification for $106. when i saw his common first name along with such a nice message, i was very confused at first. i thought it was a mistake somehow. it wasn‚Äôt until i opened up the app and saw his last name that i made the connection. 

he wrote that he would never forget that i cared, and how i should continue being me and how good things will come. i messaged him out of confusion. i never expected him to pay me back let alone gift me more. he said that he started a new job, his life was back to normal and with his first paycheck he wanted to give back to me because i had shown him such kindness. 

i was speechless then, i‚Äôm still pretty speechless now. promising to pay it forward.

edit: wow! i went to bed last night and this had 11 up-votes and 4 comments. i woke up to so much more. so many nice comments about people feeling inspired to pay it forward, and so many comments about how tipping is wrong, and my comment about my friend deserving at least $1 was entitled. i stand by my comment, when you order a service here in the US you are knowingly agreeing to tip. i'm not saying the system isn't messed up. but that is how it is. 

thank you for all the awards, sweet notes, and positivity on this thread. it isn't lost in the debating over the US tipping system. be kind all.",TwoXChromosomes

I appreciate this sub and the support and comfort it offers to women from different backgrounds, so I thought it would be a great platform for dialogue on an issue that somewhat troubles me.  


As you know, women in the Global South face immense challenges and hardships on different levels in order for them to be able to live as ""normally"" as possible that range from simple, mundane things like driving and going out to major challenges in education, marriage and careers.


I feel resentment when I see western women taking up causes such as:

* Freeing the nipple

* Showing off their menstruation blood

* Manspreading/mansplaining 


I find these causes extremely belittling and trivial when compared to women get killed, imprisoned or mutilated just because they wanted to study, or to not marry a certain man, or not be forced to adopt certain clothing. 


Example:
A woman can't show off her nipples in New York. A woman in Karachi can't show her face because it's been destroyed in an acid attack.  



Do you see how privileged and disconnected it sounds to us, on the other side? Is that truly what oppression and suffering means to the Western women taking up these causes? 


I expect angry responses. I truly am not trying to be antagonistic or undermine any group of women. It is just extremely difficult to comprehend how these issues are considered revolutionary when there are much more deeply rooted problems, particularly economic and political, that should be at the forefront? 



I do understand that causes are not mutually exclusive and one can take up a fight on multiple fronts (socio-cultural-political-economic).  


It just feels like there is an immense disconnect and lack of intersectionality between women in the Global North and in the Global South. Yes partially it is because of the difference in living standards which accordingly dictate different issues and problems, but ..just help me understand. Why are these issues important to you, and how do they make sense to you in the bigger [global] picture?

I think about you a lot and what you did for me that night. 

My (now-ex) was very drunk that night. I should‚Äôve known better than to go out with him and his friends when they were that intoxicated. I should‚Äôve stepped off the subway right away and went back home when I realized how drunk they were, but I thought things were better now. I would learn that night just how wrong I was. In hindsight, I should‚Äôve left him entirely a long time ago. 

They started bullying me during that subway ride and so I got off at the next stop when I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. They followed me off and he was so angry at me. He pushed me hard and I fell down. When I tried running up the stairs, he came for me again and so I punched him in the face. This only made him angrier and so he pushed me onto the stairs as I was climbing, and then picked me up and threw me down the stairs. Then they all ran away and left me there lying at the bottom. 

I pulled myself up quickly and sat on those same steps wondering how the fuck I let myself end up here. You approached me and asked me if I was okay. I recognized you, as you were sitting near us on the subway (I was looking around at everyone because I was embarrassed people were watching) . You saw the whole thing happen. You gave me a pat on the back, and walked away. Eventually I left the underground and sat just outside the station. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. What I wasn‚Äôt expecting, was for my angry ex to return to the station, angry that I didn‚Äôt follow him. I sat there while he threatened and screamed at me. If I fought him I‚Äôd have lost, he was so much stronger and there was nowhere to run. 

Out of nowhere a police car shows up and separates us. He sent my ex away and helped me call a cab to a friends house. That‚Äôs when I noticed you, standing off to the distance, watching. And when my ex finally walked away out of eyesight, you went back down into the subway tunnel. 

I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time, but I now realize it was you that called the cop. He told me someone had called. And you watched them getting aggressive with me on the subway, and followed us off to make sure I was okay. You called the police even after I told you it was okay. IDK what would‚Äôve happened if you didn‚Äôt.

1665976017.0,[TW] Turns out one of the biggest streamers on Twitch is basically a slave to her abusive husband.,"[Article](https://news.yahoo.com/living-fancy-prison-twitch-onlyfans-164247725.html)

Amouranth is one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, period. She's been streaming games on the platform for years, and more recently was one of the first big creators to pivot into regular ""hot-tub"" streams. She's also a prolific OnlyFans creator. It has just come to light that she's been in an extremely abusive relationship since 2016. And this came out from her unmuting her stream while he was berating her to the point of tears over the phone. It's a long stream and not everything is in the article, so here's the rundown. This is where the TW gets real.

* He forced her to do a 24 hour uninterrupted stream, saying that he'd kill her dogs if she didn't
* He threatened to kick her out of the house for mishearing him
* Apparently it was his ""idea"" for her to switch to hot tub streams, and people think he might be ""encouraging"" her to produce as much OnlyFans content as she does. Either way, he definitely takes all the money from both, which lead us to...
* ""I built this empire off your body."" Because that's how you talk to your wife. He's forcing her to do provocative content around the clock and taking the proceeds. He's a pimp for his ***wife***, and he ***admits*** it.
* Text messages show that he controls all of her finances, and has threatened to sink her life's savings into crypto speculations if she crosses him. Very Britney.
* He wouldn't let her even reveal that she was married, because he thought that her presenting as a single woman doing OF and tub streams was more profitable.
* Here we get more into user (and me) speculation. She streams anywhere from 12-16 hours a day, usually in a pool/hot tub with multiple outfit changes and sub goals for squats and such. And when she isn't streaming, she does a lot of OnlyFans. As the dog clip shows, these long stream segments may be coerced. She seems to hardly sleep. She's fallen asleep onstream before, and she occasionally streams herself sleeping (alone, in her room) at night. She presents as a single woman, including sleeping apart from her husband on a livestream to bring in cash while she isn't even awake. And all of her income goes into an account under her husband's control. A lot of things are falling into place for me. Nearly every time I open Twitch, she's live to thousands of people. I thought she was just grinding, because she rakes in ludicrous amounts of money from donos/subs/OF/etc. But it looks like she was basically working in a sweatshop for some Alvin and the Chipmunks sounding asshole who the Internet didn't know existed for six years.

This is horrifying. Abuse can happen to anyone, and anyone can be made to feel powerless. Amouranth is one of the biggest Twitch streamers. She's friends with a dozen other massive creators. She has an audience of millions. And she was under the thumb of an abusive faceless man, and the only way she could start the conversation of getting the word out that she wasn't safe was to keep her stream going during an abusive outburst. She had to show herself crying and being berated to a live audience of thousands because that was the only way she could start the process of exposing her pain. She felt like she couldn't just leave, file for divorce, or reach out to her friends (none of them knew any of this either). I'm just speechless.

**Edit:** A friend of Amouranth's says that she is ""at least physically safe.""

If there's one thing to take away from this, it's the ""I built this empire off your body"" line. Genuinely chilling. When I was digesting all this on my own, that's the one that really broke me.

And i am not even the targeted minority here, we have legit 99.99% of rape and harrasement victims of the entire female population, 


We have such a toxic culture , where if you got raped your social life is over and you should kill yourself ""sheikhs have said that"" and that the only way out of it is marrying the bloody rapist , so girls just never tell


But in private and in a safe space everyone has over a shit ton of stories, girls get raped no matter what age or what they were , then some sheikhs come and say ""they provoked it on themselves by wearing those clothes"" 


Then u ask what clothes are ok, they go anything other than a hot short, some other will go, no anything other than hijab is wrong and worthy of rape, and some go no no it's either niqab or rape, and some go, that women getting out of their houses is enough to provoke men


They are literally  excusing actual rape, and some young sheikh with 2 million followers was asked ""what about women who wear niqab yet get raped?"" He replied "" it's because men saw earlier women wearing provocative clothing, so the pent up pressure is forced upon them""


WHAT, I don't mind horrible and dumb thinking , but not when it has this influence and has no logic or proof or sense or anything


Imagine having Christian friends in this community, if i walk with a girl in the street we get harrased together and commented on, and people walk up to is saying dumb and offensive stuff like ""get out of here we don't want sluts like you here"" ""hey prostitute come to me after him please""


And the worst part is, i am a coward, I can't stand up though i know i am right, i can't defend or help anyone because i know if i even try to do anything they will harm both me and her horribly, and it will be without purpose


I open social media to find 80% of people supporting rape culture , actual rape, because who wouldn't when you have the power, every female friend I've gotten close to has told me a story of messed up sexual harrasement, and many of them have shared suicidal thoughts 


Any woman who tries to say anything is branded an ""atheist"" and a dumb ""feminist"", if a woman walks alone , no matter what she is wearing has the chance of 99.99% of getting raped or harrased, and he can't tell anyone or defend herself or either she is a dumb atheist feminist and how dare she think she has the same rights as men to walk in the street


And why would i come whine here, is it karma whoring, or virtue signaling


No, the issue is that people that share my thoughts here are people who are already rich enough to live in upper class and have enough influence and money to stop it, never face people like this, so we have not much of any activism


I have no platform, money, followers, looks, smarts, anything


I always came to reddit to find relatable people and ignore the hell hole i live in, but it's becoming harder everyday, and i am scared and weak, I don't even know what i want


If anyone can do anything, wether awareness, support or any form of help 


Please do, i hate being a weakling but that is who i am, i hope i can reach out to someone or people that can help, save me, save us


(edit:many people have this misconception , but i am a male, and i don't promote the idea of just travelling to a safe space, though logical and should be done,the idea of giving up on my country and leaving my friends and family behind to rot is holding me back , and stop blaming islam corrupt people will use whatever people are following and twist it)
 
Going even deeper, women aren't encouraged to find a job or travel or study much, as much as they are told ""when you marry a man, you'll be free to do as you please"", newsflash ,nope

There was a story of 2 women surrounded by 200 rapists, they sat in a store and called for help, and out was standing the rapists trying to get in, the  store owner had to kick them out because they might cause his property damage, from start to finish it is recorded and it is horrifying,and media said ""it's up for debate, did you see what they wore"", literally they had to get 4 male friends fighting a crowd of gropers who laughed as they pulled them from clothes and hair as they were crying

Women get called horrible shit and bullied online, people ""sliding""into the dms with entitlement, that if women don't respond , they steal pictures and threaten them with photoshoping them on nude bodies and ruin their lives and share them, while sending horrendous comments and pictures, and that is not extreme cases it also is a the norm

People who grope in public, harras online, black mail , are considered ""cool"" people ""living the life""

People of our community are discouraged to travel and leave the country, it's considered unpatriotic, and they always go ""look at their politicial issues, the even accept gays, they are no better than us if not worse, stay in a muslim country"" ,so most people think that this is the same everywhere, so no one seeks change or asylum as much

(People on reddit are twisting my words and using them to push political views, the same issue i am against, i stated facts of what happens, that any research will prove me right, i have said my own personal experience that many in the comments share similar experiences if not worse, if i am being punished for saying what is happening and what i feel about it , then so be it)

But i never advocate they stop taking immigrants, i support it whole heartedly,and it the most reasonable choice for us, and should be accepted by all

I never said i am against islam and said my issue was never with islam, it's with corrupt people in power here who use whatever works to control people, wether comedy, religion,culture,
Plus i am a Christian hence my name, and there are Christian people using Christian faith to support this insanity, so apparently the way i see it, the issie is with culture not religion currently

People will put their fingers in their ears and say i am a puppet, or i am a blind retard who supports islam, or a puppet made to be anti islam, the the whole post is about people like you who twist words to get what they want 

I am not saying arabs are bad, i am saying we still have a long road to go, and i hope we go it , so people DMing or commenting, do some research then come with an argument, not ""he's wrong, cuz I don't want to think about this""


And if you want to do research, there is the story of the 2 girls surrounded by the 200 rapists with videos proof, there is the story of the rapist of over 100 in the auc his name is ahmed something and was only jailed because public outcry but  will be let loose in no time after the fuss is over, just like what happend last time when another controversy happened when a teen killed another teen for defending a hirl from sexual harrasement, while caught in camer, it was glossed over , and you have sheikh abdullah elroshdy , he is one of the famous radical fake sheikhs, who abuses people's lack of knowledge and uses islam as a veil for his extremist thoughts, and he has a huge following

The problem is, no one in Egypt is denying these things happened, the problem is hos they excuse it, do your research if you want, talk to any girl who lives in egypt, males here don't notice it, and won't notice it unless they get  of their own way and they excuse it in their head, i am jot cherry picking, literally ask any girl who lives in Egypt",TwoXChromosomes

1512668711.0,"I have a Yeast Infection, No Money, No Health Insurance, and I went to Planned Parenthood. My Visit and Treatment Was Covered by Their Insurance.","[Yeast infection, Planned Parenthood, Great Review]

I‚Äôve had a really persistent yeast infection for just over a month now and I went to planned parent hood to get it checked out. I have about 2 cents in my bank account, I am a 21 year old female. I‚Äôm currently uninsured, I‚Äôm a full time student (on my own) who is also a Resident Assistant, and works for the Campus Recycling Center. Being an RA covers my college room and board, and I get a stipend of $20 bi weekly. I work 8 hours a week at the recycling center and get about $120 bi weekly. That‚Äôs a grand total of $140 every two weeks. So I‚Äôve been avoiding going to the doctors because I really cannot afford it. I tried using Monistat ($16) because that worked the last time I was yeasty. It didn‚Äôt work this time. 

My male sexual partner has insurance so I suggested that he go to Planned Parenthood to get an STI test done just for us to be safe. He did and he came up clean, but he also went out of his way to ask about yeast infections while he was there. 

Planned Parenthood explained the complications of yeast infections and that sometimes it needs a medicine to clear it up. He also asked Planned Parenthood about payment. Based on my income, the visit AND treatment would be under $30. I can afford that easily. I made my appointment despite only have 2 cents in my bank account. 

I made my appointment online. It was so easy that I did it during my ecology lecture. It was a little weird having ‚ÄúPlanned Parenthood‚Äù pop up on my phone screen, my professor probably thinks I‚Äôm pregnant now. But overall it took maybe 7 minutes.

I had my appointment yesterday morning and it went literally so well. My male partner brought me. Everyone working  there was female! I had two young females assist me. They spoke to me like a real person with a real issue, and they really empathized with me. (Because all vaginas have maintenance issues at one point or another). We talked about birth control, yeast, diabetes, college, and I felt zero judgement. They got their samples and ran their tests. The yeast infection was positive, and they gave me medicine right there on the spot. One for now, and one for later. The best part was I didn‚Äôt pay a dime! Since I have 2 cents in my bank account, and because I make about $130 a every two weeks, they had me fill out an insurance application, and now I will be covered by insurance for the visit. I can even go online to complete the insurance application and be insured for a longer amount of time!

It was a really great experience for me. Knowing that I can go there for some of my medical issues makes me feel empowered and in control of my finances and health.

Edit: Wow! I just wanted to share my experience. I never expected this to make the front page! Like, this is my second post ever, that's crazy to me! Thanks for everyone who commented support and care. And thanks for everyone who reached out through DM. I've read a lot of reddit posts talking about how to care and treat yeast infections, and tons more talking about the services that Planned Parenthood offers. I wanted to give more validity to those great services and I think it's great that you all have shared home remedies that have worked for you! Now other people like me can come back to the comments on this post when they may not know what else to do.

They told me it's common not to file with insurance at this point, but here's the catch: I either file a police report (I know there will be no evidence because I waited too long and I'm not sure I want to go through all that) in hopes of getting at least some of my medical bills covered, or I file with insurance and pay $2000+. This doesn't include prescriptions. I decide to take all the available prophylactics because I don't know whether the person had anything or not. My HIV prophylactic alone was going to be several hundred dollars even after insurance (I ended up being able to use a coupon to cover my copay). However, my HIV meds are making me incredibly nauseated. So I pay to go to the doctor and they prescribe five days worth of anti-nausea meds (I'm on my other meds for 28 days, just fyi). I go to fill the prescription and insurance only approved two days. Two. I asked about the cash price for the meds and even the generic was going to be about $70 - just for the 5 days.

1553168630.0,"The worst, most backward day of my life","I‚Äôm 20 years old and a sophomore in college. I didn‚Äôt get my period yet this month so over the weekend I decided to take a pregnancy test and it turns out I‚Äôm pregnant. I knew I was going to terminate the pregnancy immediately since I‚Äôm in no position to care for a child at this point in my life. I called my boyfriend, my parents, and my best friend, and they were all supportive of my decision. After crying and getting over the shittiness of the situation, I made an appointment for a non surgical (medical) abortion. The appointment was for today, so this morning I called an Uber (I don‚Äôt have a car on campus) and headed to the clinic which was an hour away. 

My Uber driver seemed immediately uncomfortable and asked if we were going to a planned parenthood. I said no (which was the truth), we were just going to a doctors appointment. Still, he seemed uncomfortable. ‚ÄúIs it an abortion clinic?‚Äù The color drained from my face; how could he know? I just put the address of the doctor in, and there was nothing in the name that would imply it was an abortion clinic.  He stared at me, waiting for an answer, but I was too shocked to reply. I couldn‚Äôt believe this was happening, and now I was trapped in the car with this guy for the next hour. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to regret this decision for the rest of your life.‚Äù He started telling me about the procedure, what it was like, telling me how horrible it was. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much they don‚Äôt tell you. You‚Äôre making a mistake‚Äù. He brought up his wife, who was 5 months pregnant, but trailed off. I just sat there in silence. We were driving through rural land, miles from any kind of house or storefront. I prayed he wouldn‚Äôt hurt me.

We got about halfway there when he suddenly pulled over on the side of the road. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt take you any farther than this. You won‚Äôt find another Uber out here. I can take you back if you want.‚Äù I politely declined and got out of the car. I immediately started calling local taxi companies and asked if they could pick me up. My phone gave me a rough location which I gave them as my pickup address. My Uber driver waited around for about 15 minutes, assuming I‚Äôd change my mind. I insisted I was fine and that he should go back and he eventually left. After waiting about 25 minutes, the cab showed up and I got to my appointment (an hour late).

Even thinking about this experience brings tears to my eyes. I can‚Äôt believe someone would be this cruel. An abortion is already traumatic enough, and not at all a decision I take lightly. That an older man would corner me and confront me about decisions that are none of his business are astounding. I contacted Uber and I can only pray they take appropriate action. 

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your kind words! The thousands of internet hugs have made a huge difference. I reported him to Uber, and Uber got back to me and refunded the ride and said they were ‚Äúreviewing his account‚Äù. I hope to God he‚Äôs fired. 

For all the people who say I deserved this kind of treatment, I have nothing to say to you. I come from a politically conservative family, so I understand being pro life and disagreeing with my decision to terminate my pregnancy. However, the driver was aware of my decision to get an abortion within 10-15 minutes of picking me up from all his probing questions. If he wasn‚Äôt comfortable driving me to the clinic, why continue to drive me there until we were stranded? Was it an impulsive decision to leave me by the side of the road, or was it premeditated after he understood our destination? He easily could have left me in my small city and I would have been able to get a different Uber driver and avoided the whole fiasco that ensued. Or, as others have pointed out, he could have simply declined the ride if the destination (and my decision to exercise my rights) were that offensive to him. 

I have no issue with him (or anyone else) having a different opinion or with him disagreeing with my choices. But your beliefs do not give you the right to make me feel uncomfortable when I‚Äôm completely vulnerable and am relying on you to perform a service I desperately need. 

I‚Äôm debating posting something in r/legaladvice because I fear the possibility that this could happen again with another young woman (or man) who happened to be doing something or was about to engage in a behavior he personally deemed objectionable. Who else has he stranded, and who else will be stranded yet? 

If there are further developments I will update all of you! Again, thank you so much for your kind words and encouragement. I had no idea my post would blow up like this and it makes me feel good knowing people of the internet have my back. You guys are awesome and this subreddit is amazing. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 

Also: thank you kind Redditors for the gold, silver and platinum!! I will make sure this never happens to someone else again.

Update 2: As I commented below, the reason my parents or boyfriend couldn‚Äôt drive me is because they both live in North Carolina while I go to school in New York. My boyfriend couldn‚Äôt afford to buy a last minute flight to see me, and because I live in a dorm room with a roommate, there would have been no place for him to stay. My parents did manage to get a last minute flight, but they didn‚Äôt get one in time to take me to my appointment. ",TwoXChromosomes

1540749396.0,UPDATE: My husband is not bonding with our 5 week old son.,"Last night I called the firestation and talked to a firefighter about my husbands strange behavior since our son was born. With my husbands history of head trauma, he was a boxer from 12 to 28, I was concerned. They sent an ambulance.

The paramedics evaluated him and told me something wasn't right. They decided to take him to the hospital. We've been there all night while my husband was getting scanned and tested. They did all kinds of tests involving memory, they used flashcards, and mental quizzes and puzzles.

I'm in shock as to how bad my husband's mental state is. It's embarrassing I didn't notice how far he had declined. Maybe I didn't want to notice? Maybe it was a conscious decision? 

I watched him struggle name his hometown. He had lived there the first 22 years of his life. He couldn't do it. Mother's name, father's name. He struggled with answering the most basic questions.

I had noticed in recent years he talked about the past less and less. He rarely tells stories about his past anymore. I didn't know that it was because he, basically, doesn't have a past anymore. All those pictures around the house hold no real meaning for him. He doesn't remember our first kiss, when he proposed to me, or very much about our wedding. He knows these things happened, but the specifics of those events are lost to him.

A psychiatrist met with him, but she wasn't very helpful. She kept asking him about suicide. My husband isn't suicidal. She asked him misleading questions like she was trying to trick him into being suicidal. When I brought up how my husband hasn't bonded with our son she waved me off and told me she had rounds.

The neurologist is awesome. He really cares.

My husband's boss and some coworkers came this morning. They were more honest with me today than I think nthey have been in a long time. My husband hasn't been a trainer in 2 years. He used to go and get trained on all thye new JD technology and then train the other techs. It got to the point he couldn't do it anymore. He also has notebooks filled with notes and procedures he should know by heart. They're like his crutches so he can do his job. He rarely goes on field calls alone anymore, he usually takes someone with him. 

I met with a counselor that the neurology department employs to help patient's families deal with the fallout. She told me to prepare to take on more and more of the responsibilities around the house. It's a worry because my husband is the bread winner and I can't replace his income on my skills and education. She explained that patients with the trauma my husband has exist on routine. When something disrupts that routine, like a new baby, they often can't cope.

My husband is staying for a few more days. Tomorrow he meets with a different psychiatrist and then is being transferred to a more advanced neurology center 3 hours away. With a little luck I'll have a more definitive care plan and have him home by Wednesday or Thursday.

1566562691.0,Becoming a mother changed my views on abortion,"I grew up in a pro-life environment. I repeated the ‚Äúlife begins at conception‚Äù line without really understanding it. Then I got married and started trying to get pregnant and I learned a lot more about how female reproduction works. 

I struggled with low fertility, so I began researching to see if there was anything I could do to improve our chances of conceiving. I learned that sometimes it‚Äôs not a problem of getting the egg fertilized, it‚Äôs a problem getting the fertilized egg to implant. I learned about ‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù AKA chemical pregnancy when a fertilized egg (blastocyst) implants and begins to raise the pregnancy hormones, but then is shed in the following period. Normally a woman wouldn‚Äôt even suspect that she had been briefly pregnant, but someone trying to conceive might catch it on an early response home pregnancy test. 

In the middle of all of this new information that I was trying to absorb to figure out how to have a baby, I kept coming back to the ‚Äúlife begins at conception‚Äù line that I‚Äôd been taught all my life. I decided that it must be wrong because if pregnancy doesn‚Äôt begin at conception (there‚Äôs an average of 6-12 days between conception and implantation which I had been previously unaware of), then life doesn‚Äôt either. So I began opening my mind to birth control that prevents implantation and accepted that that was probably a reasonable way to allow women to have some control over their fertility. (This might sound obvious, and it should be, but for someone who believes that life begins at conception, preventing implantation is still ending that life, and I was taught that the birth control pill was just another form of abortion.)

Praise the Lord, I finally got pregnant. Then a whole new nightmare awaited me. Pregnancy SUCKS!!!! In addition to the myriad physical discomforts, there‚Äôs also the mental strain. Your body no longer feels like yours. Everything becomes about the baby. Everything you eat or don‚Äôt eat (and how much!) revolves around what is best for the baby. Everything you do or don‚Äôt do has to be evaluated in the context of what is best for the baby. Then there‚Äôs the hormones. Besides the usual moodiness and volatility, I also suffered from pregnancy-related depression. I felt like a prisoner in my mind and body. 

The only thing that got me through was thinking of this precious baby that I wanted so much and had worked so hard to get.  This brought me back to the abortion question. How inhumane is it to force this on another person who doesn‚Äôt want it and doesn‚Äôt intend to keep the baby! I‚Äôd always heard it discussed as, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kill the baby! Just go through with it and give it up for adoption!‚Äù As if carrying a baby to term is no big deal. 

I began to really question whether the real purpose was to punish the woman for getting pregnant in the first place, and it didn‚Äôt take me long to decide that was definitely part of it. ‚ÄúIf she didn‚Äôt want a baby, she shouldn‚Äôt have gotten pregnant in the first place.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe this will teach her to be more responsible.‚Äùetc.. (Disclaimer: I‚Äôve never personally known someone who got pregnant and wanted an abortion and was prevented from getting one, though I imagine that situation is about to become much more common. These are generic comments that I‚Äôve heard during discussions about abortion in general, rather than things I‚Äôve heard said about a specific person.)

That was all that it took to change my mind about early abortions. I have since had another baby and I kind of agree with some arguments I‚Äôve read that there is hardly any personhood or consciousness in a newborn baby. That doesn‚Äôt mean that I support partial birth abortion, but I have moved my goalposts from ‚Äúokay in the first trimester‚Äù to ‚Äúokay as long as the baby is not viable outside the womb‚Äù. I still believe that life is precious, and I believe that if a pregnancy has progressed to the point of the baby being able to survive outside the womb, then there should be every effort made to allow it to live. [Edit to clarify that I still support having the baby removed if that‚Äôs what the mother wants because it‚Äôs her body, but a viable baby should be given medical care necessary to live the same as any other pre-term baby. I‚Äôm sure this will be a relatively rare situation anyway.] What I no longer believe is that an unborn baby should have equal rights with its mother. An unborn baby is becoming a person, but it‚Äôs not yet. Actual people who have already been born should be prioritized above a person-in-progress.

Having resolved the moral aspect of it for myself, I finally began to understand and be horrified by the ways that denying a woman an abortion could impact her mental health and education and relationships and career. It is inexcusable to me to allow this disproportionate punishment to the woman when she was not alone in conceiving the baby. Add onto that the horror of some people actually arguing against allowing abortions to rape victims, and I finally feel the rage that I‚Äôve seen in other pro-choice people. I finally understand. It‚Äôs barbaric to deny women the *right* to choose what happens to *their own bodies*!

TL/DR: Unlike others I‚Äôve heard who say that becoming a parent made them support abortion less, becoming a parent took me from vehemently pro-life to extremely pro-choice.",TwoXChromosomes

And by slow, I mean in bed. Besides that, we had plenty of time to spend together and talk about practically everything that came to mind. I'm really happy I found someone that listens and has no fear of expressing himself.

We have decided to move forward in this adventure and even though it's a bit early we've decided to start a relationship. We thought that if we have the same feelings towards each other and since we're far from being teenagers it would be illogical to wait longer to make a decision.

That being said, as you may recall, my man had 0 experience with women, yet he told me he had a history of rejection since he was very young.

That has made him somewhat insecure and a bit fearful in sex matters.

Every time things escalated, his penis wouldn't become erect, but I made sure to tell him that it was ok and pretty much normal. So we did some other sexual things instead and still had fun. Sometimes even just cuddling was fine by me.

One day though, he had no trouble whatsoever, and I told him jokingly ""may I take a bit of advantage of you?"", and he answered ""yes, as much as you like"". 

So I got on top of him and we finally did it! It was beautiful and sensual and we hugged and kissed for a while after it.

He's truly thankful for my patience and for treating him lovingly, but I just can't imagine another way of doing things.

1615352846.0,Piers Morgan is a public example of why women are afraid to say no to men.,"Notable observations and timeline of events:

1) **His hatred of Meghan stems from rejection.** 

According to Piers in 2018, he really liked Meghan Markle and spent time getting drinks with her one night. That same night she met Harry at a party and then ""ghosted"" Piers ever since.
 
2) **He was continuously given a platform to spew hatred about Meghan.** 

Piers spent YEARS vilifying Meghan on television and in tabloids. He more recently accused her of lying about being suicidal after she admitted the public bullying from UK tabloids negatively impacted her mental health. Yet, it took only a few SECONDS of criticism to send Piers storming off of his own show in a fit of rage.

3) **It took another man standing up for Meghan to finally get Piers off the air.** 

Despite 40,000+ complaints from viewers about Piers after his diatribe accusing Meghan and Harry of lying in their interview with Oprah, it took his male co-host confronting Piers on air to finally shut him up. His co-host defended Meghan's right to cut off contact with Piers, which angered him and sent him storming off the show. According to the network, despite the complaints and his repeated vicious behavior toward Meghan, he was still given the opportunity to step down on his own volition.

1562978197.0,You just don't know until it happens to you,"In February, I (32 f) was at a gas station after work and saw a guy knock his girlfriend out. He did it in front of everyone at a busy gas station in Baltimore.

Without thinking, I jumped out of my car and screamed at the guy to get the fuck away from her unconscious body. He immediately tried to pick her up and apologize, but when I started to call the cops, he swung at me. Grazed my jaw.

I got in my car and locked the doors. I tried to take video, but I couldn't while on the phone with the police. So I took as many pictures as I could.

This man dragged her body to his car, shook her awake, and made her come and tell me to stop calling the cops. I didn't. So, then, he tried to break into my passenger side door. I backed up to leave, so then he sat on the hood of my car. I managed to drive off without running him over (despite the desire).

Shocking, yes? But, wait, there's more. The majority of my call with 911 during the incident was arguing whether I was in Baltimore City or County. I lived in that neighborhood and knew it was in the city. Still, she transferred me to the county dispatch.

County police arrived and said it was city. But was able to pull his license plate info to help me identify him. After about an hour, the city police arrived, took a report, told me that I need to file charges, and said he will check out the surveillance footage.

I assumed that the state would pursue this incident automatically. I assumed my photos and the surveillance footage would be enough for the state to file charges related to assaulting his girlfriend, assaulting me, trying to break into my car, trying to intimidate me, etc. I assumed the evidence would be damning that I wouldn't have to do anything else. I assumed wrong.

I had to file an assault charge. Me. I had to show up to court as the plaintiff. Me. I had to bring up to the prosecutor the fact that he was already on probation/parole for a previous assault charge. Me. I had take 3 days off work for the district court hearing, the initial circuit court hearing, and the trial. Me. I was the sole witness because no surveillance footage was acquired (for reasons unknown). Me.

Today was the trial. And, about 30 minutes ago, I got the call from the court that he was found guilty. He will be sentenced next Friday.

I bring this all up not because I want to brag about how I put an abuser behind bars. (Ironically, my current job before I go off to law school is providing civil legal services to people who are incarcerated. And, I don't see jail or prison as the best option for many). I bring this up because I never truly understood what it meant for someone to press charges against an abuser. Until now.

It means navigating a system that is tragically overwhelmed and jaded. It means having one of the worst things that has happened to you be treated like a day at the DMV.

Going to court the first time, I had to wait in the hall alongside this man. The second time, I had to pass him twice in the hall to find out I was supposed to be across the street in a completely different building for victims and witnesses. No one told me this. The third time, I was waiting alone in the hall for my moment to testify while they were on break. And, he walked past me in the hall back into the court room.

Each of those times, I felt myself reeling. The term revictimized had a more profound meaning. Not to mention how I had to endure being cross examined by his attorney, who was trying her hardest to make my story seem as if I was the instigator in my assault.

The thing is that I was not especially injured. I did not know this man. And, I feel confident that our paths will never cross again.

But, all I could do was imagine what this experience is like for victims of rape, domestic violence, or something else more violent and personal. The courage it takes to go through all this when the stakes are even higher is underappreciated. And, the reality of not wanting to file charges and not wanting to go through all this is overzealously criticized.

To all of you out there who have had to stand up and fight, I hear you and applaud you. And, I'm sorry you had to go through it, especially if you had to do it all alone. Having someone there to hold your hand makes all the difference.

To all of you out there who did not pursue action, I hear you too. I get why people don't report or take action. And, I'm sorry our system doesn't support you better.

For those of you who have asked for a link or proof that this is the truth, I have two things to say to you:

1. I understand wanting to get more information, but if your motivation is to verify my story (as some have overtly stated), you are part of the problem. Many victims don't report because of the fear of not being believed.

2. I already feel that I have provided too much information that a reasonable person could do this on their own. In fact, I'm a little worried that this post has gotten so much attention that if someone were to find the offender's information from the case docket, they'd be harassed, which may result in further violence or harassment on my part or another.

1627998500.0,My illness was misdiagnosed as anxiety for years. I am now in a wheelchair at 27.,"After seeing a couple of similar stories on here I thought I'd share my own story about being misdiagnosed with anxiety for years.

Since about 2017 I've been having a myriad of bizarre symptoms. Random numbness, nerve pain (sometimes severe), exhaustion so severe I've had to quit my job, intense brain fog, vision problems leaving me at times unable to see in my right eye, tingling in my limbs, slurred speech to the point where I've been accused of being drunk, plus other strange and frightening things.

I've seen around 4 different Doctors over the years about these issues. Every single time I would be diagnosed with anxiety and essentially felt as though I was considered a hysterical hypochondriac. At one point a Doctor told me the reason for all my symptoms was because 'driving makes some people anxious, and you drive nearly every day.' Yep. Apparently having immense pain in my back and neck, losing vision in my eye, slurring my speech, and everything else I've experienced is because I drive a car.

That was about 18 months ago. I went home feeling humiliated and stupid. I gave up and have never tried to get a diagnosis again.... Maybe I was just crazy. 

That was until a couple of weeks ago when I woke up with completely numb feet. I wasn't scared though, I was used to it. I've dealt with this shit for years and this was just yet another instance of my body being weird. Hoping it would be gone by the next day I ignored it, only to wake up the day after to find that I had completely lost feeling from the chest down. 

I went to hospital where I stayed for over a week, and long story short I was diagnosed with a condition called transverse myelitis caused by an 'acute' Multiple Sclerosis flair up. 

They did MRI scans on my brain and spine. Some of the many lesions I had were very old, which, according to the neurologist, means that I have likely had MS for years. 

Although once diagnosed with my kind of MS there's no way of entirely eliminating the chances of a relapse, there are treatments available and precautions one can take which mean that relapses are less likely to happen and less severe. Because I was undiagnosed and untreated for literally years and have had a severe relapse, I have been in a wheelchair since my diagnosis and I have no idea if I will ever be able to walk normally ever again. I am 27 and I am in a fucking wheelchair. I can't feel ANYTHING below my chest except nerve pain and constant, awful pins and needles. 

I've spoken to 2 male friends since my diagnosis. One with epilepsy, and one with MS. Both of my male friends, even the one with MS- who had almost identical symptoms to me, were referred to neurologists immediately. No 'you're anxious because you drive a car' bullshit. 

So to any women out there being dismissed by health professionals as I was for fucking years- I feel you. I don't know what else to say except that I am heartbroken and furious that so many of us keep having to go through being labelled as essentially 'hysterical women' when we know we aren't. Not being believed is devastating when you can feel your brain and body failing. 

Sorry this is poorly written. I actually have an English Degree but the MS has seemingly robbed me of the ability to think straight enough to write as well as everything else.

EDIT: Thank you all SO MUCH for the support. I'm sitting here with tears in my eyes reading through everything. I know I will keep coming back to read these lovely comments when I have a bad day. I'm also so, so sorry to hear all these stories from other women- I feel so lucky that my illness is not life threatening.

Please don't worry about giving me any more awards :)

For those of you that don't believe me - thank you for proving my point. 

Finally - I was diagnosed less than 2 weeks ago. Please do not PM me asking if I think you or your loved one has MS or what advice I can give you. My heart really goes out to you but I really am in no position to advise.

This happened yesterday, the day of an excessively important meeting in which I needed to convince the executive team at my company that the website I manage should be the next one in line to get a redesign.

Incidentally, the ol' uterus had done me the favor of double-booking my day with the initiation of its monthly lining-purge, and for the better part of the morning I found myself wincing as it crampily complained about how pregnant I wasn't.

About an hour prior to the meeting, I felt a familiar but unpleasant sensation in my nether regions and suspected that I might have sprung a leak. I hastily excavated a tampon from my satchel and, lacking pockets, tucked it into my bra to prevent my coworkers from seeing it as I hustled to the bathroom.

It turned out to be a phantom leak, so all business proceeded as usual, and the tampon in my bra remained unused. Unfortunately, by the time I made my way back to my office, schmoozing with the occasional coworker on the way, I had entirely forgotten that it was there.

As the meeting time approached, I was feeling confident. I had done my research, assembled a glorious and stylish presentation with rock-solid data to support my argument, rehearsed my spiel, and psyched myself up with some assertive body language exercises. I had this. Immovable decision-makers, meet unstoppable go-getter.

I strutted into the meeting ready to win the day. Distributing habitually firm handshakes to the white-haired businessmen around the conference table with a jaunty joke here and there, I made my way to the front of the room and started hooking my laptop up to the projector.

To my endless dismay, that was the moment my hidden tampon decided to make an appearance. It had slipped out of my bra, and I felt it graze my belly as it plummeted toward hem of my loose-fitting shirt.

If I had been thinking, I might have let it drop to the floor and kicked it under the table where it would have most likely gone unnoticed until the end of the meeting. But no such luck.

Instead, I tried to catch it as it fell out of my shirt.

And instead of catching it, I swatted it -- an impeccable under-hand serve that sent my tampon soaring, with all the grace of a badminton birdie, directly into the center of the oak conference table, where it landed with a loud *phlatt*.

All eyes in the room descended upon it as the smalltalk came to a record-scratching halt. Then all eyes turned upon me. A years-long silence followed in which I prayed for a sudden aneurysm.

Suddenly remembering how to move, I lunged across the table and snatched it up.

In an uncharacteristic fit of charm, I grinned, raised the tampon up to the projection like a pointer, and said, ""Now that I have your undivided attention, let's get started.""

Fortunately, that was enough to make one of them chuckle. Despite the deep discomfort on some of their faces, the laugh broke the spell and allowed me to proceed with the presentation.

And all-in-all, the presentation went well, and I was approved for my redesign. So it could have been far worse.

But that won't stop my scumbag brain from kicking me with that particular memory every time I'm trying to fall asleep for the next month or so.

TL;DR Silenced a room full of my company's old male executives by flopping my tampon on the conference table.

Edit: The exec who laughed just popped into my office to ask what I'm planning to throw at them today. I'm never going to live this down.

1495577927.0,I finally called a man out on the bus for touching me,"So I've always been a somewhat shy girl. I live in a big city where buses can get pretty crowded because of either rush hour or just nearby schools getting let out. Cool. I understand crowded buses; we all gotta get where we're going after all. But what I can't understand is why some men feel the need to take advantage of crowds to feel up other people's bodies.

The first time I was inappropriately touched was in 8th grade.  

It was a really crowded bus as the middle school I went to was near other schools that happened to get out at the same time. The bus stopped at one of the main bus station so naturally, many people got off and there was a lot of bustling as half the bus fought their way to the door. I thought nothing of it until I felt someone's fingers roughly shove their way into my crotch from behind. By the time I had turned around, the person was lost in the wave of people getting off. I was literally the shyest I have ever been in my life at that time (was voted the shyest girl in the school that year actually) and so I never said anything to anyone.

The second time was on yet another crowded bus, a couple years into high school. This old Chinese man was holding onto my upper arm from behind which I was using to hold onto a strap above for balance and I thought it was a little weird but just assumed that he had nothing else to hold onto for balance so I shrugged it off as nothing. At least, until his hand reached down and started grasping at my right boob. Luckily, I was with my best friend this time who had gotten a hold of a seat and squeezed me in with her. The man got off at the next stop. We said nothing except for a few comments of disgust.

The third time, which happened a year later, didn't really involve me being touched sexually but was more creepy than anything. I was boarding a the bus with the same friend and as I stepped on, I could feel a guy pressed up close behind me. I thought this was very strange as the bus wasn't anywhere near crowded enough to justify that and the man kept this up as we got on until my friend and I were standing holding onto straps for support as we chatted. Now at this point the man had backed off a little, just enough that he was still there but not enough for anyone to go wtf at him. My friend and I were talking quietly about something about which stop to get off at, the man swaying with the bus to casually make contact with my back the whole time. Keep in mind this bus is not crowded by any means; my friend and I had chosen to stand because our stop was nearby. As we got off, the man made a remark, breaking into our conversation about something we were discussing. I later complained about this to another friend and halfway into describing the man, she quickly cut me off and finished the description for me. Apparently the man was hanging out near a mall next to a highschool and had been coming up to highschool girls and trying to give them his number. This was a young blond male in his 20s(?).

A couple hours ago, I was riding the bus home from my old highschool where I was visiting a retiring teacher. It was an extremely crowded bus because the same line ran though at least a couple schools and a few stops away from where I was supposed to get off, I gave up my seat for an elderly man and started standing by the rear exit. Not a minute later, I felt fingers stroking my left butt cheek. I thought it was my imagination at first so I shrugged slightly away only to feel the fingers return. I was 100% sure those weren't some stray bag at that point; those were human fingers stroking from my lower to upper butt. 

I was done. I'd gained confidence in highschool thanks to mentioned teacher and I was sick and tired of being touched. I've gotten nothing but trouble from guys in college who just can't take a damn hint. I was called a bitch for not giving them a chance (I have a boyfriend) so I did what I felt was right. I called him out on it.

I turned to him, looked the middle age blond man straight in those sky blue eyes of his and said in the loudest voice I could manage, ""Touch my butt one more time and I will report you."" I knew I had the right man. He met my gaze unblinkingly and slowly nodded. No one seemed to have paid attention or cared. But at that moment, I was relieved.

When I got off, I found out that my sister was on the same bus and had squeezed onto the front of the bus. If she had gotten on the back door, my little sister could have been in my position instead. She could have been the one touched instead of me. And I know she wouldn't have said a thing.

I know this isn't a big deal to many people but I had to get it out somewhere. Thank you for reading.

TL;DR Guy kept stroking my butt, I called him out on it, and my little sister could have been his victim instead of me if she had gotten on the back door instead of front.

Edit: Ahh thank you! I honestly only expected a few upvotes and a comment or two perhaps so I was honestly surprised when I came back... And only one nasty PM to boot! Thank you so much!

1595853778.0,"Never share your nudes with anyone, men are putting them up on websites sorted by location and by college, even including names","My friend sent me a disturbing TikTok video today where a girl exposes a website men have been using to share nudes of women local to their area. I went on the board to my state and on the front page I saw one of my sister‚Äôs friends, a girl I have known since she was 10 and I know would never post something like that publicly. Her name and face was included in all pics with men requesting more from whatever asshole was sharing them. I went to my local college page and after going through a 2 pages I saw 3 girls I recognized. I had to stop after that because I felt nauseous.

The posts include both location and names as well, incredibly personally identifying information that sometimes had a social media handle. There are town specific threads. All the posts were of women, there were posts requesting women, even of mothers and married women.

Women need to stop sharing nudes, even if you don‚Äôt include your face in them they will still post a picture of your face above them in their sick threads. No matter how a guy tries to convince or manipulate you into sending them, even if it‚Äôs on Snapchat, do not send them. You have no idea if you will end up on a website like this no matter what you think of the guy you‚Äôre sending it to.

I‚Äôm not going to post the website, it‚Äôs been scrubbed but mirror sites of it are still active. I also don‚Äôt want any men who lurk here to know of it. There is a petition going around to have the website taken down permanently and there are legal actions you can take if you find yourself on the website. Stay safe out there.

Two of the mirrors I know are down for maintenance and ‚Äúmembers only‚Äù and one is also trapped behind a paywall even though 1 hour ago they were open for anyone to see. Looks like they are trying to lock down their operation before the movement against it gets too much traction

Edit 5: To all the concerned women messaging me, I will be answering all of your PMs. Some of the women who did message me have found their pics on the sites before they were locked out by the site owners. In light of this, I am still sharing the links with users I can verify are women (I will NOT be sharing with any men) for you to have in case they do open the sites back up. Please PM me if you would still like the links and I‚Äôll send you instructions on what I need to verify you are a women and how I will send these links to you. For now I‚Äôm taking a break from answering PMs but I will get back to everyone today or tomorrrow.

The only thing is I seem to have hit some sort of chat limit and now I‚Äôm unable to respond to anymore chats people send me today. PMs are still working but I am just going to post the instructions on my profile and pin it so you don‚Äôt need to go through the chat feature to reach me. I will still be vetting obviously. I am also planning on compiling a guide from suggestions in the comments of what to do if you find your pic on one of these sites and will work on it this week and send it to those who PM‚Äôd me. Lastly, I just want to thank the incredible women who have shared their stories and worries with me over their pictures appearing on one of these sites. The sheer amount women who have this anxiety is staggering, I just want to say in all likelihood you aren‚Äôt on these sites, but even if you are it‚Äôs not a reflection on you. It‚Äôs a reflection on the sick fucks who could betray someone‚Äôs trust so flippantly, and I hope they rot in hell. I also hope everyone pushes your local politicians on revenge porn laws so that women don‚Äôt have to suffer the anxiety and ramifications of having their nude images shared without consent online.

After 36 hours of them not being able to figure out how to file with my insurance (you know, the uncommon Bcbs insurance...), I left. The only thing they had done was draw my blood to see if I had been drugged (dr didnt even read the results. Just told me it came back clean when it didnt...) and have me sleep on a mat in a coed psych waiting room.

I don‚Äôt have to do all the emotional labor. I don‚Äôt have to do jack shit for him. I feel absolutely nothing for him and all of his sobbing and snot and apologies.

I feel SO free.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is just relief or dissociation, though. So I‚Äôm gonna join a gym, eat healthy, buy some new panties and upgrade my ancient hitachi magic wand. Any advice or recommendations are appreciated!




Edit: I really can‚Äôt express how much your words mean to me. I am so sorry so many of you have gone/are going through this pain. Thank you all so much!

To touch on a few common questions, he‚Äôs slept on a recliner for two days. As much as I‚Äôd like to throw him out and serve him with divorce papers today, I really have to be cautious for now so that he‚Äôll continue to be cooperative. I am 100% sure we‚Äôll be divorced, though. I‚Äôm looking into therapy for myself and my two kids and contact a lawyer ASAP. I have no intention of dating anyone until all of this is over and I‚Äôve had a shit ton of therapy.

For the handful of people who cared about his reasoning (and I sure as fuck don‚Äôt) he said he felt old and fat. He hates himself and any attention he got from these women was an ego boost. Every time we talk now he cries.  He sobs and I feel just completely emptiness in the part of me that used to care. I suspect maybe it has something to do with his diabetes, super low testosterone, and ED. But again, not my problem.

I bought the cute undies and Satisfyer 2 Pro plus. I‚Äôm looking into the other vibes mentioned. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm gonna have the best sex of my life with myself soon!

Edit 2: The comment about the testosterone really upset a couple guys. I never shamed him about his health problems, if anything I was too accommodating. So I‚Äôll give you an example of how exhausting the relationship was. He never gave himself the shots. Whatever, some people don‚Äôt like needles. I‚Äôd give him the shot then he‚Äôd be cranky with me for the rest of the night because his leg hurt. He‚Äôd say I did it wrong this time.

His medicine would expire, I‚Äôd mention it, and he wouldn‚Äôt go to the doctor for a refill. On and on, over and over. He wouldn‚Äôt let me give him the shot unless he felt absolutely terrible. Now imagine the situation I mentioned repeating in every other facet of our lives. He wasn‚Äôt always like this. But this is who he is now.

Edit 3: I‚Äôm going to make an appointment for an STD check. Ugh.
The only reason I found out is because he gave me his phone to charge. It was sitting right next to my tablet in my field of vision when a message popped up.

I had recently broken up with my long term boyfriend and a good friend of mine invited me to come to a party in her city for a night out to get my mind off things. I was a very inexperienced drinker, had a few too many drinks before even leaving for the bar and opted to stay back at her place. 

She lived in an apartment with a few other girls, and one of the girls boyfriend and his friends also stayed back to have a few more drinks before going to the bar. 

I was in my friends room and could clearly hear the group of guys (I think there was at least 3), discussing how they should rape me before going to the bar. They talked about how they might strike out with the girls at the bar, and they wanted to make sure they got an ‚Äòeasy lay‚Äô before they headed out. 

At that point I realized I had to do something. I was in my friends room, I didn‚Äôt have my phone near me and I honestly panicked. At that point I jumped up and locked the door, I moved whatever furniture I could possibly move to block the door. 

They guys were banging on the door, yelling that I needed to come out for some fun. 

They weren‚Äôt able to get in and eventually they gave up and left. But I often think about what would happen if I didn‚Äôt move. 

It‚Äôs really disturbing to hear a group of twenty something men, openly discuss raping a woman.

I was in my 20s before someone said ""oh is she a doctor?""","I think this was the big eye-opener for me; the first of many events that showed me the subtle sexism rampant in the world.    


I was chatting with friends while my mom was in the kitchen when the ""where does she work?"" question came up.  When I responded and the followup was ""is she a doctor?"", I distinctly remember my mom setting down what she was working on, looking my friend directly in the eye, and saying ""thank you"" to her in an utterly serious and sincere tone.  I was confused as to why until I asked her about it that evening.  It had never occurred to me that time and time again, people just assumed that she wasn't a doctor.    


For reference, she wasn't a nurse or a doctor, but the lead tech in the blood lab.  Obviously we'd never expect someone to randomly guess that, but the fact that it took over 20 years for someone to guess doctor instead of nurse was, in hindsight, tremendously depressing.    


I've unfortunately lost contact with the friend who asked this, but if you happen to be reading this...thank you.  That one simple question had an impact more profound on me than you intended, I'm sure, and it certainly made my mom's day.  


(And I want to be very clear here: I have *tremendous* respect for nurses.  I could never do their job, and in the times I've needed their services in emergency situations I have been beyond grateful for their skills and talents.

1607175385.0,The time my male friend actually realized how regularly women get harassed just walking down the street.,"This happened a few years ago, but I often feel the need to post this story in various comments, so I'd figure I'd make my own post. 

I used to play in a metal band. I'm the only woman member in that band. We were playing a gig in a seedier side of a city, and I wanted to hit up a liquor store to grab a drink before we played (dry venue.) I asked one of my band mates to walk with me for the 2 blocks to the store. He was a bit annoyed cause it was right there, but agreed cause all he had to do was make a phone call and he could do that at the same time. 

He's walking several paces behind me cause he's on an important phone call. We didn't look like we were walking together. 

Now I will say for shows, I like to dress up a little. Maybe a torn up shirt and thick leggings with boots. 2 guys came walking down the side walk from the other direction, and split so I was in the middle. 

""Hey baby, I like your outfit."" ""Where you going, you look sexy as fuck."" I felt one of their fingers actually reach out and touch my waist through one of the tears in my shirt. 

I kept eyes forward, mouth closed, and kept walking. ""Fine, fuck you, bitch."" As they kept walking the other way. 

My band mate came up next to me (having ended his call.) Convo went like so:

Him: ""hey, you knew those guys, right?""

Me: ""nope. Complete strangers.""

Him: ""what the fuck? Did they actually touch you?""

Me: ""Yup. This happens literally all the time to any woman that walks down the street alone. Why do you think I asked one of you guys to come with me?""

His eyes just widened. It's like something clicked in his brain. Men don't experience or first hand witness this at the same frequency as women. Even though I didn't acknowledge the guys whatsoever, my bandmates first assumption was that I knew them. 

Needless to say, he walked right next to me on the way back.

She left my dad when I was 7 and let him have custody of us due to her being unable to take care of us. She never asked for anything from him except her freedom. For years he told us she didn‚Äôt love us, and how horrible a person she was. She never contacted us, at least that's what he told us so we believed him. Turns out, he gave her a bunch of ridiculous rules about being in contact with us, and because she felt so much guilt about leaving us and him raising us on his own, she wanted to respect his boundaries and rules. She emailed us many times, but he never told us about any of them (one of the rules my dad had was as long as we were minors, all contact had to be through him, she showed me the emails she sent to us through him).

He was unable to separate his relationship with her from our relationship with her as her children. He thought that the best revenge on her was to make us not love her, because he never stopped to realize that it was his children who were the ones who actually paid the price for his lies. We still loved her, we just hated ourselves.

I know he did his best. He made sure we always had a roof over our head and food in our belly; we went on vacations, never lacked for a lot, monetarily. But he still let us believe that our own mother didn't love us because she was brain damaged and mentally ill, and she wasn't capable of taking care of us financially.

1602210700.0,I'm fucking terrified of Amy Coney Barrett,"This happened nearly ten years ago when I was in high school but I came out to a pastor, He raped me, because it would supposedly make me not gay. I didn't tell anyone because I was too scared of being outed. My parents definitely would have kicked me out.

Two months later, I found out I was pregnant. I didn't know anything about abortion except that it was murder. I didn't have health insurance, and it's not exactly easy to get one as a minor anyways. I was too scared to talk to my parents about it. So I went to the internet to figure out how to force a miscarriage. It took several attempts, and I'll spare the details, but I woke up to a bloody mess that still haunts me.

That pastor is still at my family's church, preaching to vulnerable kids, claiming God loves them, that abortion is wrong, and that i would have deserved to go to hell. I haven't been back since I turned 18, but I still feel extremely guilty about the possibility he's abused anyone else.

I'm now a PhD student in a stem field. I don't think this would have happened if I was forced to have my rapist's child.

Now that RBG is gone, and Amy Coney Barrett is up to replace her, I'm terrified for other people who would have to go through what I went through to get abortions in times of crisis. I feel so hopeless. But I'm going to keep fighting because that's the legacy RBG left behind.

There was another scientist recently who spoke out about her sexual assault during another Supreme Court justice's hearing that did not stop him from being appointed. Reporting, especially years later, rarely, if ever, helps the survivor. And may not keep the perpetrator from remaining in a position of power

Edit 2: I honestly didn't think this would get so much attention. I have been in a bad place lately with everything going on in the world, and just wanted to vent. Even in anonymity, the comments suggesting I'm lying, making this up, trolling, or responsible for my perpetrator's actions because I never reported are starting to get to me. I'll leave this up because I think the discussions are important to have, but please please PLEASE stop dm-img me disgusting messages, leaving vulgar comments, asking me for personal information/proof, or blaming me for what someone else did.

1615986873.0,"A comment on the whole ""How do we make women feel safer in public"" trend on reddit right now","I think one of the problems is that many people imagine that ""making women feel safer in public"" consists of situations where they are the hero or white knight. Beating up the masked rapist who pulled the pretty lady into the bushes, who will in turn be forever grateful and fall in love with you. Chasing off the robber who wanted to steal the nice grandma's handbag. Many versions of saving the damsel in distress. It's natural to want to see yourself like that. It's pretty cool to be the hero.

When in reality ""making women feel safe in public"" is something different 9,5 out of 10 times. It's being ""no fun"" and calling out your male buddies or other men who make misogynist jokes or make women uncomfortable. It's ""cockblocking"" a buddy who wants to take home a drunk girl. It's not hitting on women when it is inappropriate no matter how pretty you find them and how blue your balls are. It's making sure a female friend gets home safely. It's meddling. It's being a nag. Ultimately it's confronting and risking to anger or annoy other men, especially men you like or are friends with and sometimes sacrificing that friendship. It costs something. And it is not rewarded with women being so grateful they reward you with sex. And that is much harder to imagine and do than acting out white knight fantasies.

I had an abortion when I was 22; doesn't matter why. I got pregnant and didnt want to be. I immediately knew what I wanted to do, and terminated with little difficulty.

If i am ever in conversation and the topic of abortion comes up, I usually hear the other person out, and depending on how safe I feel, I relate my experience. 

With Pro-Lifers, it's like I slapped them in the face. I usually say it in a very neutral tone, deadpan expression. 

""I had an abortion.""

This is after they say how people who had abortions are murdering little babies, it's against God, and all that other stuff.

I feel like it IS relevant to say I am a 24 year old white female, and I am happy and nice and helpful and have a good job where have many opportunities to advance.i definitely do think that people have a ""stereotype"" of the people who do get abortions, and I do not fit that picture.

After I drop that little sentence, theyget flustered and embarrassed and try to save face, and usually say something like, ""Well, I'm sure your situation was different.""

""No. I got pregnant and didnt want to be. That's usually the reason most people get abortions,"" I say, and usually people find a reason to salvage what little dignity they have an exit.

I was too scared to call out for help. If I called out for help and it didn't work, he'd be even angrier at me. This was my survival instinct kicking in.

As my husband dragged me in a headlock through the parking lot towards our car, I struggled to escape his grasp, hoping someone would notice and care. 

You noticed, and more importantly, you cared enough to do something.

My husband is a large intimidating man. You are an average, somewhat timid looking man. As you held the hand of your little son, it must have crossed your mind that intervening could be dangerous and would certainly be uncomfortable. 

""Hey! You can't do that dude"". 

Your voice stopped not only my husband in his tracks, but several other nearby patrons. My hope of rescue began to build.

""Fuck off bro, this is my wife"".

My husband quickened his pace. The car was 15 feet away. Fear sunk back into my heart. 

""I don't care who she is, you can't do that.""

My husband was extremely irritated at you. Perhaps even considering assaulting you. But then he started to feel the spotlight that was falling on him. More patrons were paying attention, some in their cars rolling down their window, some stopping in the parking lot to assess the situation.

It was enough. It was all I needed. My husband let go of me, got in the car and was gone. You went on with your day, surely unaware of the impact you just made on my life. 

What you didn't know is that I'd been trapped in the abusive relationship for years and that my husband had become absolutely unhinged in the last couple of days, showing levels of violence and anger I'd never seen in him.

What you didn't know is that for the previous 32 hours he had kept me from my phone, my computer, my car, and any contact with anyone.

The only reason he risked taking me in public was because the income tax return was in my name and he wanted me to cash it for him. I honestly expected him to kill me afterwards.

Minutes after you saved my life, I borrowed another stranger's phone and called the police and my mother. 

Finally, I am free.

Uh. Fuck me, I guess? I'll just jam a cup up there despite my issues with vaginismus, screaming and crying is worth it to save the planet right? People with vulvodynia, very low cervix septate or microperforate hymen, people with trauma, scar tissue or dysphoria should just 'try harder', apparently! Wow. Thanks, we're all cured! /s

And for the people who can't afford to collect cups until they find 'the one', should they just 'try harder' to not be poor, too? 

And for the people with disabilities and mobility issues who physically _can't reach_ or don't have the necessary dexterity? 'Try harder'... To... Not be so disabled? 

I know many people _adore_ their cups, and love to talk about how much it's helped them and educate others about them and I love that! 

But can we just not assume that it's going to be a wonderful experience for everyone? Or that it's necessarily _attainable_ for everyone?

1532737042.0,"I was almost taken/trafficked in Austin, Tx","This is the most traumatizing thing that's ever happened to me. I have never told most people about this and I want to get the word out to other women about how easily this can happen, how quickly you can be caught off guard, and how even safe places can have predators. 

It was terrifyingly similar to the actual movie Taken, but it happened in Austin, Tx. There is a very popular bar district downtown here, it's like a strip and super busy with college kids. I was 21 years old and I was out with my husband and 4 of his friends (all guys). So it was me and 5 decent sized men and this still happened. 

We were all out drinking and having a great time. I had stopped on the busy street in front of one of the bars to talk to a door guy I knew, and my husband and the guys walked off in front of me. I had just said bye to the door guy and I was trailing behind the guys by about 15 feet. I was noticeably drunk, I was stumbling a bit. I'm a small woman, 90 lbs. Suddenly a car pulls over next to me and rolls down the window, it's a charismatic and good-looking guy in his 20s. He goes ""Hey! I'm your uber! Get in"" and unlocks the door. I looked over and felt ever-so-slightly off and went ""No, I didn't call an uber"" and kept walking. The car started rolling along next to me and the guy is saying through the window ""No you didn't call, your friend called. We're here to pick you up. Get in."" And I stopped walking, for the slightest second, and glanced to the car with a funny face. By that point I knew it was weird. It was already happening so fast, maybe 20 seconds went by so far. As soon as my eyes landed on the car, the driver turned to the backseat and said something fast in another language. The backdoor flies open and there are 2 other guys sitting there, about his same age, and they are all eastern-european (maybe greek?) with accents.  My eyes went wide and the guys lunged forward, grabbed me by the waist and yanked me into the car. I was gone and in the car in under a second. I screamed in the loudest, most blood curdling way I could muster, NOOOOOOOO. My husband's best friend about 15 feet ahead hears me first, stops dead in his tracks and starts bolting towards me. The driver starts driving right away and the guys in the back try slamming the door behind me.

They had my wrists but I stuck my leg between the car and the door right before he tried to slam it, so it bounced off my leg and my husband's best friend grabs the door. Then they  pulled my leg in and were able to shut the door and lock it. 

I'm screaming, they're driving away. The rest of my group is running to us, the bouncer we were in front of comes running to me, and him and husband's best friend run after the car a few feet and yank me out of the still open window by my arms, while the car is still moving.  I'm still screaming and kicking. On my way out of the car I kick the driver in the chest. They sped away, turned and were gone.

I'm crying. My husband is crying. The bouncer calls the police to report it. It's a whole scene. I left immediately, I rushed home in a panic and didn't stay around for the report. Don't know if anything ever happened with it. I never gave them my information. I was honestly so traumatized and in a state of shock that I never did anything or told anyone else. My friends that were with me (and my husband primarily) struggled with tremendous guilt for a long time. Nobody felt like they reacted fast enough, or harsh enough, or just that they let me lag behind at all. It changed all of us forever and I'm still terrified of being anywhere alone and of being taken. 

I was 21 and I was basically kidnapped. There were a few seconds I was completely locked in the car and they were driving off, holding me tightly and restraining my limbs. They were talking a foreign language and I knew in that moment 100% that I would be trafficked and thought it would be the last time I ever saw my husband or my friends. 

It was a perfectly normal night in a well-lit, busy, decent area of town and I was with a group of men who would've protected me. And they pounced on me immediately because they thought I was alone. 

Be extremely wary of cab drivers and people claiming they are uber and lyft when you are out. Always confirm on the app that someone is your driver, and never stand too close to cars when you are on the sidewalk. I know that last one may seem paranoid, but if you are in a vulnerable position (I was drunk, dressed sexy, seemingly alone outside of a club), you need to be extremely wary of your surroundings and how quickly the unexpected can happen. 

Please be careful. Please be safe. Please report anything suspicious. Be vigilant. ",TwoXChromosomes

Why? Because it compromises your 'Christian values'. So much for 'What Would Jesus Do'.

I know you never wanted to meet him. I know you never *tried* to meet him. I know you never invited him to any family dinners or events. All because he doesn't believe Jesus was born to save us. I just never thought you would be this cold.

I didn't expect you to not even message me before the wedding. I didn't expect you to not message me after. It's been days.

I didn't expect my guest list to only include my fiance's family and our close friends. 

I never expected not to have a father-daughter dance at the wedding.

I never expected not to have my mom help with choosing flowers, colours, and small details. 

I never expected to tell the photographer to shorten our appointment because my family won't need pictures taken.

I never expected to walk down the aisle alone.

A few stops into the ride, a drunk construction worker barged his way into where we were sitting and threw down his bag of tools and a 6 pack. He started talking to her calling her pretty and trying to convince her that she was hot enough to be a model. I'm somewhat drunk too and none of their conversation with worth my attention. I didn't bat an eye until he commented on her short her skirt was. I muted Netflix and watched her face go from nervous maybe flattered to a little uneasy. While I thought to myself about how inappropriate that comment was, his hand ended up on her knee and her facial expression just dropped. I looked down to see that his finger nails were just under the skirt and recognized what was about to happen. I offered the guy $20 for a beer and he removed his hand and got me a beer. He didn't take the money, but the girl didn't move and stayed put. He went back to talk to her. From reading the threads on here, I recognized that this girl was frozen. So I needed to keep his attention and figured the best way to do it was to ask him what his trade was. He responded and said he's a fireproofer. As he turned back to her, I just blurted out ""Unions suck"". He was not happy about that comment, but I was happy because for the next 15 minutes, his attention was focused on me. Why that girl didn't move for the rest of the train ride, I'll never know, but I knew I did the right thing because she thanked me on her way off the train.

1617801104.0,A doctor tried to make me get an unnecessary procedure and I told him no,"I am trying to get my nexplanon, a birth control arm implant, removed and no provider at my primary care clinic is able to do it, which is a simple outpatient procedure that takes less than 20 minutes to do. To go to my OBGYN clinic to see a provider that can perform the procedure, I need a referral from my primary care clinic, which should not be a big deal.

&nbsp;

This morning I went to my appointment to get my referral and encountered a jerk of a doctor. He interrupted me several times as I tried to explain the reason for my visit and I had to correct him several times as he kept referring to my arm implant as an IUD, which is completely the wrong type of implant. He insisted that in order to get a referral I would have to get a pelvic ultrasound. I've had an arm implant removed before and didn't need a pelvic ultrasound previously, which I tried to explain to the doctor but he interrupted again to say that it's requirement and I wouldn't get a referral without one.

&nbsp; 

Trying to contain my rising frustration, I looked him straight in the eye and said ""No"". I explained once again that I have an arm implant and don't meet any criteria for a pelvic ultrasound. He tried to say that it was a general requirement so I had him pull up the criteria to go through it. Some of the criteria included diagnosed endometrial conditions, fibroids, abnormal bleeding, presence of an IUD, etc. None of which apply to me. After going through the criteria, the doctor was quiet for a second and said the OBGYN clinic would contact me to set up an appointment for an arm implant removal. 

&nbsp;

It was a frustrating experience for sure, but I am happy that I stuck up for myself and told a doctor ""no"". 18 year old me would have been too intimidated to speak up but thanks to others for talking about being their own advocate, like on this sub, I have learned a lot in taking control of my own medical care.

A short preface, so you know the situation: My (f, 30) job requires a lot of international travel. Sometimes for conferences etc., but often also for supervising projects, fieldwork and advisory work, where I stay in the specific place for usually one to three weeks. I am fine with that and like travelling. These trips often take me to places in Africa and the Middle East, so you might imagine where this is going. Another important information is that the institution that employs me pays me pretty well, but is basically Scrooge McDuck when it comes to travel expenses. One consequence of this is that they want us to take public transport (train, bus, subway‚Ä¶) on business trips whenever possible instead of taxis or ubers because it is cheaper and whenever we want to be reimbursed for a taxi ride we need to provide a detailed explanation why that ride was necessary and could not be done via public transport. Annoying but I also never had any problems with it until now.

I just had a pretty big fight with the person working on my travel expense claim for a one week trip to Cairo, Egypt, at the end of last year (so pre-Corona-mess and yes, they are working really slowly right now). Usually a very nice woman handles them and there have never been any problems, but this time I got a call by a new guy, who had been put in charge of it:

‚ÄúI am calling about your travel expense claim for Cairo from last year? There is a problem with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, how can I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt says here you took taxis for pretty much every ride there; you know that we don‚Äôt reimburse that, right? And as an explanation you just wrote ‚Äúpublic safety‚Äù?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Cairo.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever been to Cairo?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not going to take the public bus or subway in Cairo as a 30-year old, visibly European woman travelling alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I value my life, health and safety and I prefer to do my job without getting molested.‚Äù

*Cue a monologue by that guy in which he makes pretty clear that he thinks I am an unreasonable, spoiled, hysterical woman and me getting more and more pissed and asking for his supervisor during it. Until in one of my by now pretty loud answers I say the following:*

‚ÄúDo you really expect me to carry my work-laptop and all the cash (which is a lot, especially by Egyptian standards) I need to pay for the workers and materials in my handbag on a damn bus in Cairo during rush hour?!‚Äù

And suddenly he was quiet. It turns out that the fact that I was carrying a laptop and cash was a totally reasonable explanation to take a taxi for him. My safety was not. He made pretty clear that if hadn‚Äôt been carrying the laptop or cash my request would have been denied as unreasonable.

Fun fact in the end: Taxi rides are dirt cheap in Cairo. Taking them instead of public transport cost around 50$ more, if even that much. That is the amount of money my employer is obviously willing to put me in danger for. Good to know.

&#x200B;

PS: Before anyone gets upset: I would have been able to pay for the taxi rides myself, sure. This wasn't about the 50$ for me. It was about the principle and my employer disregarding my safety.

We went camping. It has been a long since I could. I was so excited. Had everything packed- even meal prepped food for dinner so it was easy to warm up if we had a few too many. Well.... he did. And it got ugly. 

I fell asleep in my hammock around 3. We had a plan- make dinner at 5, then go get more wood bc we were almost out. When I laid down he said he was going to forage for dead wood.  Great. 

I wake up at 5 and there's this HUUUGE fire he built. All proud with a puffed up chest he's like,  ""see all I gathered?"" I look at the ground and there's nothing. I ask if everything on the fire is what he found and he says yes.  Wtf? I tell him I can't put a grate over that (3 feet high with logs that hang over the side with 12 foot flames) and he LOSES IT. 

Decides to leave, angry.  Only thing I said was ""who does this?!"" as he's busy tearing up the tent to get his shit. He dumps the one cooler he owned onto the ground and straight up LEFT ME THERE.  No car,  no light (he took them out of malicious intent) and my phone was dead on a non electric site. It was getting dark so I had to scurry and get the food I could fit into my cooler before the animals came out. Jar of pickles shattered.  Put the dry food (bread,  chips, etc) into my tent.  Dark came quickly.

I was surrounded until dawn by a dozen raccoons and they weren't playing.  Standing on their back legs,  hissing at me,  lunging for my feet.  I ended up back to a tree fighting those fuckers all night with a stick on fire. There are bears in those woods and that's my biggest phobia. I was terrified. Crying and panicking,  I heard a growl in the woods.  I just stood there frozen,  I was so damn scared ya'll. 

This son of a cunt tried to show up at 7am the next day telling me,  ""if you apologize for the mean way you treated me I'll take you home. ""  BITCH NOW THAT THE DAY BROKE YOU WANNA HELP?! I told that bastard to kick rocks and waited for my mom to come around noon.  I left the site with 2 days paid still on it. Wasnt going to fight those fucks again. And fuck that bear I heard. 

I have completely cut contact with him but he owes me money.  I do have a bunch of his expensive disc golf bullshit that he left here- which he's not getting until he pays me back. Petty or not,  I spent like 600 bucks on everything to do with this trip and he paid zero bc he lost his job. I was just trying to do something nice for him bc I badly wanted to go. Instead I get left in the dark with no communication device, no light, and have to fight off wild animals. No asshole, you can't come sweeping in and fix it. This will never be fixable. 

Sorry for the rant but I didn't know where else to post this.  fuck that dude.

Is it wrong for me to be upset when he uses all my stuff and won‚Äôt buy anything to replace it?,"I buy expensive shower gel. He used it all up. Claimed he accidentally spilt it in the shower. He told me he would replace it. This was 6 months ago. He does small loads of laundry rather than waiting for a large load and uses waaaay too much detergent, beads and dryer sheets. He eats all my snacks. He drinks all my bottled water and tea. Never buys any to replace them. 

I guess I was specifically set off today because he told me he would buy me 5 cases of water to replace all the water he‚Äôs been drinking. I know, it‚Äôs just water but I also drink a lot and having to buy new cases constantly adds up. So, we go to the store. I told him he doesn‚Äôt have to buy 5 and 2 will do. He insists on buying 5 so I‚Äôm like okay. I get my own stuff and at checkout I had to use the restroom so I gave him my card to get my stuff. What does he do? He charges it all on my card rather than just my portion. It was $15 worth of water. I‚Äôm so annoyed cause that is a lot of money to me. I only got the 5 cases cause he was supposed to pay for it. 

To add, I bought a thing of Oreos. It was Pok√©mon Oreos. When he got to checkout, I wasn‚Äôt there cause I was in the bathroom but apparently the cashier told him to watch out for a particular character on the Oreos cause that Oreo would sell for $8,000 online since it‚Äôs so rare. He was super excited about it and decided to go and buy the rest of the Pok√©mon Oreos on the shelf which was 6 more bags. For the small chance of getting that rare Oreo. But he couldn‚Äôt buy my water. He claimed he just forgot.  But he ALWAYS ‚Äúforgets‚Äù when it comes to buying stuff for my house that he uses a lot of. 

Now he‚Äôs talking about buying a $1,200 phone at full price. So I know it‚Äôs not cause he doesn‚Äôt have money for it. 

Am I wrong to be upset about all of this? It seems petty and small but it‚Äôs frustrating for me. I guess I could just use some advice.

Edit: I did confront him about the water in the car. He said ‚ÄúI forgot. Damn I can‚Äôt do anything right.‚Äù Then, I wrote this. We just got back to my house. He laid out all the fucking Oreo bags on the table and said ‚Äúwhich one should I open first?‚Äù I said ‚Äúwhy can you spend $24 on Oreos but you couldn‚Äôt buy my water?‚Äù He said he was sorry and turned the subject into something sexual. I, obviously annoyed, ignored him. He then put his headphones in and started jamming to music. I waited a few minutes and blew up on him. He told me he would buy all the stuff I‚Äôve been asking him to buy over the past few weeks when he gets paid cause it adds up to $100 and he ‚Äúhas never spent that much in a day.‚Äù He just bought a $100 hoodie last week. Lie. I confronted him with that. He said he would buy the grocery related stuff right now and would buy my shower gel and laundry stuff when he got paid. He just left to buy the grocery related stuff. I doubt he‚Äôs going to buy the other stuff without me having to ask him again. I appreciate everyone‚Äôs responses and I‚Äôm seriously rethinking our relationship.

Abortions banned after 6 weeks with extremely rare exceptions. We're looking at lawsuits and ( **EDIT: Have been made aware I was confusing this part with the Abolition Abortion bill, it is correct jail time is not on the table yet with SB8**) ladies, nothing about the men here, except they can sue us for this as well; I guess telling us what to do with our bodies isn't enough! Texas is even pushing for bills that go as far as to give a woman the death penalty for an illegal abortion, but this has not passed *yet*.


Seriously though, with the Republican majority in the Surpreme Court and this being passed in Texas, they soon will try even harder to put more restrictions on birth control and things like plan b. If you want to avoid the headache of being sued ~~and jailed~~ for an abortion, for any reason (the bill makes no exception for rape or incest!), take your pills, get your rings, shots, implants, IUD, tubes tied, whatever your choice is NOW before we can't. You can order plan b on Amazon much cheaper, and there's plenty of online doctors willing to get you birth control at an affordable price without insurance. If you want your tubes tied keep advocating for yourself until you find a doctor that will do it for you. 

And most importantly talk to your husbands/boyfriends about this. Discuss what they can do to help; It's unfair this bill puts the responsibility of the pregnancy 100% on the woman. Discuss your options if you were to get pregnant. Start tracking your periods and ovulation cycles. There is definitely apps for that. I'm serious. You'll thank me for it later. 


Screw you Greg Abbott.


*Edit: Thanks everyone for the interactions and awards. Please educate yourself on how you can prevent an unwanted pregnancy, as well as the many resources that are online to help get you what you need (birth control, implants, plan b, IUDs, ect). This bill goes into effect in September unless it is (hopefully) striked down. Your body is your right and we should always support each other as women. I appreciate the support from the men as well! Also, thank you to the trolling hate DM kind Redditor! I won't be engaging with that :)*

Vote these people out, be loud about it, and always advocate to your rights to your body. For those looking to leave Texas, I don't blame you lol. Thank you so much to everyone!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§*

**EDIT 3: I can't see any new comments from within the hour (it's almost 9pm here). I've also corrected my wording and I did have two different bills confused; however the matter still stands as is; abortions are outlawed past 6 weeks and we can be sued, doctors can lose their licenses and clinics. There are proposed bills to have penalties such as prison time and the death penalty, but these have not been passed yet. My biggest advice is to VOTE and always protect your sexual organs. I apologize for any confusion; either way this is still outrageous**

1660309881.0,Why are women pressured into receiving anal sex so much when men are the ones with orgasm buttons in their butts?,"This has always confused me.

I've met many cishet men who want to do anal with me. Like, its been disgusting how much pressure men have put towards violating a boundary I clearly state before getting into any sexual situation. I've had men beg me to play with my butt hole. I don't care if other people like anal, it's not for me and I shouldn't be pressured into doing something I'm not comfortable with. **I don't put pressure on men to do sexual things they state they aren't comfortable with and I expect the same respect in turn.**

What really grinds my gears is that if you ask most of these men if they'd let someone who has at least >50lbs on them go to town on their butt holes, they say no. They have no interest in having their anus violated. But why? **Men have an actual orgasm button in their butt holes so if anyone should be taking it up the ass in a cishet relationship, it makes far more sense for the man to be on the receiving end of anal.** (and yes I know there are plenty of cishet men who do butt stuff, I'm talking about the ones who only want to violate women's anuses and not have theirs even touched)

I hate the double standard of women needing to make their butt holes available for penetration, knowing full well we have far less of a chance from orgasming from anal stimulation than men, while men can keep their butt holes virginal. It's been relieving to dial back on dating and hooking up with men because I don't have to worry about someone pressuring me into doing something I don't want to do. I've had partners violate my boundaries and sexually assault me by trying to do anal, and that's an incredibly terrifying and gross experience I don't want to go through again.

Edit: to all the women who have been leaving comments here saying they have been anally raped and sexually assaulted by men, my heart goes out to you. Far too many us of have experienced this. It is so disgusting that there are some men out there who do this to women.

Edit 2: cishet = cisgendered heterosexual, it refers to a cis woman and cis man being together.

Edit 3: some people here have suggested that *some* men only have an interest in penetrating a woman's asshole to cause pain, degradation and humiliation.

1624185418.0,I stood up in court and testified against the person who raped and abused me for years.,"(Potential trigger warning)

The relationship with this person started off great. He was attentive and charming. He managed to convince me to move to a city hundreds of miles away (where he was from). He took my passport, he opened a joint bank account for us and cancelled my individual account. He took out a loan in both our names and spent all the money on his outstanding debts. 
He started to beat me almost every day. He started raping me when I said no to sex. He strangled me until I was unconscious and had sex with me while I was passed out.
He made me feel like it was all my fault and told me I deserved it. 
I began believing him. I blamed myself and began hating myself. I began living for the far and few between moments of tenderness and love he showed me. It felt like I was playing a game I didn‚Äôt know the rules of. 

I managed to make some very supportive friends and eventually I managed to leave this relationship with the help of my friends. He began to stalk and harass me so I went to the police about everything. This was in summer 2018.

The police investigated, handed it to the crown prosecution service and they decided to charge him with 5 counts of rape and one count of assault (resulting in ABH). It took almost 3 years but this week it went to trial. 

When they played my video recorded evidence from 3 years ago people in the jury cried. I gave evidence in the court room behind screens as to not having to see my abuser. 
I stood up and was cross examined by the Defense barrister who told me to my face I was lying and that my ex partner was a kind and loving person. My cross examination took almost 2 hours and was the most humiliating and painful thing I ever had to do. 
But I did it. I stood up in court and told my truth and ultimately stood up to him. 

On Friday I got the call. The jury found my ex unanimously guilty of all charges and he has been remanded into custody with a sentencing hearing scheduled the second week of July. He is probably looking at double figures in jail. 

It has taken 3 years, but it is finally over. I feel like I can finally breathe. And maybe, hopefully, I have saved at least one woman from going through the same hell I did. 
I still can‚Äôt believe it and keep breaking down crying.
Nothing will undo the pain and humiliation he put me through but I am proud of myself for surviving until now. I felt like dying so many times over the past few years. I planned my own death. But at the end of the day I chose to continue living. And now, I can learn to move on from simply surviving on to thriving.

I know my grandparents straight out told him to never see me again. During this period, I started urinating my bed at night and having mental breakdowns at school. I was so terrified of my father leaving me that I had my suicide planned in case the day he would realize I wasn‚Äôt worthy of his love because of my genetics would come. I wasn‚Äôt just scared, I was horrified. I remember being so anxious I had daily trouble with just breathing.

But my father didn‚Äôt do that. What he did instead was consoling me, again and again, on how much he loved me. He came to school after I locked myself in the bathroom with scissors to defend me. He did not once exclude me from the time he had with us (the kids). I was always afraid he would come to pick us up but leave with only my brothers, leaving me behind.  But that never happened, the contrary. He always had time for all of us and interest in our lives, despite working brutally long hours. He has been my biggest inspiration, my biggest motivator. He is always there when I need him. Just writing about my dad brings tears to my eyes. He is a man who learned how to do a french braid so I didn't have hair on my face when I was at my practice.

I just texted him, thanking him from being my dad. He replied: ‚ÄúI love you. being your dad is my privilege.‚Äù

ps. I just have to point out that I have read countless comments in Reddit that justify men cheating and having affairs. And not only justify them, but glorify it. In fact, there are entire subs dedicated to that.

As much as being hit on and catcalled is scary and I‚Äôm SO sorry to those it happens too, I get the opposite. All I ever see are posts on being catcalled and I just wanna talk about my experiences. I get moo‚Äôd at and barked at like a dog and vomit noises. We have a creepy old regular where I work that‚Äôs calls all the girls beautiful but is disgusted by me and has made negative comments on my appearance and literally told me to get out of his field of vision.

People act super awkward and their eyes dart all over the place trying to avoid making eye contact when I talk to them. Other times people are just straight up MEAN and dismissive of me, but treat everyone else with respect.

I‚Äôve been bullied and called ugly my whole life. Ever since I was 5 years old. Kids singled me out and were mean, and even the moms in my Girl Scout troop treated me differently. 

I remember in high school these two guys were sitting behind me and one just loudly asked the other if he would fuck me. The answer was a loud resounding ‚ÄúHELLLLL NAWWWW.‚Äù Of course if the answer had been the opposite, anyone would be creeped out and feel unsafe, but this moment still sticks with me and hurts for some reason.

Even with regular dentist appointments and good dental hygiene, I just have shit teeth that crack and break. My forehead is huge and I have a double chin that won‚Äôt go away and my eyebrows are wildly different from each other. My nose has been broken twice so you can only imagine what that looks like now.

I don‚Äôt take selfies. I hate pictures of myself and even still it hurts how friends and family don‚Äôt want to take any pictures with me. I do have a son and the whole reason I spiraled into typing this post was I have a photographer friend who offered to do valentines portraits of me and my son as a gift. I accepted FOR MY SON, not for me, and I‚Äôm not looking forward to it and it‚Äôs making me so sad. Every picture I see of myself I get super depressed. 

I have good hygiene. I bathe and smell good. I dress nice. I AM nice. But the few friends I have and even my mother have admitted I‚Äôm not exactly the most attractive woman so that just confirms everything else.

Hey y'all!
I'm a male, pretty skinny, with frizzy shoulder length hair. I've got a beard, but from the back I can easily be mistaken for a female. Today even more so, as I had just finished tubing down a river wearing a skintight long sleeved shirt and leggings to cover up from the sun (I wear shorts over my leggings to prevent unfortunate bulges). I was walking back to my car when a shiny SUV pulled up next to me and an elderly gentleman called out ""Need a ride, sweetheart?""
I turned to look at him and he visibly recoiled and drove off before I could say anything. In that moment I realized what a different experience it is for a guy and a girl to walk back from a beach.
I have no idea if he meant good or not. It's possible he legitimately legitimately wanted to help a girl walking along the side of a random road, dripping wet. But realizing that I was dripping wet, wearing skintight clothing, walking alone.... Yeah I doubt it.
I'm sorry. That experience terrified me, even as a guy with 7 years of martial arts experience. I didn't realize just how hard it must be to be a woman in a what so often is a man's world. If I ever hear guys making comments about how girls are sissy/overreacting, I'll tell them this story.

* https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/28/politics/abortion-bills-fail-nebraska-south-carolina/index.html

South Carolina's ban would have likely been overturned anyways as their State Supreme Court ruled that getting an abortion is part of the Right to Privacy guaranteed by the State Constitution when it struck down a 6-week ban a few months ago, and this would have been even more strict. But with the legislative session now over, abortion will remain legal through 22 weeks with further exceptions until at least 2024, and ensure that The South (where almost all of the 13 U.S. states that ban abortions are) will have at least one safe haven for the time being.

Nebraska meanwhile saw a 6-week abortion ban fail by ONE vote after 2 GOP members abstained from voting. The Governor is now putting pressure on them to make their position clear, and the bill could yet still pass, but for now it remains blocked and abortion remains legal in the state through 20 weeks and with further exceptions after.",TwoXChromosomes

As the guys came up and started getting pieces of cake I told them (very loudly) how lucky they were that I came into work that night.  It would have really sucked if there had been no vagina on the property to cut the cake and they would have just had to stare at it all night.

One day they came in and grabbed me from behind. dragged me outside and put me in the trash can in front of the whole school.

Because of my mom‚Äôs health issues, my poor father had to take me. He tried. He really did. But he handed me off to a kind lady to fit me (34A) and then bought me several bras.  No questions asked-I bought several sports bras, a couple cute ones and a padded one. 

My dad is Catholic. He would walk through a fire for me, but bra shopping was hard for him.  He deserves all the love. He would buy me feminine products and ice cream when I needed it. All he asked was that I don‚Äôt tell him too many details‚Äîunless I needed to, and then he would listen. 10/10, best dad. 

Fast forward to adulthood. I‚Äôve got a Victoria Secret credit card, and a coupon book. I buy myself a nice bra every month for a year (the coupon book makes the bras cost the same -or less- than Walmart!). 

One day a nice lady asks me if I need help, I hold up a bra and ask it if she has it in 34A. She asks if I‚Äôm shopping for myself...?  I tell her yes. 

She asks if she can give me a bra fitting...?  She has the customer service smile in place.

 I think, I get it‚Äîshe has to do so many fitting a day!  She wants to measure me to meet a quota. Sure!!  I love helping people out. I‚Äôm the kinda person, I‚Äôll definitely do that survey you offer me because your boss needs so many a day. I‚Äôm not in a hurry, knock yourself out!  

So she measures me.

I‚Äôve been muffin-topping out of an A cup since I was a teenager. I was 13 when I was first fitted.  It never occurred to me that my size changed. I thought it was constant, like my eye color or hair color. 

My sisters were both A cups, they were prettier than me, it never occurred to me I wasn‚Äôt the same size (or larger?) than them. 

So she brought me the right size. 

They didn‚Äôt hurt. It didn‚Äôt hurt to breathe!

They didn‚Äôt have a weird, bumpy outline under my shirt.

I bought three. I donated my old ones (which were practically brand new) to a women‚Äôs shelter. 

I‚Äôve bought a bra about every other month or so. 

Thank you Victoria Secret lady. You gambled that I wasn‚Äôt a bitch who would be mad you put me in a size larger than I thought.

If you‚Äôd shamed me, I wouldn‚Äôt have recovered. Instead, you made me feel good about my size. You told me it was normal to miss a cup change. You made me feel good about my body.

I was ready when I posted this for shitty messages but I wasn‚Äôt ready for the kindness and it made me cry a bit. To everyone else who has had similar experiences, I hate you assaulters too. It‚Äôs shitty that we even have to say what happened to us to get people to listen and rethink their stances. To all the guys who are supportive; thank you. Keep it up, and bring it up if you can with your mates to help them also feel like they have a friend that shares a stance on reproductive rights so they are more likely to be open about it. 
To all the journalists who wrote me, I will be contacting you in a week. 
Thanks for the awards. I know you shouldn‚Äôt spend money in apps, but it does help this post get visibility and I hope that helps other people get the courage they need too after this week to stop arguing, stop listening, stop pretending it‚Äôs a different opinion.

He wanted a way to know if I'd done a chore (laundry, grocery shopping, cooking a meal) when he wasn't around.

1622339661.0,I'm sick of women perpetuating misogyny in childfree spaces,"I'm childfree. I love kids and I spoil my niece but my wife is disabled and I choose to put her care first. We don't have the time or emotional bandwidth available to care for a third person. So it's the two of us. 

Recently, I started looking into childfree spaces on Reddit to see if there was a supportive community for someone like me. 

Oh. My. God. The subreddit is supposedly 75% women but they're out here calling other women ""breeders"" and ""broodmares."" They mock pregnant and postpartum bodies and spread misinformation about birth and pregnancy. Some women tear when they have kids, but they don't all get a ""vagasshole"" from giving birth. They don't all lose all their hair and teeth and age ten years. Not every man is an unwilling father who got ""baby trapped"" into having kids.

They slut-shame single moms and assume a woman should have seen a divorce coming ten years early. 

And when you call them out on their shit, they say it's not valid to call them misogynists even though all they do is hate on women who chose to do something different than they did. 

Women CAN be misogynists, but we shouldn't be.

Edit: To the people who say that I ""don't get"" the sub or lack nuance: I'm in a lesbian relationship, and my mom still asks me all the time if we're going to adopt or get a sperm donor someday. I get societal pressure on women to procreate. Maybe doubly so because I'm LGBTQ and also ducked the system that way. You can hate the system oppressing you without hating women who make different choices than you.

Edit 2: to the people who recommended truechildfree, I'm looking into other spaces where I would be a better fit, but I wanted to make this post to point out what I saw in the regular childfree sub. 

To the people who said I'm not really childfree myself, baby you don't know me. I don't want kids. Cool Aunty for life!

To the person who DMed me to thank me for ""removing my crazy from the gene pool"": you're welcome, baby. I hope you do the same.

Edit 3: to the person from the childfree sub harassing me in my DMs: 
1) you've been reported

I was walking back from the dog park with my happy puppy and an older man on a bike yelled across the street that he was cute, I laughed and said thank you. Par for the course with my dog - I'm sure you can see why. The man then took this as an invitation to bicycle over to me, and stop right next to me.  

He began to ask me questions and the encounter went from pleasant to irritating. ""How old are you, are you in school? What's your puppy's name?""  

I told him my boyfriend was in med school and waiting for me (he is actually out of the country, so not true), and to have a nice day, and he proceeded to go ""mannnnnnn...everyone has a boyfriend..."" and bicycle next to me down the path back to my apartment, as I was clearly walking away from him and he had been going the other way.  

My pup then turns to him and starts snarling, and barking, an absolute first for him. His hackles are raised, and he starts jumping towards the man on his bike a bit. The creep gets all nervous, saying stuff like ""woah, woah woah, why are you acting like this puppy?"" and finally stops cycling and lets me walk back alone. Of course, he still yelled out ""WANNA FUCK?"" across the parking lot.

Because. Of. Fake. Internet. Points. And. Because. I. am. A. Women.

While there is alot of positive comments the bad ones really are just gut punching.

SHE DOESNT DESERVE THE UPVOTES ! STUPID SIMPS bla bla bla bla "". Like cmon. What the heck is wrong with some people. They act like women gaming is a rare thing. ITS NOT.

Q: WhY DiDnT YoU JuSt BlOcK HiM yOu SnOwFlAkE? #triggered  
A: If my house had been robbed, you wouldn't tell me to ""just change my locks and move on"". This isn't the first dick pic I have received in my life, however this is the first time I've had the courage to do something about it, not only for me but for all women. What he did is illegal. Maybe not in your country (even though it should be, wtf), but it is in mine. I didn't want to see his dick, I didn't want to hear about how he'd love to come on my feet, why should it be MY JOB to see his dick, block him, and move on, when he could, you know, respect women and NOT SEND PICTURES OF HIS DICK IN THE FIRST PLACE? God. Are you all so desensitized to shit you see online that a clear violation of your boundaries is NBD? Also what's to say he's not gonna send a picture of his dick to another woman once I've blocked him? I am done putting up with this kind of shit. It's 2019. **Respect women or face the consequences of your actions.**

Q: Backstory please?   
A: Alright it's gonna be short and sweet. Last may, this prince charming added me on facebook, I messaged him to ask if we knew each other because at the time I was working on my girlfriend's documentary and meeting a lot of new people whose name I did not always remember. He told me that unfortunately, we did not, but he would love to get to know me. I told him that I wasn't interested. He sent a few pictures of himself, told me ""see, now you see who I am ;)"", tried flirting with me to convince me, I shut that shit down, told him that I am a lesbian, in a relationship, and not interested in making friends with him. Fast forward to tonight where I have the utter pleasure to get two dick pics completely out of the blue, soon followed by a video because ""he's single, horny and I'm pretty"", because as we say in french, monsieur is a poet.  I told him to stop several times, and this Shakespeare reborn then wrote ""I'm gonna cum"" and ""Hopefully on your pretty little feet"". That's it. That's the backstory. I didn't block him in case the cops didn't want me to. 

Q: What's gonna happen now?   
A: The police will probably contact me in the upcoming weeks to hand over my facebook info and this happened over Messenger. A man was recently convicted of sexual harassment over a dick pic for the first time in France, so they're starting to have a process in place, if that makes sense. 

Q: You are a bitch/sad/pathetic/a typical triggered female.   
A: Thanks! :)

1653299040.0,I was lost in the big city at night without my phone. Ran into a group of men. Turned out better than I hoped.,"So this Saturday i was a long way from home at a festival-like event with my bff and some girls from her university class. It was fun and we danced and got a little too many beers.

Unfortunately on my way home, I got separated from them. Oh well, this happens - let me just call‚Ä¶ oh no. My phone is dead. And suddenly I was all alone in a city i didn‚Äôt live in with no way to contact anyone at the middle if the night. 

I was SO scared. I began crying and aimlessly walking toward the next bus stop. I had no idea how to get home - only knew if I could get to the main station, then there was a chance. But i didn‚Äôt know where i was or how to get there. I got on the first bus and asked if it took me there. It did not - but somewhat close to there. And i just couldn‚Äôt stop crying. 

Out of no where - this guy swooped in and asked me if i was ok. He heard me crying and was so concerned about me. And me being scared and drunk i told him my issue and what city I lived in. He gathered his guys (they were a couple of friends who went out together) and went to tell me not to worry and promised they would get me home safe. 

They tried to cheer me up and asked me about life and school. Introduced themselves and asked if I had anyone I would like to call. Offered me their phones. I called my mom and bf - and neither picked up - so they wrote them a text explaining the situation. And that they were helping me get home and not to worry. 


We all finally got on the train together headed for the city i live in (two of them were headed the same way) and helped me check in and even offered to pay for my way home if necessary.

We finally got to my city and they smiled - asked if could find my way back home (i could) - and then said goodbye and left. They wanted nothing from me but knowing i was safe. 

I have been so moved by this experience. A group of guys in their thirties taking their time to help a dumb little 21 year old me get home safe. Wanting nothing in return.

In a world so cruel and harsh as ours its been so incredible to know kind people still exist. I don not believe I will ever forget them. I just wish i could show them how grateful i am for their help.

So thats it. I just wanted to share some positive with you all.",TwoXChromosomes
1549071519.0,"8 years ago, an ex-boss told me (in front of my coworkers) that I would always be a low-level worker bee. Today, I was promoted to director level and manage a team of 15!","I've had my share of crappy jobs. When I graduated from a 2-year degree program at the height of the recession, I drove 2 hours each way to an unpaid internship thinking it'd lead somewhere (it didn't, also...please don't do this, it's not worth it lol)

Meanwhile, I was working double shifts at a grocery store (frying donuts from 3-7 am and then working 8 AM to sometimes 9 PM, depending on the shift). My next job had me working 6-6 Monday through Friday and 6-2 on Saturdays during the busy season (mandatory overtime).

Then I got what I thought was a real, professional job in a bigger city. My boss was...something else. He yelled at me on my first day because I accidentally sent someone to his voicemail that I shouldn't have (I didn't know any better). Every day got worse after that.

After weeks of waking up with panic attacks every morning at 3 or 4 AM, I approached him and broke down because I thought I had accepted a position related to my field but the job actually required large-scale proposal writing (which I had no experience in and which the position offered no training). He promised to take those from me and had me focus on what I was skilled at. Later, in a meeting with the entire team, he announced that I would always be a low-level worker bee. The next week, to a smaller group (with me present), he said ""Let's be real, BushyEyes isn't doing well here."" After several months in the position, I was fired. In that moment, I was convinced that I would never amount to anything. (Shout-out to the barista at the cafe down the street for the complimentary latte and cookie to a crying, newly unemployed girl)

I don't want to say that he inspired me to be better because I don't want to give him any credit for my hard work. Today, though, I think back and remember those words as my promotion to director level became official. I manage a team of 15 people and I support and nurture their development and I take a service-oriented approach to leadership instead of bringing them down to make myself look big.

1577175917.0,The story about labiaplasty you haven‚Äôt heard,"She was just 17 when he agreed to perform a labiaplasty on her. Like many naive young women, she thought her labia minora were not supposed to stick out.

She had read online, on surgeons‚Äô websites and in peer-reviewed medical literature, that protruding labia minora were considered ‚Äúunfeminine‚Äù and ‚Äúembarrassing.‚Äù She read they were caused by excess male hormones (untrue) and excess masturbation (preposterous).

He had been recommended by the head of the OB/GYN department as the best OB/GYN surgeon at Baylor Hospital in Dallas. She was confident she was in good hands. They waited until after she turned 18 to do the procedure.

He completely removed her labia minora, performed a clitoral hood reduction without her consent, and cut the dorsal nerves of her clitoris. The glans of her clitoris would never be sexually sensitive again. Cunnilingus would never again be pleasurable.

He had only done a labiaplasty twice before. Like most OB/GYNs who do these procedures, he had not been trained to do them. He never disclosed that anything had gone wrong, but he stopped doing these surgeries after that.

She knew she had lost sensation but didn‚Äôt understand what that meant. She assumed everything would work out when she started having sex. She thought it was her fault. She didn‚Äôt know enough about her anatomy to understand he had done a separate surgery without her consent. She started seeing a new doctor because she was so uncomfortable. The new doctor was his partner. Upon seeing an 18 year old with completely amputated labia minora, she said nothing.

Later, the young woman worked up the courage to ask her doctor if her surgery had caused her difficulty with orgasm. She could not feel anything without a vibrator, she said. Despite the visible scars reaching well into her clitoral hood, her female doctor told her her surgery could not have affected her sexual function.

The original male doctor meanwhile became president of the Texas Medical Association.

The young woman finally found her clitoris. The glans was not sensitive like it was supposed to be. She went to a new female doctor. The new doctor also told her her surgery could not have affected her sexual function. She suggested she fall in love. Though the new doctor was ‚Äúhorrified‚Äù that all her labia minora had been amputated, she did not tell her she could report it.

The young woman started doing research. Eventually she figured out a clitoral hood reduction had been performed without her consent. Given the course of the dorsal nerves along the clitoral body, she figured out they must have been injured.

The young woman did a lot of research. She realized the course of the dorsal nerves was never mentioned in literature on clitoral hood reductions. It was never shown in OB/GYN journals. It was never shown in OB/GYN textbooks. She also learned that the sexual function of the labia minora was rarely described. She thought her doctor must not have realized they were important. How else could he have completely amputated them? She thought he must not have realized the dorsal nerves were at risk. She decided this error must have occurred because her doctor didn‚Äôt know the anatomy.

She wrote him a letter telling him what he had done and asking him to help her change training standards to protect other patients.

He responded reminding her that the surgery was her choice. He reminded her that she had requested her labia minora not stick out. He had only tried to give her what she asked for.

He told her he stayed far away from her clitoral hood and frenulum. But there were scars to prove otherwise.

The young woman became emotionally unstable after reading this letter. She wanted to report him but was told the board would likely blame her and take his side. She had never had what happened to her confirmed by a doctor, so she went to see one. It was confirmed. This was what she had needed to give legitimacy to her complaint, she thought.

But it became unbearable. No one around her seemed to understand the magnitude of what had happened. People asked her what the big deal was. People asked her why she needed justice. When she tried to talk to therapists, they asked about her feelings about her mother. It had taken 7 years to finally get it confirmed. She had hoped it was fixable somehow. It wasn‚Äôt fixable.

She felt ashamed. How could she have been so stupid to not file a lawsuit when there was still time? She read research on resilience. Based on all the parameters surrounding her trauma, she did not think she could ever be okay. It was like getting horribly raped in a world where rape isn‚Äôt considered a crime. She read she needed acknowledgment, support, etc. Most of all, she needed to change the problem of pervasive systemic negligence. But no one was even seeing it. She didn‚Äôt like the wreck of a person she was becoming.

One night she set Joy Division ‚ÄúAtmosphere‚Äù on repeat, took 60 Vicodin, some Xanax, some Benadryl hoping that would help stop her heart, and as much whiskey as she could drink. Her dad checked on her in the middle of the night. He took her to the hospital.

She was afraid to report after that. She was afraid of getting told it was her fault. She was afraid of people defending her doctor. One OB/GYN she had gone to had said:

‚ÄúYou should have known all surgery carried risk. You can never completely control a result.‚Äù

It had been wrong site surgery. That should never happen. But she was afraid of this. She was afraid even doctors wouldn‚Äôt understand the difference between the labia minora and the clitoral hood.

She told herself she would report him when she got more stable. Back then there was no statute of limitations. She thought she had time.

When she finally got the courage to report, they had passed a new statute of limitations. She missed it by a week.

So she started coming up with new ideas for how to stand up for herself. She wrote a letter to the head of patient safety at the hospital. He agreed to meet with her. But she was too afraid. She thought if she wrote down everything she needed to say, complete with references, this would help. She started writing.

But she hated writing. She‚Äôd never been any good at it.

She wrote what she called, ‚ÄúA Clinical History, Causal Analysis, and Proposed Solutions.‚Äù She wrote a background of the anatomy and prevalence of labiaplasty. She wrote a clinical history of herself. Then she broke down all the causal factors accordingly:
1. Motivation
2. Cause of surgical error
3. Failure to disclose or report

Then she wrote a proposal. Solving problems at every error point was important. She got a bit overwhelmed. There were so many problems.

She got very stuck. She kept getting dizzy. She‚Äôd get angry at herself for getting dizzy. She was being weak, she thought.

People asked when she was ever going to do anything worthwhile. They told her she was lazy. She didn‚Äôt deserve to live in such a nice apartment, they said. She didn‚Äôt deserve to wear such nice clothes, they said. She didn‚Äôt deserve vacations. She should be ashamed of herself for not having a career like everyone else. They told her she wasn‚Äôt dealing with this well. When was she ever going to learn to deal with anything? She mostly kept to herself. When she tried to date, issues would come up. Men told her they couldn‚Äôt date her because she was emotionally unstable. One said he‚Äôd rather date a barista with a plan.

The worst part isn‚Äôt what happened. The worst part is how much I came to hate myself for not handling it better. I‚Äôm working on that. 

My doctor isn‚Äôt some random ‚Äúbad apple.‚Äù He is an extremely reputable OB/GYN. He has been president of the Texas Medical Association and president of the Dallas County Medical Society. 
Other doctors still talk about his ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù and ‚Äúselflessness,‚Äù as they give him awards. He was also featured in Time Magazine for delivering the first uterus transplant baby. 

But honestly, the worst part isn‚Äôt what happened to me. The worst part has been everything that has happened since in my struggle to get acknowledgment and to address the systemic negligence that continues to put others at risk.

If I could get my doctor to acknowledge what he did, he has the political power to help change training standards to keep other patients safe. Instead, he refuses to acknowledge it. Though his colleague has explained to him that I have visible scars proving what he did, he insists he didn‚Äôt do it. He says I must have had a second surgery or that I operated on myself.

Perhaps the worst part is how medical leadership has stood by him and refused to even talk to me about changing curriculums and board exams because of who my doctor was. This happened due to systemic negligence that will not change as long as people refuse to admit there is any problem. Doctors continue to do vulvar cosmetic surgeries (and treatment of hypertrophy) without training.

Even with my dad as the head of the plastic surgery department at the same hospital where my doctor works, we cannot get through to him. The OB/GYN department refuses to speak to either me or my dad. After I asked them to teach clitoral neurovascular anatomy, they called legal to make sure they can‚Äôt get sued for not teaching it.

Update: We are publishing a cadaver dissection study of the neural anatomy of 10 clitorises, of which we took excellent photos. There is a new head of the OB/GYN department who wants the residents to learn it. I also got a form letter from ABOG, in which they claim to be working on new board exam questions.

Second update: I have gotten authors of two major OB/GYN textbooks (Te Linde, Williams) to publish detailed clitoral anatomy. I also convinced an OB/GYN to oversee a study published in AJOG. And finally, my study was published in The Aesthetic Surgery Journal. 

However, I have not been successful at changing privileging. To this day, someone as equally as unqualified my doctor can still get privileges to do labiaplasties at the surgery center where mine occurred and at many others. USPI, the biggest ambulatory care provider in the US, declined to require training in these procedures. Another problem is many of these are performed in private offices, where there is generally no oversight. 

Labiaplasty is still the fastest growing cosmetic procedure, as it has been for almost 2 decades.

If you or a friend has a similar story, please contact me. One expert I talk to believes there are thousands like me. Based on the other stories I have gotten, it is typical for women to get gaslighted in these situations and told their issues are psychological. This happens due to pervasive ignorance of vulvar anatomy and female sexual function in medicine. 

I need more women who are willing to be interviewed by a journalist. üôèüèª

Edit: thanks everyone so much for all the upvotes and supportive comments! I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allowed to share this, but my Instagram is @jessica_ann_pin. I talk about this and related issues there. This is my latest post showing how cross sections of the penis are always shown in anatomy textbooks but cross sections of the clitoris are shown in 0 anatomy textbooks: 

https://www.instagram.com/p/B6bnuKSp4Rt/?igshid=kp2hm8adb2oy

Third update: I have gotten 18 medical textbooks to agree to updates. 4 have now been published. I‚Äôve also gotten Medscape, UpToDate, and WebMD to agree to updates.

ABOG now requires urogynecologists to learn clitoral innervation as part of their maintenance of certification. They have made it incentivized learning for gynecologists. They still refuse to make it required learning for gynecologists. 

ACOG still refuses to dictate the innervation of the clitoris be taught in all OB/GYN residency programs. Here is my petition to change this. It has 27,000 signatures so far.

An unnamed person was sentenced to death by the Iranian courts for participating in the current anti-morality police protests/civil unrest for women's rights.

Human rights organizations are warning of hasty executions that was previously seen in the Bloody November uprising where over 1,500 men, women AND CHILDREN were executed, while Iranian officials only recognize ~350 initially. The numbers were murky for a while because the Iranian government cut off the internet for the entire country and many of the detained protesters were journalists.

There are currently over 15,000 persons detained in government custody for an undisclosed amount of time.

The EU is enacting new sanctions in response to the Iranian government's treatment of protesters and French President Macron recognized this uprising as a revolution, a continuation of the 70's civil unrest. 

We need to amplify what's happening in Iran because it's getting drowned out of the spot light.

1653500457.0,"For those of your considering leaving the US, just do it.","I grew up in the US and moved to Norway at 21. It opened my eyes to how balanced life could be, and what a society is like when equality is taken seriously. 

One of the first things that struck me was  no ogling.. I could walk around without unwanted stares or comments that used to happen to me daily in America. Men are much more professional at work, I am no longer constantly questioning their motives.

University here is free, and there are a better mix of women in STEM fields compared to many other countries. For example, there are more female physicians in Norway than male physicians. 

Work life balance is deeply valued. We have a 37.5 hour work week, and flexible working is the norm. If you are having a baby you and your partner can choose between 49 weeks of maternity leave (+ 3 weeks before birth) at 100% pay or 59 weeks (+ 3 weeks before birth) at 80% pay. Fathers have to take a minimum of 15 weeks of paternity leave. The same benefits apply for adoption and same sex couples. You get extra paid time for multiples as well. Everyone gets 5 weeks paid vacation, basically unlimited paid sick leave and child care days for when your kids are sick. 

Healthcare is basically free. You pay a small copay (around $30) for a doctors visit. If you use more than around $300 on prescriptions and visits then you get something called blue prescription that means you don‚Äôt have to pay for anything anymore. Baby related care, checkups and prenatal care is 100% free. If I‚Äôm not mistaken Norway also has the lowest maternal death rates in the world. Kids healthcare is completely free. 

When I gave birth to my son I did not see a single man at the hospital besides my partner. It was the most amazing and supportive birthing environment. When I had a missed miscarriage and needed medicine to help my body start clearing it out, I was again surrounded by supportive all female medical staff, no judgement, no rules stopping me from receiving lifesaving care. 

The vast majority of men here are raised to contribute equally, from childcare to cleaning and cooking. It is expected to split these duties equally. Toxic masculinity isn‚Äôt really a thing here. 

Norway has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world. There has been one school shooting here (no casualties) and one bad terrorist attack (22nd July). There have been 2000+ school shootings in the US since 1970. 

Is it perfect here? No. But in my opinion it‚Äôs a thousand times better than the US (and like 30 years ahead rights wise). 

My grandparents were holocaust survivors who went to the US for a better life. I love the US and it breaks my heart to see it deteriorating. I always planned to move back but now I don‚Äôt feel like there is anything to go back to. I could never give up the freedom I have here.

If you have the chance to get out, do it! There are so many better places to live. Places where women are seen as equals  not incubators. Places where children‚Äôs live are worth more than someone‚Äôs hobby.

EDIT: a lot of people mentioned that I must have been rich to be able to move to Europe or come from a wealthy family. Lol ya‚Äôll I wish but no. Grandparents came here as refugees with no money and worked factory jobs after coming to US. My mom worked sorting packages and my dad was a house painter. We were 3 kids and broke. I worked 30-40 hours a week the whole time I was in college, had student loans etc. 

If someone is sponsoring you in Norway (for example if you get married), the minimum income they need to have is around 30,000 dollars a year to bring you over. You can work at McDonald‚Äôs and make more than that here. 

It‚Äôs not just higher education that you can get a work visa for in Norway, you can also get a visa for being a waiter or working in tourism related industries, and a lot of other seasonal work as well so it is really a lower threshold here than other countries. The immigration system here is considerably simpler than other countries, and very modern. 

I mentioned in the comments that I was extremely lucky to get the opportunity to move and know that not everyone will have the same opportunity. I didn‚Äôt formulate what I was trying to say very well in my original post but I almost didn‚Äôt move when I had the chance, and my life would have been completely different if I hadn‚Äôt. I just wanted to encourage those people who might have the chance or could get there to try. I‚Äôm not saying the process is as easy as ‚Äújust do it‚Äù. It takes time, work and money. I needed around $1200 for visa and flights to get to Norway.

My beloved Fiat started doing a thing 5 weeks ago where it won‚Äôt let me pump gas - the pump clicks off after 1 to 3 seconds of filling. I can put gas in it, but I have to stand there clicking the pump for 15 minutes to fill it up.  
I have had multiple men come up to me in gas stations and say, ‚Äúhoney, that means it‚Äôs full,‚Äù which makes me want to light them on fire.  
I took my Fiat in to my mechanic on Monday and they looked at it (they were great but unable to determine the problem)  and told me to take it to the Fiat dealer. Yesterday I took it to the dealer and got a call at the end of the day that the car was going to be ready that night for pick up. After I thanked them profusely I asked what was wrong with the gas tank. The manager tells me nothing is wrong with it and after I insisted there was a problem, he said I would need to come in the morning and one of his guys would go pump gas with me.  
This morning I show up and one of the technicians drives me to the gas station and gives me a lecture on how to pump gas. I told him I‚Äôve had this car for 6 years and haven‚Äôt had a brain aneurysm so I don't think it‚Äôs user error. He pumps the gas and of course it does the same thing to him and he is legitimately surprised.

1563817196.0,My boyfriend had a grownup's reaction to getting an erection,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this so I apologize if it isn't.

For context, when I was in high school I was with a dude who made me feel like the worst woman alive for leaving him with an erection. I had (have) a lot of hangups when it comes to sex and so I wanted to take things slow. This dude came at me with every excuse he could think of if he got an erection, ""It huUurts!""

""You're making me feel bad about getting it!""

""You dont know how bad this feels if you don't do anything with it!"" And being 17 and stupid,  I let him convince me of doing more than I was remotely comfortable with just for his comfort. As an adult, I hate the fact it happened that way and I wish I had kicked him but that's in the past.

Last night, my boyfriend and I were hanging out in his apartment finishing up a movie. He had told me going in that he was a physically affectionate guy but that he would go at my pace. I couldn't even hug the man right on our first date but as I got more comfortable around him I got more comfortable with his physical affection. We start kissing and generally just having a good time before I had to leave to go home. He rolls me into a certain position and I can feel it against my stomach. And in the back of my mind, I'm waiting for it. Some excuse or push against my boundaries to see what I would do. I moved a certain way to make sure I didn't hurt him and he asked me what was going on. I motion my head towards his erection and instead of an excuse, all he says is, ""Oh don't worry about it. It'll go away in a couple of minutes.""

No excuses.

No whining.

We keep making out for a while until I have to go home and I am on freaking cloud 9.

So, moral of the story, let your boundaries be where they are! You will find someone who respects them and your boundaries will change with that person as you get comfortable.

I would never have asked that of my parents. We just didn't have that type of relationship. It's so important to talk to your kids about this stuff! I always answered all their questions about sex honestly. While looking them straight in the eye. Yes, it's embarrassing Yes, my face was probably bright red during our conversations. I explained to both my daughter and my son all the different types of birthcontrol and made sure they understood their options. Which is how my son knew about PlanB. I am just really, really so proud of him. I know people have different beliefs and some might not agree with this but it's just so important to have an honest open (age appropriate of course) dialogue with your kids starting when they are young. It makes it so much easier to have the conversations when they are older.

Because the child has special needs, she has been unable to say what happened to her, making the case against him a ""she said, he said"" case. So it was a very shaky case against him. A couple days ago, my ex-husband sent me a text that stated he didn't know what he was doing when he was touching the girl and would have kept going if the girlfriend wouldn't have stopped him. I have kept this text to myself for a couple days, scared of retaliation from him and his family if I turned it into the police. Today, I turned it in. The cycle needs to stop. I need to put children's lives in front of my own fear. The weight has lifted off my shoulders. Somehow, I feel guilty that I am sending my sons father to jail, but is a sick man that needs put away. My son is too young to understand that right now. I went through hell to get full custody of him, and my ex is court ordered no contact with him. That man should not be around any children. I am now looking fear in the face and it is daunting, but I can do this. For all the children that would be and have been hurt by this monster.

1580474631.0,The Uber driver who drove me home from work yesterday was waiting outside of my work today,"Edit: 30... Thirty... I'm 30. I should have just used the numbers in the first place, reading comprehension is hard I know... I am an adult, not thirteen. Also while I'm here, huge shoutout to the guy who called me ""a drama queen with a blind eye"", I kind of loved it, thank you.

As a contextual thing, I take a lot of Ubers because I am functionally blind in one eye and the lack of depth perception causes me to be unable to drive.

This guy was my Uber driver home from work yesterday morning (I work nights). He told me that I looked to be about the same age as him and I laughed as he looked to be in his mid-forties and I am having my thirtieth birthday in a couple of weeks, but he seemed surprised when I told him my age and made a joke about ""there goes my five stars"". That was slightly awkward but no big deal, I gave him the same five stars I give to every Uber driver who doesn't act like an enormous asshole. But then he drove me home again this morning.

At first I thought that he was just in his usual area or what have you, but this man felt perfectly comfortable with telling me that he had pulled into the parking lot and had waited for ten minutes for me to come out and order an Uber. What the unholy fuck?! So I'm already uncomfortable. 

He asked me what I do on the weekends and I told him that that's when I spend my time with my friends. He then asked me whether I wanted one more friend, a question that I tried to dodge the pointed intention of by saying something like ""haha, it's always good to have friends"". But he told me that he ""was interested in getting to know me"" anyway and that's why he was waiting outside my work today. Said he likes how my laugh sounds.

Then he started regaling me with sad tales of his personal life, including his mother's cancer. This was actually a slight improvement because it wasn't about me at all. 

THEN, when he dropped me off he pointedly asked ""so how do I get in touch with you outside of (place I work in)?"". I was stunned into silence and he followed up with a standard sad-toned ""I don't?"". I basically told him that I didn't feel comfortable with that as I don't know him at all, got out of the car and didn't look back.

This is crazy. How does this complete stranger think that ANY ONE ELEMENT of this is even remotely appropriate? Just because a woman is friendly and smiles at you is no excuse to literally STALK HER outside of her job and push your company on her. I feel disgusted by the very idea that this guy may well be in that parking lot again on Monday morning and I will not be entering his vehicle ever again. If you ever need more evidence to not give these people your full address, you never know when someone may just decide to wait where they know you'll be.",TwoXChromosomes

We always had sex with the lights off in the dark or under the blankets. I come from a childhood with longterm sexual abuse, emotional and physical abuse.  This caused me to be very ashamed and embarrassed about my body. In my teen years, this resulted in self harm and now my legs are covered in scars.

I was always so afraid to show my body. Nobody has ever seen me naked in my adult life before this day. But this night it happened. We had sex with the lights on. Naked. My boyfriend was over the moon.

I don't really have friends to talk about this and I really felt like I wanted to tell this. I feel so relieved. But also ashamed that it took me 3 years to feel comfortable. I am also afraid he now doesn't have any suprises left - he has seen it all why would he stay? There is no more to imagine. What if he gets bored of it?

1595802111.0,When Adult Men Physically Threaten Young Women,"My boyfriend and I both currently work in (different) restaurants. I work as a server, and he works as a bar manager.

Yesterday, he came home from work and was fairly distant and quiet. I could tell his mind was elsewhere. So, I prodded a little bit over the course of a few hours, as I was concerned for him.

Well, when he opened up...I was shocked.

Yesterday, a family of 5 walked into his restaurant, and the father wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask. Currently, his restaurant requires that everyone wears a mask while entering the building, walking around the building, working, or leaving the building. And they hold to it.

So, a young teenage hostess asked the father if he had a mask...they have masks to provide to guests should they not have one.

The mother answered ‚ÄúOh! He doesn‚Äôt wear a mask.‚Äù And chuckled.

The father...then lifted his shirt, revealing a gun on his hip, and stated ‚ÄúWhen you have one of these, you don‚Äôt need a mask!‚Äù

The hostess made a quick and smart decision...she de-escalated the situation and sat the family at a table closest to the door.

She then immediately informed my boyfriend and the front of house manager of what happened. 

Both managers assessed the situation, and decided to call the police. When the police showed up, they escorted the father to the parking lot. A few minutes later, the father re-entered the building, spoke with his family quietly, and they left the restaurant.

Can you imagine being a teenager making minimum wage, being threatened by a grown man with a gun...over a mask being required on private property??

He literally threatened a teenager with a gun in order to gain access to private property...all because he didn‚Äôt want to comply with restaurant‚Äôs mask requirements, which are in line with current CDC recommendations and government mandates...

The hostess must be terrified to go back to work!

I‚Äôm terrified to go back to work at my restaurant!

My boyfriend worries if the father will retaliate, and if others will act as the father did...

I‚Äôve had a consistent fever along with that crappy overall sick feeling. I got tested for COVID and it returned negative and I saw my PCP who thought it was just the flu. I thought she was probably right, so I thought nothing of it. Then, today, I get this horrible fucking pain in my lower abdomen and I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm having a heart attack because my chest was tight and I felt like I was going to pass out.

Then, when they took my blood pressure it was 196/132 and my heart rate was 173. They took it THREE FUCKING TIMES while I lay there thinking I was going to die. Only then, when they saw it wasn‚Äôt a fluke, did they hurry and get me to the hospital. Turns out I have sepsis and am spending the holidays in the hospital. 

I just don‚Äôt understand why these paramedics, all men, went straight to ‚Äúshe‚Äôs having an anxiety attack like all women‚Äù instead of taking this seriously.

Edit: Wow! I did not expect this to gain so much traction! Thank you to everyone who contributed to this post. For some more background, I think part of the reason it really settled badly with me is because I‚Äôm immunocompromised (which I told them), and have multiple autoimmune diseases (which I told them) including fibrosis of the liver (which again I told them). Knowing all of this, they failed to take my condition seriously. I don‚Äôt expect them to diagnosis me because I‚Äôd have never thought it was sepsis from a kidney infection, but showing some concern and not seemingly brushing it off is frustrating when I felt like I was literally in that moment dying. My husband and I will be filing a complaint and I truly hope they do something to change the way they treat women. 

Thank you also for the well wishes! It sucks to be in the hospital, but I‚Äôm grateful for the care and compassion the nurses and doctors have shown me. Hopefully I respond well to the antibiotics and the pain let‚Äôs up!!

Suddenly I'm feeling something on my left upper thigh/ upper butt cheek. I'm looking down, because I thought my cigarettes might be falling out of my pocket or something, but it felt wrong. And then I notced a man sitting on the seat behind me. My mind instantly thought of the posts I've read here from women being groped on the bus. Women who have stayed silent, because they were unsure if what they were really experiencing it or because they've been taught to never make a scene. I've been taught the same. I'm dead scared of confrontation and I constantly doubt my self.

I'm also trying to learn self-love and building self-worth.

We're almost at our stop and we discuss getting off soon. I still wasn't sure if I was actually touched by the man behind me, but decided I would share it with my friend when we get off and discuss it with her.

Then he touches me again. This time on my right side.

Something fucking snapped.
I got up on my knees on the seat and turned around and looked down on the white man in his 30s in a grey track suit behind me. My voiced deepened and hardened as I ask him what the FUCK he thought he was doing. He didn't got a chance to answer before I loudly and firmly said that he should never EVER touch strangers on the bus. 

He answered in a tone where he was trying to sound inoccent and trying to make me out to be the crazy one in this scenario. People were looking at us now. ""I haven't touched you. I don't know what you're talking about"" he said. 

I said to him that he knew exactly what I was talking about, that he was a fucking creep and that he should never ever grope women agian. 

And then we got off. 
And I was so fucking proud. 

I wouldn't have done this 6 months ago, but I'm now doing the most self-loving thing there is: trusting myself.

And I made a fucking scene and that disgusting person had to sit there knowing that everybody in the bus knew that he was a creep who sexually assaults people.

I wanted to share it with you ladies, because one of the things that made me trust my instinct when I thought something might be off was you sharing your similar stories (Sidenote: I can also recommend reading The Gift of Fear), so now I want to share mine with you.

I still have to process the difficult emotions that come with being put in that situation, but sharing it with you is the first step in that proces.

The vast, vast majority of the comments have been supportive and you guys have shared your similar experiences and I so want to thank you for that. Sharing something like this, no matter how small or big the violation in itself was, is incredibly scary and I feel very vulnerable and overwhelmed right now.

1553887649.0,I terminated my pregnancy and killed the last trace of my husband that was left in the world.,"Title says it all really. When I was 23, I married the love of my life. We met in grade 10, we were high school sweethearts, dated all through college and got married after graduation. He was a wonderful, gentle giant of a man (6'5"", 240 lbs, big bushy beard, wore lots of flannel, great big smile that lit up his whole face). He was a social worker working with troubled teens at a group home. He was a survivor of abuse and neglect, and he was obsessed with helping kids who had a hard life like he did, being a role model for them, trying to show them there was another way than all the violence and anger. He was the best man I've ever known. I used to call him my oak tree. We were married for 7 months when he was killed in a car accident at 7PM on his way to the group home for a movie night with the boys. He died on impact. I'm told the other driver wasn't drunk, just negligent. I'm not quite sure why that would matter, but I can remember being told that like it was important information that I should know, and it's stayed in my mind.

I was devastated. I still am really, I've never gotten over it. Everything was ripped away from me in that moment, our life together, all our plans, all the years, everything stolen. I was a mess, I was completely out of my head. I stopped going to work, I stopped bathing, stopped eating. I would find myself wandering downtown sobbing without any idea how I got there. I would lie in bed for 20 hours at a time. I don't even remember his funeral, the only thing I can remember from that day is my mother dressing me because I couldn't do it myself. I was shell-shocked into a zombie just stumbling through the world.

At some point in those weeks I realized I was pregnant. I didn't tell anyone. I didn't know how to process it at that time. I can remember a moment, sitting in my room on our bed where he used to lie with me, thinking ""This is it"". That this was the thing I had been waiting for, the thing that would finally break me out of the feedback loop of grief that I had been locked in, the thing that would galvanize me into coming back to life and being a person again. I have never been religious or believed in God, but at that time I was certain that God had reached out and given me a gift that would heal my mind. Responsibility, a life to care for, a reason to start eating again, a reason to shower, to come back. I kept waiting to be filled with love for this last piece of him, of us, a love that would wake me up and give me purpose in life again. I kept waiting... but it never came. Nothing changed. I still felt utterly nothing, numb as a stone. I still kept forgetting to eat, I kept losing weight. I was pregnant and dropping pounds every week instead of gaining. Around the 20 week mark I terminated the pregnancy. She was a girl. I don't really remember much of that time either, I have very little memory of anything from that year. I can remember knowing that I couldn't care for her, that I had nothing to give her. I did the only thing I could do for her.

That was 22 years ago and there is still not a day that goes by that I don't think of her. Our beautiful girl would be 22 now, almost the age I was when I got married, standing at the beginning of her life with the whole world open to her. What would she be like now? What would she be doing? Sometimes I dream about her. I can see her face, see him in her, smiling at me. But I'll never see that face outside of my dreams because I erased her. I carry that with me every day. I could have kept her, I could have kept him alive through her. In reality, I know I'm the one who really killed him. I'm the one who ended the last trace of him and removed him from this world. I know people will disagree with that, but I also know that they're wrong.

I'm still pro choice. Even after everything, my views on that haven't changed. But I desperately regret it. I wish so much that I could have been stronger at that time, that I had been able to carry her into the world. Even if I had been able to carry her far enough to just give her up for adoption, at least she would be out there somewhere, I could at least know that part of him was still in the world. I know that I wasn't capable of it though. It took years before I was even close to okay, I couldn't have cared for her, I couldn't even maintain my own body long enough to sustain her through the pregnancy. I couldn't do it alone, not then anyway.

I'm just sad. I'm filled with regret and guilt and sadness every day. It's on my mind more now because this time of year is when he died, April is always hard but it never really goes away. I think about him all the time, and about her, and about the life that the three of us could have had together. That's all I guess. Just needed to talk about it and don't have anyone here except my cat.

After protecting myself and my identity in what ways I could, I told the wife. I found her number and texted her a brief, factual message that her husband cheated on her, the date we matched on Bumble, how I had no idea he was engaged or married, the fake last name and how he never mentioned her, but did mention other people in his life. I gave her a few screenshots to demonstrate that it went on over a series of months. 

She replied the next day thanking me. She said she was on her way to her parents' house and was planning on filing for divorce as soon as possible. She had been suspicious after testing positive for HPV about a month ago. As I (and you guys) suspected from the house being only in her name, apparently he is completely financially dependent on her and everything he told me about having investments and small businesses is a lie. I also found out that in addition to a fake last name, he gave me a fake phone number too. She cautioned that he may try to retaliate once she gives him the news, and she will message me before she gives him the papers so that I can go to a friend's house for a few days if I feel the need. 

It's been a stressful and emotional past few days. I'm upset that men like this exist. Proud of myself for telling her. Thankful to my friends and to all of you who encouraged me to tell her. Proud of her for leaving him. A little bit scared of what he will do.

It seemed to go well, until it didn't.

I have an early morning, so I suggested instead of going out and getting drunk, that we have some Baileys and coffee and call it an early night.

This was a TERRIBLE plan.

As soon as he crossed the threshold to my spot, he went from ""cute friend of BF"" to ""entry-level serial rapist.""

After pouring some coffee and staring to add some Baileys, he snuck up behind me and pinned me to my kitchen countertop.

So I grabbed a knife, pointed it at him and barked /screamed for him to leave. He didnt seem to believe me, until I forehead butted him away from my face and kicked/brandished the knife until he left out of my door. He STILL kept talking so I just kept screaming and barking orders at him to leave and for some one to call the police.

The cops showed up as he was waiting for the security gate to open up.

I have a card from the cop I made the report to. Im not sure what to make of this.

I'm happy to be safe.

But now my boyfriend thinks I was cheating on him. Even though it was my BF who offered up my place and couch for his friend to crash during his stay here. Its like, dude, why would i call the cops and pull a knife on someone I wanted to cheat with? That's not how cheating works.

In the morning i might not have a BF at all, and I'll have to deal with this creeper.

Why are dudes gross AF?!

1 - YES THE BOYFRIEND HAS BEEN DUMPED AND BLOCKED. I have no plans to ever talk to him ever again. This is a dealbreaking fuckup of epic proportion. Dating means you can break up with people for whatever reason you like and i look forward to dating someone new who lacks rapey friends, is self-aware and is not allergic to cats.

2 - The dude has been charged with assault/battery (to my understanding, this all happened like 8 hours ago, its a fluid situation for me right now) not rape. Why not rape? Because I kicked the shit out of him *before* it escalated to rape and unwanted touching is technically called battery. Experts who know more about criminally prosecuting this shitstain will fill me in on what all i need to know on the legals of this when they wake up today and get to work and reach out.

3 - Holy shit internets?! How are there so many people who set up their significant others with ""cheating tests"" that theres at least 20+ comments about it? Talk among yourselves about that.

4 - I am fine. Maybe PTSD hasn't set in yet. I'm going to sleep inside of my apartment and enjoy it. Maybe I'll repaint my kitchen or frame the knife (99 cents only store paring (?) knife, cuz I am a fancy bitch). The probability of this situation recurring is low, the guy left in a squad car. The ex is dumped, and later my locks will be changed. No, I'm not going to run to my brothers place and curl up in a ball because i have work and a life. I have a few bruises, but otherwise physically Im OK. Mentally, i plan to smoke a lot of weed after work and cash in a massage gift certificate.

1667464330.0,Please don't look away from the women's revolution that is happening in Iran.,"! TW: SA, murder, shitty misogynistic regime/system. !



I'm sure you've heard of Mahsa Amini on the news or on Twitter or in some hashtag somewhere on social media. 

She was a 22 year old girl who was killed by the Iranian ""morality police"" for having strands of hair out of her hijab.

Well, Mahsa is one of thousands. She is one of millions. Of tens of millions of girls who have been harassed and detained and ""re-educated"" by the morality police for having what they deem improper hijab. She is one of thousands of girls who are imprisoned right now for participating in anti-hijab protests, who have been raped, beaten, coerced, killed and the list goes on. 



Just one other example is 16 year old Nika Shakarami who very vocally participated in the front lines of a protest, chanting anti regime slogans, and burned her hijab. Her aunt, who was participating in the protest with her, last saw her being chased by authorities‚Äî they split up when fleeing. She was missing for a week, until they called her mother and aunt in to identify a corpse. The corpse's nose was smashed, as was her skull (with a baton). Her body was stitched up; her organs were not inside her. Using deductive reasoning looking at the history of the Iranian authorities, poor Nika was most likely raped and tortured for a week before she was killed.  Her family tried to hold a funeral for her in her home city‚Äî on her 17th birthday (she was killed just days before her 17th birthday). The authorities kidnapped her corpse and didn't allow the funeral because it sparked another protest.

There is so many stories like this but Nika's really hurts me the most. I've cried so much for her beautiful bubbly soul who just wanted a normal life with basic human rights, with the basic freedom she was BORN with.



There's so much more misogyny and patriarchal rule. Like how if you get married in Iran and your husband demands sex and you don't want to, he can call the police and they'll come to talk you into having sex with him, how it's your DUTY. If you get r*ped, there is no way for you to find justice, because you're married now, you are his property! Your husband can look for a second wife and commend and prefer the second wife to you if she is more willing for sex.


Let me make this clear before someone points it out: we call it a ""woman's revolution"", but men are victims of the Iranian regime, too. Our problem is greater than mandatory hijab and a misogynistic system. Our problem is corruption, government hypocrisy, money laundering by the government, poverty, extreme class differences (there are millionaires driving sports cars living in mansions while there are people who struggle to feed their families bread and water in the SAME CITY, let alone country). Our government ignores the tens of millions of poor Iranians and instead funds foreign armies (Palestine, Lebanon, etc) and spends money on nuclear weapons.



BUT what sparked the final crack that caused what is now becoming a revolution, was the death of an innocent young woman killed for not wanting to wear hijab. This is the Iranian women's revolution. This is the Iranian men's revolution. This is the revolution against misogyny and mandatory hijab. This is the revolution against a murderous, terrorist, corrupt government. 



Please do not look away. As an Iranian woman, the pain of Mahsa and Nika is MY pain. I AM Mahsa and Nika. I could literally have been either of them. They are my sisters. They are your sisters. Freedom, feminism, and equality is near for us Iranians. But we need your support. And all that is is for you to CARE, you to know what is going on in Iran. That is enough. If you want, participate in protests (there's been a lot of protests outside of Iran for Iran). I recommend joining r/NewIran (the r/ Iran and r/ Iranian subreddit is full of pro-regime scum and propaganda). This post isn't an advertisement for a petition, but if you want to do more to help, just ask and I'll tell you very simple things you can do just from your phone.

I would describe myself as a pretty awkward, shy, and insecure kid/teenager and the fact that James, who I found incredibly attractive, was interested in me blew my mind. 

One night James asked me if I wanted to hang out at his place (he lived on his own) so I lied to my parents and said I was staying over at a friends house. When I arrived, he offered me whisky and wanted to play a drinking game (I had never had alcohol before). The next thing I knew I was naked on the floor of the living room trying to push him off of me while yelling ‚Äúno‚Äù repeatedly. This was how I lost my virginity. 

The next morning, he offered to take me to Planned Parenthood to get plan b. There was no acknowledgement of what happened the night before. 

The next day, James joked with me that he wanted to marry me. My traumatized brain couldn‚Äôt make heads or tails of the immense guilt I felt about lying to my parents and feeling responsible for the rape itself. 

Four days after my 18th birthday, we married. I told my parents three months later and they kicked me out of the house. James was a manipulative narcissist, a compulsive liar, and emotionally abusive. I left him almost a year later. 

My parents have always been mad and disappointed in what they have perceived as a terrible and reckless decision I made when I was a teenager. I‚Äôve had a lot of time to think and process this year and finally decided this week to tell them exactly what happened that led me down the marriage path with James. It was one of the most healing moments of my life to be able to share what I went through. My parents were shocked and sad and most of all, loving and understanding. I feel lighter already. 

TL:DR I had a short marriage at 18 years old to a man that raped me and finally decided to tell my family, who were loving and understanding of what I went through.

EDIT: Holy shit! I just got out of my morning meetings and this has blown up. First of all, thank you all so incredibly much for the love and support. Your kindness is reverberating in me today and I can‚Äôt stop wiping the tears from my eyes. The ugliness of the situation itself somehow feels overpowered by the warmth you‚Äôre sharing today. Thank you. 

Some people asked about what happened afterwards. It took me four years to get the courage to go to therapy and tell my story. This was the first time I was told that I had been raped (prior to this I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what it was). I had also developed an eating disorder and alcohol problem and was using sex as a way of finding control. After a LOT more therapy I found my way to living a happy, healthy, and productive life. I‚Äôm single now, but have been able to experience truly loving romantic relationships. Today I am extremely happy, have a fantastic relationship with my friends and family, and continue to find ways to heal and move myself forward.

He worked a lot and because I would stay in the apartment to study and do freelance work during the day, I would also clean up a little. Even though we were both busy working, I didn‚Äôt have anywhere to drive. So I would clean his apartment for him once a week(beyond me cleaning up after my own self). It seemed fair because I was there a lot but didn‚Äôt pay rent, water, electric, etc. It was also out of love because he toured and had a crazy work schedule, and often came back exhausted.

A few days ago he called to see when I could return his apartment key, and I asked how he was feeling with all of my things gone. He said ‚Äúit feels a lot dirtier for some reason.‚Äù

I want to share with you something that just happened to me, because it ended up really being eye opening to me and I'm still a little bit amazed at the whole affair.

To understand what happened, you need to know two things - first the man I believed was the love of my life broke up with me out of the blue and it was a slap in the face, I'm talking weeks of crying. Second I'm struggling with mild social anxiety and lack confidence greatly. 

Anyway, a week after the break up, my friends dragged me to a party. My heart was still in pieces so I wasn't too much in the mood, but I went anyway. I tried my best too have a good time. 

Then I spot a man that is just unbelievably handsome. Tall, muscled, gorgeous smile and beautiful face, you know just all over hot. I saw him and my first reaction was ""There's no way a man that handsome would ever want to talk to a girl like me."" And let me just emphasize that I was not thinking about him taking interest in me or liking me or anything like that... I genuinely thought a guy like him wouldn't want any kind of contact with me. 

But then I fought ""Fuck it. Maybe he does actually... Who am I to suppose what he wants."" And you know, thinking I didn't have much too loose, I went over and introduced myself. We had a nice little talk, he was really nice and genuinely happy to talk. Then I let him go his way, went my own and enjoyed my night. We talked a couple more time that night and that was that. 

But after that night I figured it would be nice to see him again. I didn't have any hidden intention other than getting to know someone new. So I asked a common friend for his number and, after asking a panel of friends if that would be weird or perceived as an aggression, I sent him a little text that said ""Hey, it's Sabi from the party Saturday... Would like grabbing a coffee sometime ?"" 

Before sending it, my friends asked me if I was ready for him to say no. They asked me if he had a gf or if he was gay and to be fair, I had no idea. But I figured I didn't have much to loose. And I was ready for the fact that he might not want to hang out with me. And I thought that would be okay, that it wouldn't make me anything less as a person. 

After sending the text, I put the phone down and starting talking with my friends about how the worst would be waiting for his answer and maybe he wouldn't answer at all ? But before the conversation was over my phone lit up and I add a text saying ""Hey :) I would love that actually !"" 

At that point I was ecstatic... I couldn't believe it, the most handsome man ever willing to grab a coffee with me ?? WHAT ? 
We then arranged to meet the next day in the afternoon... Which was yesterday. And let me just say it went well :)
 It was everything I hopped it would be, an honest, pleasurable chat with a stranger, that lasted just a bit too long (6h!!) to be innocent but totally without any kind of pressure. But the thing I found out, the whole point of that story and what really blew my mind is how insecure that man is. He doesn't even see himself as handsome !!! Actually, the most handsome man I ever saw probably couldn't believe that a girl like *me* just texted him out of the blue... 

So this whole things got me thinking about how we perceive ourselves and other people... How we *think* other people perceive us. Maybe it's time to stop being so hard on ourselves, and wary of other people... 

Edit : For the people wondering, even though it's not really the point of the story, I'm a 26y/o French girl... You people all warmed my heart, you're awesome, and I'm really sorry for the couple grumpy people that seems to still be struggling big time with their insecurities.

1651765978.0,Turns out my bf is anti choice (prolife),"I (34f) had a difficult conversation with my bf (37m) last night. First of all he had no idea any of the Supreme Court stuff was going on. When I tried my best to explain it he said abortion should be illegal. I asked a few prodding questions like what about rape? Incest? Medical necessity? ""Well obviously that would be okay. But if you do it just because you don't want a kid then it's wrong. Like if you aborted my baby for no reason I'd have to kill you, ya know?"" I was flabbergasted, to clarify it wasn't like a threat, I'd like to think it was more to emphasize his point. I asked what about if a guy get a girl pregnant then abandons her? ""He didn't force her to have sex with him then she has to have the baby"" also something to the effect of that hardly ever happens (he has a good group of friends that have actually stepped up as dads so maybe that's just his perspective) I said but if it's my body it should be my choice, his response was ""once you're pregnant it's not just your body anymore"". I guess I'm just processing it all. I've always known we had different views on things. We're probably opposite sides of the political spectrum and I've been able to overlook it for the most part because he's a good guy but I'm not sure I can get over this one. I've had two abortions that he wouldn't agree with (before I met him) and I didn't have the heart to tell him about it. I don't think he would've listened anyway.

No, they are so against women's rights they made it so the attorney general won't be the one bringing about charges for any illegal abortions, instead, any anti-choice yokels that wish to fuck over women's rights are in charge of filing. (Sec. 171.208)

   Anyone who has have anything to do with the abortion can be charged by these asshats. Clinic escorts, insurance provider claims workers, people who drive the woman to get an abortion, janitors that clean the clinic, bosses who give time off for an abortion, people who lend money for them to get an abortion. People could potentially be charged for donating to Planned Parenthood under this law!(a)(2)

   The minimum penalty for being found to have ""aided and abetted"" an abortion is $10,000.(b)(2)
 Oh, and they want to claim that no federal court other than the Supreme Court can overturn these laws and the state will ignore all other rulings on this.(Sec. 171.211) (Sec.171.212)

Long story short: I got measles, as a 22 year old, in my first week of moving to New York.

The first day. I began feeling lethargic. I‚Äôd previously lived in North Dakota, so I assumed it was just the weather. The second day, I felt kinda worse, but again it was probably just the weather. Third day, it was getting really annoying now. So I took painkillers for a whole week. I was always in this slightly dizzy state, but I attributed it to like a flu or something.

Then the day after the first week, I wake up to an intense headache, and think I'm gonna die. I drive myself to Bellavue hospital and  I had an 105 fever. The doctor on duty immediately spotted that it was measles. Ok... MEASLES?? WHAT THE FRICK.

Well, yada yada yada, after the hospital did their medical stuff and prevented me from DYING, about a week later I was at a point where I could go out and do stuff, and not feel like death. But I never really recovered until like a year or 2 later. During that time, I kept getting sick because apparently measles completely ruins your immune system for awhile.

And now here I am alive, 2 years later. **Completely** up to date with vaccines. Guys, if you're on the fence about this, please just talk to a doctor. Your mom has the best intentions but isn't a medical professional. I still love her but sometimes you gotta do what's best for you.

After talking about this with her on/off, apparently her reasoning for not getting me vaccinated was that she hated making us cry as babies and also didn't want us to ""catch autism."" Thanks, mom.

1540842414.0,I had an abortion at 17 and I am so thankful.,"I am 27 now and am beyond thankful for my abortion 10 years ago.

I wasn‚Äôt on birth control and didn‚Äôt use a condom. It was the summer before my senior year. My high school boyfriend and I used the never reliable pull out method. I remember one day none of my clothes fit properly and it dawned on me that I was way more bloated than usual. 

Before taking a pregnancy test my boyfriend and I talked at length about what to do. He was 3 years older than me but lived at my house in his own room because his parents were shitty. We decided to keep the baby and make the best of it.

As soon as I saw the positive I was sick to my stomach and absolutely didn‚Äôt want this baby anymore. The fantasy sounded great but the reality of being 17 and pregnant terrified me.

My mom came home from work and I remember asking her to come upstairs with me so I could show her the test I took. I was crying and embarrassed. She didn‚Äôt believe it, convinced it was a false positive and made me an appointment with her OBGYN who actually delivered me and my little sister.

The OB confirmed I was 5 weeks pregnant. The nurse congratulated me- I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. After the sonogram I sat in the doctor‚Äôs office to discuss the next steps. He said I should come back for my next appointment in a month but then he asked if I wanted this baby. I shamefully told him I didn‚Äôt know. He asked if I thought about an abortion. He told me he could recommend a great women‚Äôs clinic and that physically I would be totally fine afterwards and could still have children later (I didn‚Äôt have any accurate education about abortion at the time). I immediately said that‚Äôs what I want. 

Now, I live in GA and was raised Lutheran. I went to a small private school from age 3-8th grade. My mom is religious and thought it important that I be raised in the church. She never really pushed religion once I got old enough to make my own decisions and we never talked about what she thought of abortion. I assumed she believed it was murder.

I told her I wanted an abortion. She told me I had to call the women‚Äôs clinic and make the appointment. My boyfriend was pissed. I don‚Äôt think he ever forgave me for my decision even though we stayed together for about 2 years after. He refused to go with me.

My mom took me to the clinic on the day of. We passed by protestors with signs of fetuses. We had to show our IDs to a security guard to prove we were supposed to be there.  There were so many other women there- the waiting room was packed. I checked in and insurance paid for about $400 worth. My mom paid for the rest. She sat in that waiting room for 8 hours while I went back, was interrogated about if I really wanted to do this, and forced to hear the heart beat. My mom helped me to the car after the procedure and after I came to, took me home and took care of me. We really never talked about it again.

I am now married to someone wonderful and we just had a baby of our own. Our son is 12 weeks old and all I can think about is how thankful I am that my life worked out this way.

I am so thankful for that older male OBGYN in GA that didn‚Äôt judge me and referred me to a safe clinic. I‚Äôm thankful there was a clinic near me. I‚Äôm thankful insurance covered part of it. I‚Äôm thankful my mom was supportive and could afford to pay for the rest of it. I had easy access to a safe abortion. It corrected a mistake that would have changed my life and gave me a better chance to succeed.

I will never stop fighting for women to have access to birth control, education, and safe abortions.

We did all the fun gyno stuff, and then it was time to draw blood.


I have THE world's worst veins. Every doctor/nurse I've ever had has said it. I usually get stabbed like a pin cushion. Before each stabbing, I always request that they draw blood from my hand, because it's way easier and the veins are better, plus it beats looking like a heroin addict. For example, the last blood test I had gave me 11 holes across both arms and both hands, and was really painful because they kept moving the needle around each time hoping to catch a vein.


The doctor said he would draw. 'Here we go,' I thought. He said he had to check my arms just in case (not sure if it was because he was doing his training or if that's standard procedure). When he felt my arms he kinda laughed and said ""so your hand is best?"" To which I replied, ""yeah, it's definitely the best way to go.""


His next response actually stunned me.


""Well, you know your body better than I do.""


And he proceeded to draw from my hand, getting it first shot (which has NEVER happened before, as the doctors/nurses usually take my lack of good veins as a personal challenge).


I couldn't believe it. I wasn't dismissed. I wasn't turned into a pin cushion for some weird medical ego boost. I was trusted to know my own body. And he listened and acted accordingly.

1597195145.0,Teach boys how to control themselves instead of teaching girls they need to cover up,"I work at a preschool that runs year-round. It has remained open during the pandemic with many restrictions. 

Edit: I live in America. As others have pointed out to me, this conversation would be different if I lived somewhere else. I‚Äôm sorry for not making this clear earlier.

Last week, I was getting ready to sub for a teacher who would be off for a few days. As she was preparing me to take over her class that consisted of 2-3 year olds, she told me about behavioral problems that come up a lot during the school day. 

She informed me that a little boy had made a habit of looking up a certain little girl‚Äôs dress when he could. (Side note: 2 year old boys aren‚Äôt naturally inclined to do this by any means. This is learned behavior) She said that if he kept doing it, I should put shorts on under her dress.

Instead of telling him to stop, I should just cover her up. What is this teaching her? That when boys do stuff like this, it‚Äôs because you need to cover up more? Absolutely not. So when the time came for me to sub in the classroom and he tried to look up her skirt, I pulled him aside and explained that we *never* do that. When his mom came to pick him up later that day, I informed her of what was happening and she proceeded to tell him the same thing. 

Since then, much to his teacher‚Äôs surprise, he hasn‚Äôt tried to look up her skirt again. If I had decided to do as she said and put shorts on under the little girl‚Äôs dress, there‚Äôs a good chance he would still be doing it. 

We need to teach young boys that behavior like this is not ok, and will not be tolerated. Instead, we continue to teach young girls that it is not only their fault, but also their responsibility to stop it. Whether it is putting shorts on under a 2 year old‚Äôs dress or making a female student put on a sweater because she wore a tank top to school, it‚Äôs all harmful to both boys and girls.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt not expect this post to blow up like it did. Thank you for all the kind words and awards.

I went about my skincare routine and went to bed a little after him. He leaned over to drink some water and guess what, no water! In the 16 years we‚Äôve lived together, he hasn‚Äôt done that particular ‚Äúchore‚Äù ONCE. I told him that shit doesn‚Äôt just happen by magic and turned off the light.

I fucking hate being this petty and I don‚Äôt really like myself very much right now. I finally opened up to a friend this afternoon; she has been through a divorce and had some good advice. I think my next step is to get an appt with a therapist, get my head on straight and figure out my next next step.

ORIGINAL POST:
Yesterday we had a huge fight about household chores. Yep, another post about one person carrying the household on their back and the other just living their best life but still somehow complaining they have to do everything.

My husband helps with laundry every Saturday and empties the dishwasher AT BEST once a week. That‚Äôs it. Last night he got pissed while he was drinking and decided to go clean his toilet and bathroom floor at like 10 at night with the ‚Äúwoe is me I can‚Äôt believe I had to do this‚Äù atitude and he kept arguing with me from the bathroom. I told him that just because he cleans his pissy bathroom once every three months that doesn‚Äôt make him fucking Cinderella.

I feel kind of childish but him saying that he has to do everything around the house got me seeing red. I went to bed without washing the dishes or clearing the kitchen at all. This morning I woke up, got my breakfast, did not touch the dishes. Got my coffee and sat in front of my computer, caught up on my shows and played my games. When I was done eating breakfast, I took my dishes in the kitchen (was feeling generous) and I just put them on the counter and left them there. I‚Äôm not going to do those dishes and I‚Äôm not cooking dinner. I‚Äôm just gonna do what he does every single day, do whatever I feel like doing and then either ask what‚Äôs for dinner or just show up to dinner when it‚Äôs time. Of course there will be no dinner, but still.

We have sat down and had conversations about this several times. ‚ÄúI bet my father never had to clean the bathroom‚Äù is the kind of response I usually get from him.

I thought about making a new account to post this with but then I thought, fuck that, I have nothing to be embarrassed about. I am a grown ass person, and I did nothing wrong. 

Except maybe not standing my ground sooner.

But then it happened. And I sat in the bathroom, panicking. Do I shove toilet paper in my panties? 

And then there were feet in the stall next to me. 

‚ÄúHey - I know this is weird, but do you have a tampon?‚Äù 

You didnt. 

But you did leave the bathroom, find a quarter, come back, buy me a tampon, and pass it under the stall.

This is mostly aimed at teenage girls/young women. But who knows! Maybe you learn something new aswell, even if you don't fit that category.

**PEE AFTER SEX**
Peeing after sex can help to flush bacteria out of the urethra, and therefore help avoiding an UTI.








**Sex shouldn't hurt your first time**
People make having sex with men as a woman for the first time sound like a complete horror story.
But I'm happy to say, it's not!
It's normal to feel a little sore afterwards, but it's not supposed to be painful.
Don't rush it, have fun with eachother. Make out, touch eachother, etc. 
If it's difficult to insert the penis or if it's painful, leave it be, and do some more foreplay.








**Your vagina is self-cleaning**
Vaginas are self cleaning. You never need to clean the inside of your vagina with water, soap or any other feminine hygiene products. 
The vulva can be cleaned with a gentle unscented soap if this doesn't irritate you, but can contribute to recurrent yeast infections or Bacterial Vaginosis for some people.
Using water alone to clean your vulva is what is recommended by medical professionals.











**Having stains on your clean underwear is normal**
The vagina has a acidic pH level, that's why discharge can leave stains on your underwear. It's completely normal, and that doesn't mean your underwear isn't clean.








**Semen can mess up your vaginas pH-level**
The optimal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5, which makes it acidic. 
Semen and soap have an alkaline pH, in the 7-9 range.
Because of this, the presence of semen can elevate your vaginal pH long after sex.
If you often have problems with UTIs after having sex, this may be the reason why.
The best way to deal with this is using a condom.

EDIT:
Lubed condoms can actually mess with your pH levels aswell.
Many popular brands of lube/condoms can irritate the vagina due to it's pH level.

- If a product is CE marked, it‚Äôs a confirmation that it‚Äôs safe for the bodily environment it was intended for, by European Economic Area (EEA) standards. Without this, there‚Äôs no confirmation that your lube product doesn‚Äôt contain anything that‚Äôs harmful to your vulva skin and vaginal pH.
- Avoid lubes/condoms that have flavors/fragrances such as fruity, floral, candy, etc.
- Avoid:¬†Glycerin(e), Propylene Glycol, Nonoxynol 9, Chlorhexedine Gluconate, Petroleum Oils, Polyquaternium-15, Benzocaine, Sugars & Sugar Alcohols, Ureas.

Thank you u/DiabloStorm for informing me about this!
Here's a guide about everything to do with lube, I highly recommed it: http://dangerouslilly.com/lube-guide






**80% of women don't orgasm from penetrative sex**
Can't seem to reach an orgasm during penetrative sex? You're definitely not alone!
The vast majority of women are only able to orgasm from clitorial stimulation, the clit is the only thing on the human body that exists for pleasure only, after all, experiment with it!
Don't accept that sex is done when he reaches an orgasm, when he didn't even try to pleasure you aswell.
Your pleasure is just as important as theirs.






**Most women don't bleed their first time**
In some cultures, a husbands family demands to see bloody sheets after the wedding night, to prove that the bride was a virgin. This is false.
Only 1 in 5 women bleed their first time, I didn't bleed the first time I had sex.
Bleeding or not doesn't prove if the women has or hasn't had sex before.
Quick note: If you're a woman who needs to prove her ""virginity"" by showing bloody sheets on her wedding night, and you're worried that you won't bleed, please DM me. There are multiple ways you can fake bleed, I can help you. Surgery is the worst thing you can do, there are different options that are much better!







**Nobody can look inside your vagina and determine if you've had sex or not**
There have been cases of people taking their girlfriends/daughters/wives to a gynecologist to see if they have stretched their hymen or not.
Like the rapper T.I, who took his 18 year old daughter to a gynecologist to get answers.
The truth is that no doctor or gynecologist can examine you to see if you've had sex or not, that's something only you know.
The hymen can stretch from doing everyday things, running, sports, riding a bike, etc. It has nothing to do with proving if you've had sex or not, it's just impossible to prove that. Some women are born without a hymen.
Please don't be discouraged to do sports and other things to avoid streatching your hymen.
There's help out there for women who need to prove their ""virginity"" to their boyfriend/father/husband this way. No person should ever do that to you. Please DM me if you're in that situation, I will more than gladly help you.
Virginity is a made up concept to make people feel ashamed about their sexual experiences or lack there of. Again,  nobody can determine if you've had sex or not.

EDIT:
Thank you u/Chickiri for posting this great and informative comment:

""While it's not possible to tell wether you're a virgin or not based on the state of your hymen alone, there are ways to detect wether or not you've had sex, which are especially important in the case of rape. If you've been raped/fear you've been raped (if you feel like maybe you've been drugged/intoxicated/any other situation), please seek a professional: this is very important for your health, and for any legal action you might want to take.""

This is very important, it's completely understandable if you're afraid to report it. But please go to the hospital first thing, don't shower or change clothes. They will help tremendously, and they won't force you to report if you don't want to.






**Having large labia minora is normal**
Labiaplasty is getting more and more popular amongst young women, because they feel like their vulva is ""abnormal"".
It isn't, every single vulva is normal. There is not a ""right"" way for a vulva to look. 
There's a woman and activist called mediclit on twitter, she got a labiaplasty at 18. The procedure left her mutilated, and she no longer have any feeling in her clitoris. If you're interested in this topic, I suggest checking her out.
Please be safe!








**It's totally normal for one boob to be bigger than the other**
It's way more common to have asymmetrical boobs than have symmetrical ones. It's actually very rare to have perfectly symmetrical boobs, don't worry about it!
That being said, if you suddenly develop asymmetry, like a sudden increase or decrase in volume of the boobs, you should get that checked out. That‚Äôs especially true if that change comes with other symptoms like skin retraction, or thickening,¬†dimpling, or a change in color of your breast. 








**You can get pregnant during your period**
It's very unlikely, but it's not impossible.
Once inside a woman, sperm can wait for an egg for up to a week. Ovulation can occur soon after, or even during, the bleeding phase of a woman's menstrual cycle, giving the sperm the chance to get lucky.¬†








**The vagina does not become ""loose"" if you have alot of sex**
Ever wondered why men say a woman who've slept with a 100 men have a ""loose"" vagina, but a woman who slept with the same man a 100 times doesn't? Me too!
This is simply a slut-shaming tactic, it isn't true. 
Virginity is a social construct, and who many people you've sex with is nobodys business, and it doesn't determine your worth.
The vagina can push out an entire baby and go back to its normal size, a dick won't change shit.






**Birthcontrol isn't only for avoiding pregnancy**
I had very painful periods as a teenager, had all horrible sideeffects you could think of.
My mom suggested that I tried birthcontrol. Her suggestion made me feel embarrassed, I associated birthcontrol with having sex, and I hadn't had sex before at that age.
She explained that you can go on birthcontrol even if you aren't sexually active, and she's absolutely right.
There's many reasons why a woman would choose to go on birthcontrol, preventing pregnancy is only one of many.






**Penetrative sex isn't the only way to have sex**
This annoys me alot. As a bisexual woman, I've been asked numerous times how two women have sex. They never ask how two men have sex, why? Because a dick is involved.
This is especially irritating considering that only 20% of women are able to orgasm that way.
To clarify, sex isn't just being able to orgasm either. But it annoys me that many men totally ignore the part that makes women reach climax, and won't even consider it sex.
Sex is so much more than just penetration, have fun with it, explore.




**Vaginal discharge 101**
I used Mama Doctor Jones video about discharge to provide pictures to better show what I mean. Thank your everybody who suggested her channel in the comments, very informative, and I highly recommend checking her out, you can find her video [here] (https://youtu.be/KHF8mB_8LUM)

Discharge is a completely normal bodily function that cleans and protects the vagina.
Your vaginal discharge can vary depending on your cycle, and it can vary from person to person.
Some of us have alot, some of us have less, it's completely normal.
I do not recommend wearing pantyliners on a daily basis to prevent getting discharge on your underwear, it can irritate the skin of the vulva. 

**Healthy/Normal discharge**
The color of vaginal discharge more commenly white or off-white, but sometimes it can have a bit of a yellow hue, and sometimes it can have a more transparent look.
[Here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHfQyZ.jpg) are some examples of normal consistencies and colors of discharge.

*In the absence of any other symptoms*, these consistencies are completely normal:

- Watery/Clear

- Gel-like ""stringy"" discharge, normally happends before ovulation.

- Also consistencies that I included in the photo.

Your discharge may be a brownish color, this is also normal, reference photo [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHDEfo.jpg)
This is called spotting.
Spotting¬†is defined as light vaginal bleeding that happens outside of your regular periods.
This kind of brown discharge can often happend at the end of your cycle. It's old blood mixed with discharge, which creates a brown-like color.

**Abnormal discharge**
First of all, it's important to recognise how your discharge usually smell like. It shouldn't smell foul, but it's normal to have a smell or lack of it. If it does have a funny smell, it's a sign that you should get it checked up.

Cottage cheese-like chunks in your vaginal discharge, looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHlZIV.jpg)

This can often signify a yeast infection.
Especially if it's followed by any of these symptoms:

- Genital Itching 

- Swelling

- Redness 

- Burning sensation while peeing or having penetrative sex

- Your discharge might smell a little ""off"" if you have a yeast infection, but it can also have no odor at all.


TREATMENT:
If it's your first time having an yeast infection, or if you're unsure if it is an yeast infection or not, make an appointment to your doctor.

Otherwise, you can buy a over-the-counter yeast treatment. (Not recommended for pregnant women, book an appointment)
If your symptoms persists, book an appointment.

Don't be embarrassed if you have a yeast infection, it's very common but unpleasant. Don't be afraid to seek treatment.

To reduce your risk of vaginal yeast infections: 

- Wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly.

Avoid:

- Tight-fitting pantyhose

- Douching, which removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection

- Scented feminine products, including bubble bath, pads and tampons

The following may increase your likelihood of yeast infections:
- Stress

- Diabetes

- Use of birth control pills

- Pregnancy

- Antibiotics, especially prolonged use over 10 days




Alot of yellow discharge that looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHs8JF.jpg) especially if you have other symptoms could indicate chlamydia.
A slight yellow hue can be normal in certain situations. But if you feel other symptoms, or if you recently had sex with a new person, you should get that checked out.
Remember! Some people don't have any symptoms when they have chlamydia. Untreated chlamydia can result in serious health complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease.
That's why it's very important to use a condom when having sex, and get tested if you have any doubts.

If you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STDs, seek medical treatment.

Lime green discharge, that kinda looks like mucus in my opinion, reference [here]
(https://pasteboard.co/JZHvzad.jpg)
And [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHvNlq.jpg)
If you have a new sexpartner or in any situation where you can be at risk for STI or STDs, this can indicate gonorrhea or trichomoniasis.

Symptoms of¬†trichomoniasis:
- Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals

-Discomfort with urination

-A change in their vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish with an unusual fishy smell

Symptoms of gonorrhea:
- an unusual¬†vaginal discharge, which may be thin or watery¬†and green or yellow in colour

- Pain¬†or a burning sensation when peeing

- Pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area  (this is less common)

- Bleeding between¬†periods,¬†heavier periods¬†and bleeding after sex¬†(this is less common)

If you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STD, seek medical attention.

If your discharge have a thin, gray color, it can indicate bacterial vaginosis. Couldn't find a good reference photo for this one, sorry about that.

What is bacterial vaginosis?
Bacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of bacteria naturally found in the vagina, which upsets the natural balance.

Symptoms:
- Grey-like discharge

-Discharge have a strong fishy odor

- Burning feeling when you pee

- Itching

50% of women do not have any symptoms.

When to see a doctor:

-You have vaginal discharge that's new and associated with an odor or fever. Your doctor can help determine the cause and identify signs and symptoms.

- You've had vaginal infections before, but the color and consistency of your discharge seems different this time.

- You have multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. Sometimes, the signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are similar to those of bacterial vaginosis.

- You try self-treatment for a yeast infection with an over-the-counter treatment and your symptoms persist.






**Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**
TSS is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins.
This can affect both men, women and children.
Risk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons.
Having your tampons in for longer than 8-12 hours can increase the risk of an infection or TSS.

Symptoms:
The symptoms of toxic shock syndrome start suddenly and get¬†worse quickly. They include:

- A high temperature

- Flu-like symptoms, such as a¬†headache, feeling cold, feeling tired or exhausted, an aching body, a¬†sore throat¬†and a¬†cough

- Feeling and being sick

- Diarrhoea

- A¬†widespread sunburn-like rash

- Lips, tongue and the whites of the eyes turning a bright red

- Dizziness¬†or¬†fainting

- Difficulty breathing

- Confusion

TSS is very rare, but these symptoms should absolutely not be ignored, if you experience these symptoms, contact medical emergencies immediately. If you're using a tampon while experiencing these symptoms, remove it straight away. Inform medical staff if have used a tampon while experiencing these symptoms.

1679926666.0,I Hung A Jury (TW-Rape),"TRIGGER WARNING - RAPE

Throwaway account for privacy reasons. DM's are off, don't waste time with the RedditCares, boys.

Middle aged woman, US based. I was selected to sit on the jury for a rape case last week.

I take doing jury duty extremely seriously.  It is a very important civic duty and I don't complain about being called to serve. I served on a jury in a death penalty case in the past. I did not want to serve on this particular jury when I heard what it involved, but I was selected.

The defendant and the victim were both teenagers at the time of the incident; the defendant was being tried as an adult (three years later). No physical evidence, only the testimony of the two individuals involved and three police officers involved in the investigation(s) There were other things involved that we didn't get to hear about; one was brought up and the defense attorney threw a huge fit and got it struck from the record, others were alluded to but never fleshed out.

We had to decide based solely on our own interpretations of the stories and credibility of the witnesses.

I listened very carefully, without bias, to all of the testimony. I made my decision only after hearing all of the judge's instructions and then spending that night (sleeping very little) considering everything.

My decision? He raped her and he did it forcefully. She told him she did not want to have sex - repeatedly, before he did it and while he was doing it. She was stuffed into the corner of a back seat of a small coupe with a body much larger than hers on top of her. She couldn't get away. He raped her until finally he listened to her, stopped and took her home.

I was the only one of 12 who voted guilty.  And I got abused for it. I was accused of ignoring the judges' instructions, that I had made my mind up before the defendant even testified. One (very) old man told me that I had to vote not guilty because everyone else had reasonable doubt (senile much????). Another old man talked over me every time I spoke. Several other people interrupted while I was trying to make points (if the one old dude wasn't already talking over me). Most of them couldn't understood that force does not have to include violence or even the threat of violence. Two of the WOMEN even insisted that her getting into the back seat of the car was consent, didn't matter that she  repeatedly told him that she did not want to have sex.

Surprisingly enough, I held my temper. I didn't yell. I didn't use personal attacks in any of my arguments, despite being attacked repeatedly (I had a whole list of names I wanted to call them in my head).  I very quietly and firmly told them I did not appreciate how they were acting and that I was not going to continue to discuss this if they could not do so as adults.

They could not. The old men continued their antics, but I worked for years in male dominated industries. I'm not a doormat. I stopped being a people pleaser a long time ago. IDGAF what they think about me. I knew I was right. I stood my ground.

The jury foreperson sent a note to the judge.

The judge made us come back after a lunch break and continue deliberating. We listened to a reading of the testimony again. I listened intently, with an open mind, trying to catch anything that might give me some reasonable doubt.

My decision was not changed. We attempted to discuss it further and it was obvious that they weren't going to walk over me like they were the other women on the panel.  We went back to the courtroom and the judge declared a mistrial.

Afterwards, I spoke to someone from the DA's office. I told her everything, including the fact that I had strongly considered not coming back from lunch that day. Then I walked out to my truck and stood there smoking a cigarette. I needed some time to settle down before driving home.

A few minutes later a couple walked over to me.  It was the victim's parents. The DA had told them who I was and what I had done (I had said I was okay with talking to them). The woman asked if she could hug me and told me I was her angel.

Because I believed their daughter.

I hugged both of them and we all cried a few tears.

And then they told me what we weren't allowed to hear. There are three other girls that POS raped. None of them would testify. He had locked one of them in a basement for three days. He had already been tried in juvenile court and gotten a plea bargain and refused to turn himself in over the past three years since he raped her.

I wish I could be a fly on the wall if/when the other jurors discover that information.  Because even though I did what was right, it's going to haunt me for the rest of my life.

So yeah, that's it. I hung that jury. And today there's a teenage girl who knows that someone believed her.

And that alone made the whole experience worthwhile.

EDIT TO ADD -

Since so many have asked, I won't give exact details as to what made me not believe him (public forum, privacy). There were several things in his story that were inconsistent with what, from what my young friends have told me, a teenage boy would do during consensual sex. There were also far too many little details in his story that I doubted he would remember considering that almost a year had passed between the incident and when he found out he was being charged with rape for it.",TwoXChromosomes
1632929161.0,I just reported my former best friend to the FBI,"I feel awful, but it needed to be done.

I grew up with her. We did everything together. She was such a beautiful, kind-hearted free spirit. Then she got married to a conservative guy, and they moved to the bible belt. She became an evangelical Christian, and we drifted apart because we became too different. I still have her on my Facebook friends list, and it hurt to see her turn into an anti-vaxxer, anti-masker, and hardcore Trump supporter. She constantly spews hate on Facebook. She's a homophobic person who, like many evangelical Christians, also looks down on working women ""because women belong in the kitchen"". I don't know who she is anymore.

The other day, she posted a cruel diatribe against President Biden because he mandated vaccines for the military and companies with 100+ employees. In the comments section, she, her husband, and their Trumper friends said things like, ""If Biden keeps this up, we'll have another January 6th event. And it'll be real this time. We're ready.""

I took that as a threat against the President, the Congress and other government officials. ""This time it'll be real"" is pretty telling. They're implying that more people -- important people -- will get hurt this time. So I reported them to the FBI.

I feel bad for doing that. I miss my friend, but she's not that person anymore.

1615894367.0,My daughter was touched in a way that made her feel uncomfortable.,"TL:DR. My 7 year old daughter was touched in a way that made her feel uncomfortable, everybody believed her, nobody downplayed it and the situation was dealt with kindly.



Last week, my daughter told me a boy in class was petting her hand and leg while they sat on the carpet during class time.  She told him ‚ÄúStop‚Äù and when that didn‚Äôt work she told him to move over (which also didn‚Äôt change his behavior.)

I found out about it after she had already told her older sister (she‚Äôs 9).  Her sister told her, ‚ÄúI would march right up to my teacher and tell her I don‚Äôt like it when he touches me!‚Äù

When she told me her plan to talk to her teacher, I asked if she wanted me to come with or if she felt comfortable saying it on her own.  She wanted me to come, so we went together.  (Just as a Covid aside: I work at my school.  Parents are not allowed on campus right now).

The teacher squatted down and looked her in the eyes.  She took what she said seriously and, best of all, did not downplay her discomfort in the situation.  She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you told me.‚Äù  She made changes on the carpet and talked to the boy (in a teaching way).

Reflecting back on it, I‚Äôm really glad everybody around her believed her and validated/respected her objection to being touched in a way she didn‚Äôt like.  And the boy was taught about correct behavior.  

I, like I am sure many others on this sub, have my own history of not being believed when I reported unwanted touch/‚Äúaffection‚Äù/advancements from guys.  Also, reported harassment and was told, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs old, so it‚Äôs no big deal.‚Äù

1589335077.0,My boyfriend from high school messaged me out of the blue today to apologize for pressuring me into sexual situations when we were 16.,"Edit: Here's your typical ""wow! this really blew up!"". But for real, thank you for your overwhelmingly positive responses to this, especially towards his actions of trying to right a wrong. It's also been overwhelming to read how many people have experienced varying degrees of sexual assault in their lives, but at least we all have this reminder that we're not in this alone, despite what it often feels like. You're all amazingly strong. <3

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if stuff like this is allowed here, but I needed somewhere to process this and share this with other women who might see how incredible this is.

When I was 16/17 (I'm 27 now) I dated a boy in my high school. He was pretty much my first everything for sexual experiences. I was raised in a very conservative and religious household, so a lot of the stuff we ended up doing took a lot of pressuring on his part. It was never forceful, but it was pressure, it caused me a lot of stress at the time, and really changed how I viewed my worth based on my sexuality.

Honestly, I haven't really thought about that portion of our relationship in years with the exception of it occasionally coming up as a contributing factor in other problems during therapy. He and I remained friendly over the years, but never talked about anything serious or even more than the occasional comment on someone's Facebook post.

Today he messaged me out of the blue. It was long and I could tell he put a lot of thought into it.  He basically stated that due to the passing of time/aging/and now working as a victim advocate for survivors of violent crimes for our state, he has been reflecting on his past behavior and has felt really guilty for it. He apologized for bringing it up and also for waiting 11 years to apologize for pressuring me into things. He said basically he wasn't sure how I saw it, but from where he stood he was in the wrong and he felt awful about being ""that person"" in my life.

I was completely blown away. Not only because I hadn't expected this now or ever, but because I don't think I realized until that moment how much I needed that. Also, that was a really brave thing he did. It's been 11 years, he didn't have to apologize ever. He didn't even have to think about it if he didn't want to. But he did, and he brought it up to me, and he apologized for his behavior like a man. To top that all off, it really let me put other things in perspective. For example, if pressure ""wasn't a big deal"", then maybe feeling trapped or feeling unable to say no to other guys wasn't either. The fact that he was completely owning what he did and refusing to mitigate it, which pales in comparison to what other exes did, really shines a light on how serious the ""little stuff"" is.

I don't know. I feel like I'm rambling now, but it gave me a new respect for him and lifted my standards of what men can do when they decide to own their stuff and be accountable. Never in a million years did I think I'd see this day. It's bittersweet in a way, but I'm glad it happened and I hope it gives us both more peace.

1561030870.0,"In two hours, I'll be getting my tubes tied at 23 with no kids. This is only being allowed because of my husband, not me.","EDIT: I did not expect this story to gain traction! I just got home and I will be trying to respond as best I can. Thank you everyone for the kind words, and for those who are confused about why I am getting my tubes tied as a response to bad periods, it is also an endometrial ablation, which will stop the bleeding. 

Long story incoming, but it has a happy ending, I swear. TL;DR at the bottom. 

I am 23 years old, I have been menstruating since I was 11, and it has never, ever been regular or normal. Periods would last for weeks or even months on end. I didn't have health insurance growing up, so this was never looked at and I had to just ignore it. The worst part was I knew even at 10 I never wanted to be a mother. It felt like just a punishment to me. 

At 16, I met my boyfriend - now husband - and I knew he was something special. Seven months into our relationship, we wanted to finally have sex. I told my mom, who had my older brother at 19, and she immediately drove me to Planned Parenthood. I had Implanon put in my arm, and we were good to go. (Before the age topic comes up, the age of consent in our area is 16; every single thing we ever did was my choice and my choice alone. He always made me choose what we did.)

Except I bled for 11 months solid. 

I eventually had to pay almost $1,000 to get it removed from my arm, begging for it to go away. The anxiety, stress, depression, bleeding, it was all too much. 

Now, my boyfriend is a bit older than me and he made a decision at that point to get a vasectomy, even with how young he was. His family has a series of medical issues that he doesn't want to see kids have, the both of didn't want kids, and we knew if we changed our minds, morally, it was better to adopt. The doctor let him do this without question. Literally. He made the appointment, got snipped, and that was that. Under the age of 25. 

Fast forward to now, I've been hopping between doctor to doctor for any help because my periods still would never stop. They'd go away for a few months, then come back with a vengeance. I knew it was PCOS, and almost all the women in my family have had to get a  hysterectomy for it. I was begging for it and my story was always the same: I don't want kids, I've made this choice since I was 10, and I am not changing my mind. No one listened. All the doctors would just prescribe a new birth control, then send me on my way. It was killing me. 

Now, thankfully, I work for a state institution and have fantastic health insurance. I, also, have an amazing coworker who recommended I look into Endometrial Ablation. We had a specialty clinic for it even in our town. 

I called on Tuesday for the appointment and the nurse scheduled me on Wednesday, next day, due to a cancelation. I was excited. I read all the information on it I could and I was jumping for joy that this might be the solution I need. 

Come Wednesday, I go. The nurses, everyone, they're great. I sit down, I get comfortable, and the doctor comes in. Doesn't introduce himself.

""You're 23 and you don't have kids!""

Insert the first hour of him trying to tell me how he isn't going to do this because of my age and lack of children. Except he saw I was married and asked about my husband's opinion. 

I explained the above and that he had a vasectomy. 

The doctor mulled that over, then sent me to get an ultrasound so they could check things. Shortly after, he invites me back to his office for a consultation. 

His words were, ""You're going to make me bend my rules for two reasons: Your situation warrants it and your husband had a vasectomy.""

I didn't let my anger show then, I thanked him and scheduled the procedure. They asked when, I said as soon as possible, and today, less than 48 hours after calling the office, I will be getting an endometrial ablation and my tubes tied. 

I am thankful he bent his rule, but the absurdity of not being able to make my own decisions as a woman who has spent over half of her teenage and young adult life bleeding out of her vagina, I believe I should get to make the choice that is going to improve the quality of my entire life. 

TL;DR - Grow up with terrible, neverending periods. First boyfriend/now husband gets a vasectomy so I don't need to be on hormonal birth control. Things get worse, I go to a specialist for endometrial ablation and the doctor only agrees to do the procedure because my husband had the vasectomy, not my opinion or choices whatsoever.",TwoXChromosomes
1483064030.0,I'm so proud of my fianc√© and I want to share this little story with you,"Today we were babysitting two of our nieces( 4 and 6 years old). They start screaming in the room where they were playing while my fianc√© and I cooked lunch. 

We immediately ran into the room to see what happened and there was a small hairy scorpion that somehow got into the house. It's good they screamed because these things are nasty little demons. 

So my fianc√© runs and picks up the scorpion before it has a chance to scurry away.

Now what makes this worth posting: as my fianc√© was getting the scorpion, the oldest niece said that it was good that he was there because ""girls can't deal with that stuff.""

So my fianc√©  (hereafter referred to as Alex [I'm a liar. I'll never call him Alex again]), immediately asks her who told her that. She shrugged her shoulders and said that everyone knows girls can't deal with bugs and snakes (this is arizona, btw)

So he calls her over and tells her that girls are just as good as boys and that she should never think she can't do something because she's a girl. 

She said that she thought girls were ""supposed to be scared of bugs"". He told her, ""You never have to be afraid of something because youre a girl. You just have to be smart. Like when you saw this scorpion and you called me and your aunt in here. That was very smart of you and im proud of you for letting adults know about something that was a danger to you. You recognized there was something that could hurt you, and you got help. You are every bit as smart and strong and capable as any boy out there.""

He held the scorpions tail  with his fingers and held it in the palm of his hand. She started to look more and more confident and brave as she stood there with him. 

 He  explained to her that as she grows up people are always going to try to tell her what she can and cannot do, but that she can do anything if she puts her heart and mind into it. He told her there are women that work with bugs for their jobs and study them. She got so excited at the thought of a woman being able to do things a man can do. 

At this point her little sister has worked her way over to look at it too. So he sits there and explains the different parts of it and what they're for. Completely captured their imaginations.

The oldest girl asked if she could hold it. So he put it on her hands while he held the pinches and the tail and she held the scorpion in her hands. She was so proud of herself she talked about it until she went to sleep. 

I'm pregnant so it just makes me proud that our daughter, if we have a girl, will grow up with a father that believes in her.

1538953565.0,"He's finally dead, and I am happy.","My cousin raped and ""experimented"" with me for three years, ages 4-7, and he was 9-12. The norm; threatening to hurt me if I told, threatening to touch my little sister if I told, etc. I never told anyone - I just wrote it in my diary. When I was 9, my parents didn't understand why I was going through a horrible attitude phase. They snooped into my room and found my diary and confronted me. 

My dad drove two hours, walked into the house, and started to beat him. His brother, my uncle, pulled him off and they then fought. My dad told him what they found out, and they denied it. He denied it. Called me a liar. They said their ""sweet baby boy would never hurt another person"". They said if my father didn't leave, they'd call the cops. My parents filed a report against him, but due to a lack of concrete evidence, the case just fell through the cracks as most cases do. I was young, it was always dark, I was imaginative, I never told anyone, I never complained,  it had been too long since the last time it happened so obviously there was no DNA evidence to collect, etc., etc., so the case fizzled. I don't remember that time period much. I believe my brain repressed the memories, and I'm okay with that honestly. I was too young. 

My parents stopped talking to them. They still talked to my grandma and a few aunts, the three people in the family that believed me and cut all ties to him & those protecting him. Even after two more girls in the family came out and said he touched them too. Again, swept under the rug by my family. No one said or did anything. 

What I heard of him after was all through the grapevine and news reports - kicked out of three schools for bullying and groping female students, cheating, smoking, drinking, bothering a female teacher. None of which went anywhere, the victims always seemed to drop their cases against him. The schools didn't take it seriously in the first place, ""boys will be boys! He didn't mean it like that!""

He was disgracefully kicked out of the army for drug use AND verbally harassing a female sergeant. He was dishonorably discharged. Legal matters related to the drug use began. 

He impregnated a girlfriend of his and she aborted - later she admitted to her family he raped her. She didn't want sex, he did. He got what he wanted. She paid the price by a scarring experience, twice. 

He was arrested countless times for possession of methamphetamines and opioids. Sexual assault. Harassment. Fighting a police officer. Public intoxicating. Breaking & entering. Petty theft. Grand theft auto. Two counts of domestic abuse. Cashing fraud checks. Syphoning gas. Gambling on the streets, being a scam artist. The list continues. 

Last year, a girl in their small town disappeared. He was the last one seen with her as they left the little family owned market they worked at together. She was never seen again. Her family often requests news stations post her photos, begging for tips or ideas on where to find her. He says he dropped her off at the end of her street and she said she'd walk home. They deny her ever coming home as expected that night. I cry for them, because deep inside we know he did something to her. Of course, it's a town with a population of ~700 and just as astonishingly poor and rampant with drug and alcohol abuse. The store has no security cameras. There's no proof he was with her. That he did something to her. But I know he did.

My uncle desperately hangs onto him still, letting him crash on his couch and giving him money for ""food"" (he knows his son uses the money for drugs and/or alcohol). Invites him to the family parties he throws. My cousin's behavior and pattern of destruction caused a divorce between him & his wife, my now ex-aunt. She has given up on her son. He just can't seem to accept the fact that he's a monster.

Don't get me wrong - I feel for my uncle. It was wrong of him to deny what his son did to me, but I can't even imagine the confusion and suffering of hearing the child you raised has the potential of harming another human being. That pain must hit deep inside. I pray my uncle finds peace, accepts he was a good dad to him when he was a kid, and it's not his fault his son turned out to be a monster. Sometimes, no matter how well they're raised, or how loved they are, people just turn out to be evil. I pray my uncle comes to terms with the fact that his kid did do damage. I pray he seeks help to cope with this whole matter. I also hope my uncle apologizes to me and admits he was wrong, but that's a whole other messy thing. I pray that time will come. 

I received a call from my dad today while in class. He never calls me, so I knew it was something big. He told me to look up my uncle's Facebook page - it's not private at all, so I could see his posts. He posted a woefully written update about the tragic death of his son. How he went to check on him at the trap house he knows he stays at four and a half weeks ago, and how he found him dead. Already dead for three days, the autopsy report later confirmed. Needle still in his arm. He overdosed on heroine, which turned out to be tainted with Fentanyl. The Midwest is having a true epidemic of these cases lately, and it's not uncommon to hear about ODs daily. 

I cried. I cried happy tears. He is dead. He is fucking dead. No longer will he terrorize women, fight men that try to better him, steal from people, abuse people, ruin property, vandalize, ignore all authority, rape and impregnate, threaten to harm, potentially fucking murder, and just in general wreak total havoc. He is fucking dead and he cannot harm another soul. 

I have received many years of therapy for what happened to me. I have accepted it wasn't my fault, and although it hurt me it can't and WON'T control my future. My life is still mine to decide what happens... but I would be lying if I said all of these years I wasn't scared he would come back to hurt me again, hurt my little sister, or anyone else on this planet. He was a terror. I felt like I just had to watch a monster destroying anything it touched for two decades. Before therapy, I felt it was all my fault. I felt so guilty. I now understand it was nobody's fault but his. 

He made his choices. He continuously hurt people - innocent people, and the people that loved him and tried to get him help. He chose to use drugs. He chose to shoot up that day, and it just happened to be his last choice. 

He's finally dead, and I am so fucking happy.

I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for about 2 months and last night we were in an uber (being driven by a woman) heading out to dinner. 

Almost immediately after getting on the road there was a really loud squeaking/scraping sound coming from the passenger side of the car. He listened for a couple of minutes and asked the driver how long she had been hearing the noise. She said it had just started right before she picked us up. 
     
He then asked her ‚Äúcan you pull into this gas station up here and I‚Äôll have a look?‚Äù She did and we all got out. She and I stood back as he jacked up her car and got down on his knees to look around. In a matter of seconds he found and fixed the problem. (A small rock was stuck behind the heat shield). A simple fix for someone who knows what they are doing. 

I know if it were my car, I would have been stressed and worried about it being a major problem and having to take it to a mechanic to be fixed. Not to mention it potentially costing a lot of money. 

When we got back on the road, all I could do was look at him in awe. I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. He went out of his way to help another person without a second thought.

Since it's his first charge, he's facing up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $5000. He would not be required to register as a sex offender. If he commits a second offense of sexual battery, he would then be required to register and would face between 1 and 5 years in jail.

A while ago I lend a friend my ice scraper. I had to go, so I just gave it to him and told him to just give it back when we see each other again. Due to an ineffective lockdown he had it all winter, we didn't meet all those months. 

Now the weather is really nice and I walked in long jeans and a tshirt along the street, enjoying the sun. I crossed the street, then I heard a car honking. I ignored it. It honked again. I ignored it again. Again honking, and without looking behind me I just raised my middle finger in the general direction of the honker and continued walking. Then I heard a car slowing down next to me. I apruply turned 180¬∞ around, walking where I came from. 

Then I heard a familiar voice shouting ""Hey, (my name), what's up with you?"". It was my friend in that car. I walked back and greeted him. Upon asking why I reacted like I did, I anwered: ""Do you have ANY idea how many cars honk at me? If I reacted to every single one of them, I'd do nothing else!"" He took a closer look at my clothes (not too tight, not really lose, just plain casual clothing. No suggestive skin showing, nothing) and I could see he doubted. 
He changed topic and grabbed my ice scraper from the passenger seat. ""Hey, finally I can give it back!"" I leaned forward to take it, in that moment a car with some guys in it drove past. They honked, shouted ""Hey! Can you make me an offer too?"" and drove off with an awful loud engine. I showed absolutely no reaction, my friend was flabbergasted. ""Did that just really happen?"" I said: ""Well, that's just standard stuff that I hear every other day."" 

He was completely shocked and disgusted. He apologized for honking at me at first and said he'd just call me next time or just walk up to me. 

Later he told me (about 3 hours after the incident) that he can't just stop thinking about what happened and that he wants to ask his coworkers at lunch break if they ever experienced something like that.

I hadn't eaten at all, and after I was done I just wanted to treat myself to some fast food and decompress somewhere. Got myself a bag of sliders and a hot chocolate, and decided to check out a nearby forest preserve in Will County, in the far southwest suburbs of Chicago. It was a lovely day with spring in full bloom, and there were dogwoods, redbuds, bluebells, creeks and birds everywhere. When you drive the winding road through the woods, there's parking sections every so often, most of them empty, but you always see the occasional car or two with someone having their coffee or lunch - no big deal, I was one, too. I respect their solitude. 

I get all the way to the end, by the river, find a cozy spot by myself nestled in some redbuds, and start chowing down. Not two bites in, this creepy, bald, tannish, babyfaced guy in his 60's backs his white truck in right next to me, despite spaces all around, and starts eyeing me. Of course. So I pull out and drive a few dozen yards down to the next empty bank of spots, and try to resume eating. He pulls away after I pull away, and then another two trucks full of guys pull in right on either side of me in my new spot. Same shit. I'm getting pissed off, and my food is getting cold. So once again, I pull out and drive back towards the north end of the woods where I first came in and park there, no one around. Hey! Here comes bald, white-truck guy again. Backs in about three spaces to my left and proceeds to watch me. By this point I try putting my visor down and over and my left hand up to block my face. He pulls away, but slows to a near stop *directly behind my car* and does the blank male gaze stare at me, through my rear view mirror, which *I* return with an expression of consternation. *The fuck*. He drives off, menacingly slow of course, I'm trying to finally finish my food and listen to some music. 

Ok. Beautiful bright red cardinal flies down to the ground right next to my car, so I roll down the passenger side window and am juuuust about to take a pic with my phone....and....bird flies off - because guess who's back. Yep, it's creepy bald white-truck guy. Coming BACK in the opposite direction, slows down again, pulls back in a couple spots away (20 spots open around me). Fed up, I yell through my cracked window, ""MAN, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!""

I'm 52. I'm nothing to look at any more. Even if I was, it PISSES ME OFF why the fuck a woman, any woman, can't sit and have a peaceful meal in the woods and enjoy a tiny speck of nature without being made to feel uncomfortable by suspicious creepers.

I normally ignore red flags in relationships. There haven't been any red flags with him. I've never been so blissfully happy.

A couple of weeks ago we were talking about us and our future and how happy we are, and I said ""I know it's traditional for the guy to ask, but I want you and I want this and I want forever, so will you marry me?""

That didn't stopped me, you just kept walking and I maintained the distance (some 50 feet behind you) pretending to talk on my phone, I thought a couple of times on closing the distance and introduce myself, talk to you, but I didn't, so you kept walking, throuwing glances to check where I was. I could also tell you that once you turned around the corner to the dead end street next to the motorway (the only one near the city centre were parking is not measured) were your car (and mine) was parked that if you had being wearing tennis shoes you would probably have started to run, but wisely you kept you pace in your high heel boots. I stopped by my car, yours was further down the street, and used my phone again, and I saw you taking a picture or video of my when you passed by my side in your car.

What you probably never noticed was the other two guys, the ones in the other sidewalk, the ones that pointed at you and started to follow you before we crossed the first time, you didn't notice how they looked at you or the fact that they seemed to be on drugs, or a bit drunk, or maybe both. You also didn't notice when you passed me in your car that they were in the corner of the dead end street, looking at you in your car passing by and then at me. You also missed the next ten minutes while I waited in my car for the police to arrive (that I called while you were getting into your car), the 15 minutes of questions that followed and me showing them the picture of the two guys that I took while I was following you.

I really sorry that I scared you, but to be completely honest, I was really scared myself, I'm no hero by any means and my instinct was telling me to get the f\*\*\* out of there, but you could have been my wife (she parks in the same street) or my daughter and I wouldn't fogived myself I something happened and I did nothing to stopped it.

Edited to clarify a couple of things:

1 I shared this because the situation scared me, and if a similar situation happened somewhere else I wish that the situation is not ignored or shrugged off. Do I have any advice? Dunno, probably just this: if you think that you are being followed or that something is wrong, don‚Äôt wait to see what happen, call the police, call a friend, a family member, knock on a door or get into a shop, worst case scenario you‚Äôll look a bit paranoid.

2 She was carrying some sort of briefcase alongside her purse and was well dressed, I think that the briefcase was what called those guys attention .

3 They seemed to be waiting for an opportunity, that was the main reason why I didn‚Äôt approached, I was afraid that I would sort of trigger them and offer a second target (still, probably wrong on my side, but in the moment that's what I thought).

4 I called the police because if those guys were trying to assault her, more than likely it wasn‚Äôt the first time and / or they would go for another victim, if it was a mistake worst case scenario they spent 10 mins talking to the police (no idea if they caught them).

5 I parked my car in the dead end street and was walking towards the city centre, she was coming from the city centre, obviously I didn‚Äôt know where she was heading, if instead of turning to the dead end street she had continued walking I would had probably approach her, or she would had reach another street that has more traffic and there are more people walking around.

For the ones wanting to know where this happened:

Final EDIT:

1 For some reason I can't see any new replies from the last 8 or 9 hours, I have seen some of them in the notification's bar in my phone but not all the text is showed and I can't reply from there (and I wanted to reply to some of them) and this is the reason for a final edit.

2 To the people that think this is BS: I whish it was, you don't have to believe me and in fact I don mind, just do yourself a favor and be safe out there (regardless of your gender)

3 I think that someone asked for the police report: REALLY??? Do you expect from me to upload a document with my personal information just so you can ""believe me""?

4 To clarify what happened: I saw the two guys gesturing only a couple of seconds before I crossed the girl and I kept walking a bit trying to decide what to do (turn around?, keep walking?, shout at her?, shout at them?) I deceided to follow her just in case, I didn't know what the guys intentions were (if any) or even if they knew her, but the constant glances at her and finaly the fact that they stayed in the corner (entrance) to the dead end street and the way they looked at her when she passed by in her car was what made me call the police (also, don't forget that I was in that same f\*\*\*\* street and to go back to the city centre I would have had to walk by them).

4.1 Adendum: Northern Ireland is part of te UK, not ROI (Republic Of Ireland) and here we call the police ""the police""

5 Was my decision the best one? most likely not, but it's what I did and no one was hurt (beyond being scared, that is). Now that it passed and reviewing the situation (alongside with some of the comments here) if anything similar happens again I would try to approach the person and explain the situation, or even maybe call the cops straight away.

Did not know it was possible to feel so comfortable working out!,"I got a membership to this gym because it was the closest one to my new apartment, and it happens to be women‚Äôs only. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I actually went, and y‚Äôall, I am BLOWN AWAY.

I am a 4‚Äô11 female powerlifter who competes in the lowest weight class, so I have gotten extremely used to men approaching me to tell me my form is wrong, to lighten the weight, that women who lift don‚Äôt look good, and of course, to hit on me mid-set. I have also always been extremely uncomfortable training glutes because of the stares I am used to receiving from men. Today was a completely different experience.

I loaded up the squat rack without a care in the world, spent extra time doing kickbacks and other butt focused exercises, and no one said anything to me. One woman started laughing when I slammed the dumbbells I was using on the ground with a little too much force, and I started laughing too, when normally something like that would have humiliated me. She ended up approaching me in the locker room to ask me how long I‚Äôve been lifting for and told me that she would love to train with me sometime. No ulterior motive, no intention of trying to get into my pants. Just a nice person wanting to train with a fellow gym rat. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize how impacted I am at the gym by the presence of predatory, know it all men. I don‚Äôt know whether to be thrilled or furious.

1611426899.0,I wonder how much faster appendicitis diagnosed in people who don't have a uterus.,"I went to the ER when I started having symptoms of appendicitis. I was 36 at the time, in full possession of all my faculties, well-spoken, educated, and not in enough pain to derail my composure. I explained to the ER staff that I believed my appendix to be the problem, they took my vitals, blood, and urine and put me on a stretcher-bed in a shared triage room with a bunch of other patients and their companions. This room was way off the beaten path and no nurses or other staff were nearby. The other patients were mostly sleeping since it was very late at night. 

After two hours passed, I walked/shuffled over to the nurses station and asked if I would be seen soon. They didn't seem pressed to make it happen, but about 45 minutes later a female PA came in and interviewed me...about my menstrual cycle and only about my menstrual cycle. I advised her that I have had my cycle since I was 9, am no stranger to cramps, or cysts, or other strange uterine happenings...and this was not my uterus or any other part of my reproductive system. I asked that I be scanned for appendicitis. She *patted my hand* and said I would be seen in the order of priority since the ER was so busy and to hang in there. 

Four more hours passed. I mostly crawled from the stretcher to the nurses station this time. They miraculously found my MRI orders then. They said it'd be 45 minutes until the MRI, then another hour or so until it'd be read. I had to insist that I get the MRI more quickly and that it felt like my body was in real trouble. They had me in the machine 10 minutes later and then put me in a real ER room. The same PA came into my room a mere 10 minutes after that. 

Her exact words were, ""Well, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that you sure do know your body and the bad news is we're keeping you. Your appendix needs to come out right now"".

I replied that neither one of those things qualified to me as 'news' and that I was very disappointed that it took so much self-advocacy to receive a diagnosis. She apologized and I was put on the surgery list.

I was bumped twice on the surgery list. Both times I was bumped for a man, I hope and assume their conditions truly warranted being moved ahead in line, but who knows. 

I finally had my surgery, but I spent 7 hours having to convince medical staff to even examine my appendix...all because I have female reproductive organs that they could blame instead.

Edit 3: This has come up in multiple comments so let's discuss methotrexate! It has multiple uses and is under ridiculous scrutiny post-Roe. The arthritis foundation describes it as **""a well-established FDA-approved therapy with a long track record of safety and effectiveness often used to treat inflammatory arthritis and other autoimmune conditions and, at much higher doses, cancer.""** My husband has been prescribed methotrexate for his psoriasis. His elderly grandmother was prescribed it for her cancer. 

However, it can cause abortions alone with some success up to about 9 weeks and is sometimes used in conjunction with misoprostol for greater success.

So, of course, now pharmacists from all different pharmacies (not just Walgreens) are refusing to fill these prescriptions and some states have actually written methotrexate into their anti-abortion laws.

Two takeaways: 1) women are now having trouble accessing their arthritis medicine because of this and 2) if you need an abortion and have access to methotrexate or of you have access to methotrexate and know someone who needs an abortion, now you know that possibility exists.

1505143373.0,7 University of Rochester profs submit 111-page complaint detailing serial sexual harassment and retaliation for whistleblowing; university president responds by calling them liars,"Seven current and former University of Rochester professors submitted a [111-page complaint](https://www.scribd.com/document/358502273/University-of-Rochester-Eeoc) detailing nearly a decade of serial sexual harassment and bullying on the part of Professor Florian Jaeger, and the retaliation they faced after reporting him. 

The document is long and full of awful behavior. The University promoted Jaeger to full professor WHILE HE WAS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. Here is a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/OutsideOfDog/status/906563977282383873) pointing out some of the highlights (lowlights?). There was also [a Mother Jones piece about the scandal](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/she-was-a-rising-star-at-a-major-university-then-a-lecherous-professor-made-her-life-hell/), but it doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how everything has been mishandled.

University of Rochester president issued [a response likening the complaint to the discredited Rolling Stone UVa piece](http://www.rochester.edu/president/memos/2017/eeoc-filing.html), so basically accusing the complainants of lying. Even though the complainants filed publicly and include detailed references to witness testimony from nearly a dozen victims. And even though the university's own investigation found that Jaeger had sexual relations with current and prospective graduate students that he had power over.

I hope this story gets much more widespread attention. It's a case of an institution choosing to believe the word of one powerful man over the complaints of many less powerful women. 


Edit: Glad to see that this got so many views and so much support! As noted in some of the comments, there's a [change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-rochester-remove-florian-jaeger-and-reevaluate-sexual-harrassment-policy) if you like signing things. The University of Rochester's president Joel Seligman can be reached at seligman@rochester.edu and (585)275-8356.

I also want to point out that a big focus in the complaint is that the University did conduct an investigation, but it was too cursory and seemed more concerned about protecting the University than its students. Thus President Seligman's protests that ""we went through the process"" ignores the complaints that the process is inadequate.

As an example, a student who worked in Jaeger's lab as an undergraduate entered into a sexual relationship with him shortly after she graduated, but while she was still employed by the department and relying on him for letters of recommendation for grad school applications. The University declined to interview her because the relationship happened after she graduated, so it was technically okay - never mind that he wielded great power over her career or could have been grooming her while she worked in his lab as an undergraduate.",TwoXChromosomes

I am a contractor and would lose my job immediately if my employer found out. We want to be parents someday but it‚Äôs not the right time and we have no support from family/ friends. We also both grew up in poverty and swore we would never do that to our future children. 

After a lot of long discussions we decided that, since it‚Äôs so early in the pregnancy, abortion is the best way forward. I did my best to be informed and do my research as to where to go and who to talk to but felt like I was going in circles so I figured my best bet was to talk to my GP and go from there (the closest Planned Parenthood type clinic is two+ hours away). I thought she might be able to provide more information or, at the very least, confirm that I am pregnant.

This is where my asshat of a doctor comes in. I‚Äôve been seeing her for about two years and she is the typical 2 minutes at most with you doctor.

I ended up getting a refund for my co-pay and bawling my eyes out in the parking lot while my husband hugged me. I have been so stressed about this (on top of being exhausted, dealing with morning sickness, and crazy emotional swings) and she made me feel like a despicable human being and utterly worthless. 

I understand that she is allowed to have her own opinions on the matter and has every right to disagree with our choice. However, as a medical professional that I entrust my care to, she does NOT have the right to make shitty comments about that choice and she does not have the right to treat me/us the way she did. (The clinic she works for is not religiously affiliated and does not have any posted information anywhere about being anti-choice.)

My husband and I are both upset and angry but have not, and will not, change our minds on this. I‚Äôll also be finding a new GP as soon as humanly possible.

1569174133.0,‚ÄúShow me your body‚Äù,"So I did something that I‚Äôm really proud of today, and I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to do 6 months ago. I went through a bad breakup a few months back and I‚Äôve been on dating apps.

So I was chatting with this guy who seemed really nice and interesting and was fun to talk to, so we planned to go stargazing tonight. I laid down some ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not about sex on the first date‚Äù ground rules and he was really cool about it. 

Then he said he had been catfished several times and wanted to make sure I was who I am on my profile. I added him on Snapchat and thought that was fine and all. So I sent him just a little regular selfie after my run this a.m. and he was like ‚Äúno I wanna see your whole body. Send me a pic of all of you.‚Äù And I asked why, and he went on a diatribe about how he‚Äôd been on several dates where girls were fatter than they were in their profile pictures, which he called deceptive and catfishing. 

For context, I have had body issues for as long as I can remember, but have been working on myself for the last 6 months or so and am happier with my body than I have been in a while(down 37 pounds!). I think this is the first time I‚Äôve been happy with my appearance.

So I sent him a mirror pic of myself (cause I knew if I didn‚Äôt he would think I was just another ‚Äúcatfisher‚Äù) and waited for him to respond. He did the whole heart eyes thing and a lot of compliments and said he‚Äôd had a lot of ‚Äúcrazy bitches‚Äù deceive him in the past. Then I told him, ‚ÄúI think making someone prove they are skinny/pretty enough to be around you is a shitty and toxic way to treat a person. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been catfished, but I think having to prove my worth via physical appearance alone is a pretty big red flag. Thanks anyway!‚Äù And canceled the date tonight. He wasn‚Äôt very happy about it, but I am. 

I know it doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal, but I‚Äôve had several relationships where someone has made me feel shitty about how I look, and I think I‚Äôm finally learning to value myself as a person. I didn‚Äôt know who else to tell, but it made me happy when I thought about it. Thanks for reading.

Edit: Apparently I should have mentioned this, but I have three full body pics (all from the last two months) in my profile. And when he asked if they were recent I told him which ones were from the last few months and the one that is older.

1591052597.0,From the view of a Police Chief‚Äôs Daughter.,"This has been started and stopped many times in the last couple of days but I feel that everyone who blindly supports ‚ÄúBlue Lives Matter‚Äù should read my story.

My biological father was Police Chief of the small town I was born in.

Instead of growing up to see a person who followed the law, protected his citizens and created peace... I grew up in paralyzing fear.

This man told me day in and day out that I was an Ugly Worthless Bitch. The first time I heard it, I was 8 years old. He‚Äôd later tell me I deserved this since I was a girl. 

This man told me he would shoot the family dog and it would be my fault. (He would later kill strays I brought home to save. 3 animals died this way before I had to stop and realize a stray had a better chance at life without my help). The same dog I was never allowed to feed or care for unless he allowed it. 

This man threatened to bury me and my mother in the backyard of our property because ‚Äúwho would care or find us?‚Äù

This man threw away and/or falsified reports of women who filed for restraining orders. 

This man was openly racist and cruel towards people no matter what. Every racist joke or derogatory quip toward LQBTQ+ would be justified and defended if questioned. 

And an entire fucking police station never once helped. The people who swore to protect and serve, where did they go when my mother and I were hunted down at the domestic violence shelter?

Where were the officers when my father broke my phone when I was 12 and LEFT me with relatives I hardly knew to go on a cross country road trip to stalk and force his ex girlfriend back into a relationship? (I was left in a house for a weekend to sleep on a floor and eat rotten food) 

An entire police force in the town I grew up in never did a god damn thing.

So before you follow the ‚Äúblue lives matter‚Äù remember that our lives didn‚Äôt matter when we were scared and defenseless.

Remember that when you say Blue Lives Matter, you‚Äôre saying no one else has a right to live. 

No, not every cop is bad....But the ones who stay silent are the ones that let this happen.

The officers who remain silent in the face of injustice are just as bad as tyrants like my biological father.

And to those who have never had a bad experience, please count yourself lucky. Don‚Äôt take that for granted.


Also let me really push this message: 

I support the men and women who became officers to fight for the people and serve their community.

I support the protests.
I support the riots.

I do not support the men and women who use this platform to spread hate and fear.

I do NOT support police officers who use their position to ignite the flames of injustice
and abuse the trust of the people.

I do not support my birthplace officers that let countless acts of terror and villainy rage for decades. The system is corrupt. The law was worse through the judges and attorneys my biological father bribed or threatened.

On a side note: I never personally nor will I ever understand the fear of being racially targeted and abused.

I want to use this platform to show that I will no longer be silent if it might help someone in some way.

Edit:

Hey I‚Äôve realized that when I wrote ‚ÄúI support the riots‚Äù , I should‚Äôve been clearer on my meaning and what I was truly trying to say.

I‚Äôm not going to take it out because I won‚Äôt erase that mistake and instead embrace and learn from it.

I want to thank every single one who has commented about it because you‚Äôve helped me learn how to voice what I feel in a better way and I promise I‚Äôll be trying and doing better in the future. 

I appreciate you all for sharing your stories with me. The times are changing and we need to have hope that we can help change it for the better.

My last edit: 

The comments, the support, the stories, everything is overwhelming and I can say without a shadow of a doubt I appreciate every single word.

I even understand the hate i have gotten. This is a sensitive topic for many people. I knew my words would have reactions and I want to let people know that the hateful comments aren‚Äôt necessarily okay, but I understand why you wish to say them.

You want to be heard.
You want to get your message across.

But your message loses meaning when I‚Äôm called a cunt. Or that you wish my home would burn. Or you say that lives don‚Äôt matter.
I get you‚Äôre angry and want a reaction but please be mindful of your words. Even if they may not hurt me, they could have impact on another that reads them.

I accept the criticism and want to learn and be better. I can only hope you do the same. 

We can get through these times together. We can all do our part. I want every person who is on the front lines today to be safe. We are rooting for change for the better.",TwoXChromosomes

I went over to the manager and reported her for saying inappropriate things. The manager was upset by it too and shocked.

I've never had to purchase a Plan B but I'm guessing it's not the most fun thing and then the customer had to be judged by this random cashier. How hard is it to just keep it to yourself?

1622119616.0,My doctor offered to sterilize me and it made me really respect her more.,"I live in Texas and am currently pregnant with my second (planned, very wanted, and last) baby.

We had discussed different birth control options and failure rates at several appointments before. 

She mentioned she hoped that bill wouldn‚Äôt stick around, but told me she could give me a tubal ligation if I wanted it, during my csection. 

She didn‚Äôt ask to speak to my husband. She didn‚Äôt try and talk me out of it (she offered it before I even brought it up.) She didn‚Äôt insist I would want more kids or I was too young.

1531257040.0,Ectopic pregnancy leads to abortion shaming...,"Two weeks ago I landed in the emergency room. I thought my appendix may be bursting, I was in easily the worst pain of my life. My blood work revealed I was in the very early stages of pregnancy and it seemed to be an ectopic pregnancy, where the egg is fertilized in the fallopian tube. The cells were growing in the tube, which was what was causing the pain. These are unviable pregnancies, there is no chance the baby can survive. After I heard my options I said I wanted an injection that would terminate the pregnancy. I couldn't believe all the raised eyebrows. I was asked by multiple doctors if I was sure, if I wanted time to think about it, if I wanted to talk it over with my husband. My OB works at the hospital and came to see me, (she delivered my daughter 19 months ago). She said "" We both know your body is perfectly capable of producing beautiful, healthy babies"", so she thought we should wait. She also told me that if I got the injection and it didn't work, the baby would certainly have defects and I would have to have a surgical abortion under medical law. I was shocked.

1. This is not a baby, it's a cluster of cells that cannot possibly grow into a baby located in a place in the body that IS NOT FOR GROWING BABIES.
2. Ectopic pregnancy can lead to the fallopian tube rupturing which can be fatal. It is extremely dangerous.
3. I felt like I was being stabbed to death, even morphine was not touching the pain. My blood pressure was sky high and I was doubled over.
4. Am I a walking miracle? Am I going to be the first woman in history to have an ectopic pregnancy that leads to a healthy child? That's what we are putting our money on?

I wanted to share this experience because it left me flabbergasted and more than a little angry. This was a case when abortion is medically necessary to save the life of the mother, IF you can even call it an abortion at all. Suddenly there was a hard choice to be made and guilt and shame that needed to be felt? Fuck. That. Noise.

EDIT: Thank you guys for being so supportive and kind! I want to clear up a few questions. I was in the ER twice, the first time they told me I was pregnant, and I was presenting as ectopic (abdominal pain, severe vaginal bleeding), however they could not see the pregnancy in the fallopian tube or in the uterus. A doctor told me I should have an injection to terminate a possible ectopic pregnancy, I said that was what I wanted. A different doctor came to see me and told me since they could not see anything on the ultrasound I should go home and wait. They gave me pain meds and a strainer to check my urine in case I was possibly passing a kidney stone. I was told to come back if the pain worsened or I had any vomiting or fever.

Two days later I started vomiting uncontrollably and the pain was still there (even with the oxycodone) so I went back to the ER. A second ultrasound showed the pregnancy in the fallopian tube. Yet another doctor was horrified when I explained what happened on my first visit and laughed out loud when I mentioned the kidney stone theory, she said ""If it looks like an ectopic pregnancy and presents like an ectopic pregnancy, we should treat it like an ectopic pregnancy."" She was concerned enough to call me at home the next day to see how I was doing and provided her personal cell if I had any questions or complications.

My takeaway from this is that when these things happen, you have to be your own biggest advocate. Listen to your body and trust yourself, don't be afraid to disagree with a doctor, and please don't let someone shame or convince you into not doing what is best for you.",TwoXChromosomes

1676640168.0,I went to a Texas ER yesterday. It was bad.,"tl;dr - Title

Yesterday I went to a Dallas, TX ER. About ten minutes after I woke up that morning I collapsed as sudden, sharp, pain started spreading from my lower left abdomen. It was *excruciating*. I have a very high pain tolerance, and I couldn't speak, or stand up, or walk. All I could do was writhe and cry and vomit in agony. I've had an ovarian torsion that required surgery before, as well as several instances of ruptured ovarian cysts that caused full-on internal bleeding. This felt like that.

My husband called 911 for an ambulance, as he did not believe he could get me safely to the car and drive with me in that condition.

The EMTs wouldn't even look at me and clearly didn't want to take me to the hospital. You see - we just moved, and the neighborhood is poor. I have 'locked hair, piercings, and tattoos and I wasn't obviously gushing blood from something like a gunshot wound. They quite clearly assumed I was faking and drug-seeking.

And the rest of the day got no better.

These medical professionals let me writhe in agony for well over an hour while they grilled me about whether I was pregnant or not, over and over. Ironically - I'd actually really love to have another baby, but I had to be surgical sterilized (cauterized tubes) for my own safety over a decade ago. AND I haven't had sex in six months, which my husband confirmed for them at my bedside. None of those facts, or that trauma mattered to them. They angrily demanded that I *stand up* and go do their piss-test. I had to remind them, nearly screaming, that I couldn't stand up or walk and they begrudgingly and resentfully got me a bedpan.

All my blood and urine work came back clean because *of course it did*. I am not pregnant, and I wasn't on any illicit substances.

They did finally, at this point, provide a small amount of pain relief.

They did an ultrasound. They CT'd my abdomen.

And much later an exasperated male doctor comes back to tell me I have a UTI. I know my body - this was *not* solely a UTI. I said as much, and restated my history.

Friends, I shit you not, this is what he said to me (pissily):

""Well, *yes*, we found ruptured hemorrhagic cysts on your ovaries. And *I guess maybe* that could've caused your pain. I don't know. But there's no way to be sure. There's nothing we can do for you - we're discharging you.""

As you might imagine - I have concerns at this point. I've been through this before, and both the internal bleeding and the recovery pain are things I wanted clearly addressed by the staff before I left.

Despite my pain and the medication, I was calm and very polite as I tried to ask my questions. The doctor just walked away. And when I tried to ask my nurse she literally wouldn't stop interrupting me to talk over me. When my husband asked her why she wouldn't let me speak, she literally threw up her hands and said she wasn't going to talk to us anymore and walked out. I was discharged, and I needed to *fucking leave*.

When my husband asked for a Patient Advocate, no one would acknowledge the request or even look at him. We didn't get a patient advocate, despite asking multiple times.

There was nothing to do but leave. Despite my medical history, proof of currently rupturing cysts on my ovaries, and clean drug tests - they still treated me like an addict using them to get high. And the second I wasn't pregnant, they didn't give a single flying fuck. I was a living incubator, or a drug addict, or both. And they didn't let me be anything else - I couldn't just be a person in crisis who needed help.

They didn't even note the ruptured cysts they found on my discharge paperwork - just the UTI.

I don't want to hear excuses about the pandemic or worker burnout. It simply *isn't* an excuse. If you can't do your job without punching down on sick people *it's on you to find a new job*. Period.

The woman who personally performed my ultrasound, and the gentleman who directly performed my CT were both kind, empathetic people who obviously did their best. Being decent is clearly still possible.

No one else chose to be decent yesterday at DALLAS REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.

I would tell you all to please be safe, but I don't really know how that's possible all things considered. Be aware, if nothing else, of how little you matter to these people.

Edited to add: We have insurance, so that certainly wasn't the issue here.

It has some connections to my Uni and nearby Unis, which are also skewed towards women, and the nature of the games involved are more popular with women so naturally our group skews women.

The Facebook group has its own discord server which we use for voice chat in gaming sessions. I saw a post asking if anyone wants to join a scribble session (drawing game where people guess what you draw) with a link to the discord voice channel. Only 7 people showed up (there were some others but they left quickly). Me, 5 other girls and 1 guy.

I actually didn't know anyone at all since I'm not that active, but I had a very fun time chatting with these people. What I noticed halfway through is that the way we treated each other was the exact same way we treated the sole guy in the group. No one harassed him, asked him for nudes, hit on him, aggressively asked him for his instagram/snapchat, or otherwise made him feel uncomfortable. Likewise he didn't harass anyone either. We just played the game normally and had lots of laughs, drawing funny sketches and making terrible guesses at what other people drew. BTW this is not one of the regular games in the group; it was just a quick and easy to set up game for people who are bored in that moment.

This is the only session I've been in, even though I've been in the server/group for a few months now. I've searched through chat logs and Facebook posts and I've found pretty much zero posts complaining about being harassed (male or female) or otherwise made to feel uncomfortable. And we have thousands of people in the group. No one knows each other IRL, and we have people from all around the world, although most are from the US, and people from all sorts of ages.

Now compare this to experiences of female gamers in male-dominated gaming spaces, who are often harassed and bullied and ultimately made to feel very uncomfortable and even unsafe. I just wish that some male gamers, just like female gamers, could treat other people like normal beings and not suddenly change their mood just because someone with an opposite-sex-sounding voice joins the server. I applaud both male and female gamers who consistently respect other people in game already.",TwoXChromosomes
1573175015.0,A Friendly Reminder: You don't break your hymen when you lose your virginity,"In light of the recent gross nonsense around rapper TI insisting that a doctor check his daughter's hymen annually, I thought it was a good time to remind people of these two important videos regarding what hymens actually are and how they work:

**The virginity fraud TED Talk by Nina D√∏lvik Brochmann and Ellen St√∏kken Dahl**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oNlTrLIjU4

**A history of hymens with Dr. Jen Gunter**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa3MnKV1CKI



If you can't watch these right now here's your TLDW:

* Hymens are only there to keep irritants out of the infant vagina. After age three they naturally start to open up and/or break apart because their job is done.

* Adult and teen hymens aren't solid barriers; you can't ""break"" them.

* Hymens can easily stretch around objects (such as penises) without sustaining any damage.

* Many women still have an ""intact"" hymen after they have had sex, even if it's been multiple times. In a study of pregnant teens, only 2 out of 36 girls showed clear signs of penetration. 

* Hymens can be damaged as a result of other non-sex activities, including exercise.

* Hymens don't bleed much when damaged, as they have few blood vessels in them.

* The majority of women do not experience pain or bleeding the first time they have sex, and if they do it may not be related to the hymen at all. Bleeding is a common result of sex that is too rough or not lubricated enough, which is extremely common in couples who are inexperienced. Variations in an individual woman's anatomy can also lead to bleeding even with otherwise well-lubricated and gentle sex.

That's my public service announcement. I hope you and your hymen have a happy day.

EDIT: Some users pointed out that my final point (originally from Dr. Gunter's talk) can come off as judgemental, so I re-phrased it.",TwoXChromosomes

1607953266.0,Cousin‚Äôs husband smacked my ass as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù. Where‚Äôs the joke? And why am I made to feel guilty about being upset about it?,"I‚Äôm looking for a little bit of advice or support here... I‚Äôve never dealt with something quite like this before! It‚Äôs so outrageous that women have to go through harassment and then, on top of that, are made to feel as if they‚Äôre at fault! 

My cousin (29F), who I‚Äôve been close with for my entire life, has a husband (30ishM) whose manners I (24F) would describe as .... well... uncivilized to say the least. To get to the point, we were all in the kitchen (my cousin, her husband, and I. My boyfriend wasn‚Äôt with us at the time) at our grandmothers house. I was washing the dishes, and my cousin was sitting across the room. Her husband is standing next to me. All of a sudden, this fucking guy slaps my ass. I‚Äôm talking full ass smack, with the palm of his hand. 
 
I simply froze. I was absolutely horrified, mortified, humiliated, embarrassed, and so, so, SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I wanted to cry. I managed to sputter out something to the effect of ‚ÄúWHY DID YOU JUST DO THAT? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!‚Äù To which their response was.... complete surprise and bewilderment. They were genuinely taken aback at the fact that I reacted the way I did. They both immediately went into defensive mode, saying that it was just a joke‚Äî didn‚Äôt I see that my cousin was right there, and it can‚Äôt have been in a sexual way? It was just a joke! It was supposed to be funny! All their friends do stuff like this all the time and they think it‚Äôs funny!

Obviously, I disagree. I was so shocked, I don‚Äôt even remember exactly what I said, but I made it clear that I was angry, uncomfortable, and this was highly inappropriate. They said they were sorry, but they also really made me feel kind of stupid for being so uncomfortable, like as if I‚Äôm some kind of prude who just has no sense of humour. 
Am I crazy? In my eyes, it‚Äôs so beyond unacceptable to smack a woman‚Äôs ass like that (unless you have the kind of relationship that permits that, obviously!). I don‚Äôt understand how they could BOTH have seen this as a funny joke. How could I not be mad about this? I felt really violated ‚Äî this is MY body and you have 0 right to it, and I don‚Äôt care if you thought it would be a ‚Äújoke‚Äù! 

I told my boyfriend about it today because... well, I wanted to! And of course he reacted by being really angry at this guy for having the nerve to do that. My boyfriend feels, as I do, that this was a gesture of blatant disrespect and I don‚Äôt want to have anything to do with my cousins husband anymore, nor does my boyfriend. 
Well, my boyfriend messaged the husband because he was (and is) really angry about this. My cousin sent me back the screenshot of my boyfriends text saying this to me :‚Äúyou‚Äôve done a great job üëèüëèüëè for what was meant as an innocent joke. We understood you got mad and both apologized. Had no idea things would end up like this. And there was no single ounce of disrespect. But gee, this is great. Guess I needed a good cry for today.‚Äù

They‚Äôre kind of making me feel like I‚Äôm blowing things out of proportion and ruining my relationship with my cousin and her husband for nothing. 
Am I crazy? It‚Äôs reasonable for me to not want to associate with my cousins husband, isn‚Äôt it? And now, her response to me is making me seriously reconsider my relationship with her, even though I really do love her amd care about her a lot. I‚Äôm still really hurt, though.

edit:

Thank you so much for all the kind comments. It‚Äôs nice to feel supported by all of you guys online! I have had a couple of family members tell me that I am being unreasonable which is a bit upsetting. However, I‚Äôve been really uplifted and validated by all of your nice messages!

I've set my affairs in order, taken leave from my job and I am not afraid to make any sacrifice necessary to defend my family, my community, and future generations. 

It's the only way I can look my daughter in the eye and tell her that I will do whatever it takes to protect her rights.

When the people withdraw their consent and cooperation from their government in sufficient numbers, no government can rule. We have the intrinsic power to become ungovernable and nonviolently compel compliance with our demand.

I'm working as part of a team with the newly formed civil resistance movement Whatever It Takes (WIT). You can sign up by sending us an email to WIT2022@protonmail.com

We are so overwhelmed  by the outpouring of support, and also the constructive criticism.

First I want to say that these incredibly stressful times and increasingly dangerous times for all of us- there are no more safe options. It is the conviction of those of us at WIT that inaction is the most dangerous choice of all.

We are looking for people with experience in organization/activism, social media/PR, and web design.  We are taking steps to increase the security of our sign up process and are willing to set up one on one signal calls to discuss our mission in depth.

1536766473.0,"How Birth Control Pills Gave Me My Childhood Back, And How A Pharmacist Tech Threatened That By Making Assumptions","I will admit this happened awhile ago *- maybe two and a half or three years ago -* but I still get extremely mad when I think about it or tell the story to someone. So, here I am to rant and rave and hopefully impart the wisdom of speaking up for oneself to a teenager that may need it.

I got my first bloody welcoming into puberty at ten (while riding a horse, to make matters worse!) and for those first few years, things were relatively painless. Of course it was too good to last and, come my first foray into middle school, disaster struck.

What had once been a mildly uncomfortable inconvenience became something that left me crying and bedridden for weeks at a time. Turns out six years later: nothing was considered terribly wrong with my body. In fact, all my baby making bits are in working order as of this post. But my body failed terribly at the whole menstrual business.

So I would bleed for months at a time (usually heavily with extreme clotting) with such intense pain that I could barely get out of bed, let alone go to school or have a social life beyond my phone and computer. It would leave my sobbing and light headed and ungodly sick. Then, for a few glorious months, I wouldn't bleed one bit. The cycle of this repeated regularly as my mother took my to the gyno and I was tested and questioned until they just prescribed birth control.

It changed my life in ways I cannot describe.

That tiny little pill offered me my freedom and childhood back. I could go to school, I could hang out with my friends. I was not longer burning through super pads and tampons within two hours. Everything became a million times better.

At fourteen and fifteen I began picking up my monthly pack on my own when my mother was too busy. I had never had an issue. None of the clerk's had ever batted an eye as they got my bag together and checked me out. Just my name, birthday, and a signature to get my blessed ticket to comfortable living.

Until one month, when I was sixteen, and I ran into the Walmart Pharmacy to get my packet while my mother waited in the car. It shouldn't have been more than seven minutes with a line, maybe five without one. We'd done this countless times by then.

So I went in, waited for the two people before me to finish up, and got to the counter. Before me stands a short, older woman. I told her I'm there for my birth control and gave her my name. She asked for my birthday, eyes scanning over me. I remember trying to ignore the judging stare.

""How old are you?"" She asked after a long pause following my giving her my birth year, not once, but twice.

""I'm sixteen.""

""That's too young. I'm not going to give this to you. You'll have to have a parent come in.""

I was shell shocked and confused. I didn't know the laws like I do now, or else I'd have made a scene, and I wish so badly I had asked to speak to somebody else that could've save me this hassle.

""I pick up from here every month,"" I said and prayed I didn't sound like some meek kid, wishing desperately that she would give me my medicine as a line was forming by that point and my social anxiety was skyrocketing. ""Nobody ever said I needed a parent. It's prescribed for me, not my mother.""

""Well you'll have to have her come in regardless. Sorry.""

I left the pharmacy and fast walked out of the front doors trying to will away tears or embarrassment and a million other emotions I still cannot name to this day. Thankfully, as mentioned, my mother was in the car.

I told her what had happened and she told me to stay in the car while she ran in. She told me that she gave the woman an earful. I ended up with my pills that month.

But the thing is, there wasn't anything policy or legality wise to prevent me from getting my medicine. It was the woman's own beliefs.

She didn't see a teenager that had missed out on several years of her childhood. She didn't see the immense pain I would be in without the medication. She didn't know I would bleed for the next several months, or that I'd be so lightheaded I would feel dizzy and almost blackout just getting out of bed, or that I'd be crying out and sobbing from the pain that nothing could help, or that I'd fall behind in school so badly (I actually failed a school year because of this issue) it would take weeks to make up. She didn't have a single idea what the pill provided for me.

She only saw a teenager that *must* be using the pill for pregnancy prevention. 

And the thing is: both of those girls would have deserved their right to the pill just the same.

Thank you for listening to my rant. Please, all pill taking people: know the laws and policies of your area so you won't doubt yourself like I did and possibly be in a worse situation. I've learned them since (found them out after this incident) and keep updated as best I can.

About 80 years ago, after my grandmother had given birth to her 9th child, the doctor told her if she got pregnant again, the childbirth would kill her. She went to her parish (Catholic) priest and asked for permission to use the rhythm method (the most benign and ineffective form of contraception), but the priest denied her permission, saying that she had to be \*faithful\* to her husband (meaning submission to my grandfather's sexual desires, i guess). Of course she wound up getting pregnant. 

One day a friend came over and asked her why she was cleaning her windows when she was 7 months pregnant. She responded that she was cleaning them for her wake. And after she died a few months later during childbirth, she was displayed in her casket in her house, which had nice clean windows. This detail kills me and keeps me up at night; i dont know much about my grandmother's life except that it ended with her facing an unnecessary death forced on her by her priest, and she was worried about the fucking windows being dirty.

This story was told to me pretty matter of factly, with a little bitterness. But it seems like most of my extended family is still pretty devout catholics, and no one ever told me exactly why she died from childbirth.

It is maybe a 15 minute drive and it was the middle of the day and a busy, normal part of town. 

I am used to catcalling and creepy and disgusting men, sadly that's life. But I would never have expected how much worse and scarier it would get if I - a reasonably young, reasonably attractive woman - appeared to be disabled and in a wheelchair. Before, I would have thought that this would make me less attractive to creepy people. It was the opposite. The number of creepy, disgusting, sexual comments and propositions I got from men of all ages on that short drive was horrible. Some even tried to touch/push the wheelchair I was sitting in, some stood in my way on purpose and wouldn't move so I had to dangerously maneuver around them to get away.

Owner let him stay on premises until the guy managed to REALLY piss off our KJ by informing him that his dog MIGHT chew the wires for the sound board unless KJ supervised this damn dog that wasn't even his. KJ said ""yeah fuck you bro"" and the guy started some shit with KJ and hassled other customers and the owner apparently went ahead and tossed the dude out in accordance with his obviously crappy tendencies. Owner never tells someone to just GTFO and prefers to solve disagreements and keep everyone welcome.  Well last night he emphatically 86'd someone finally.  When I came in later he was very apologetic to me for my experience and I said ""no worries, I know none of us knew the dude it's all good, thanks for getting him outta here for everyone's sake."" And life went on and we all had a good time. Long live my favorite place to drink and bullshit!

1522560573.0,I did the reddit thing today! Saved a young girl from a creep.,"So I was at the swimwear section at walmart, looking for a last minute swimsuit, and there's a group of 3 very young girls next to me. Suddenly two of them leave to check out other things and it's just me and this other one, let's call her tall girl. So I overhear a conversation between Tall Girl and a strange man (must've been mid 30s) and it goes like this:

- creepy guy: babble babble, ""I was wondering if you'd like to go out sometime""

tall girl: ehh, no thank you (nervous giggle)

-creepy guy: C'mon, do you think i'm that ugly? gimme a chance....more babble


at this point I remember something someone on reddit did, and I ask her, ""Hey, did you find the two piece you were looking for, are you ready to go try it on? let's go""

she's a bit confused for a second, but she's like oh yeah i'm ready to go, and she walks away with me.

We move up to the dressing room area and she says ""Thank you sooo much, that was so weird, i'm only sixteen y'know""

Then her friends join us and they're thanking me and i think they might have said something to the guy because he comes back quickly and says ""I'm sorry i didnt know you were 16""

Like it wasn't enough that she said no thank you, no you had to make sure she was underage to leave her alone.

I felt so nervous but really good afterwards! Thanks random woman on reddit who pulled this at the gym and made a post the other day! :)


edit: for the people sending me PMs,  I don't think there's anything wrong with a guy asking a girl out, albeit this wasn't the best scenario, she was clearly a very YOUNG girl  and he was clearly past his 30s. ",TwoXChromosomes

I(F 24) have 3 roommates (All M 25). One of them has a girl who is his booty call. She's been coming over a couple times a week for the last 2 months, but I don't even know her name. 

Apparently she complained to my roommate that I never have clothes on when I'm in the community spaces (living room, kitchen, ect.). Since I've been working from home since all this pandemic stuff started, I usually walk around in my silk robe or a longer night shirt. I've always done this, and it's never been an issue as my roommates and I are good friends and very comfortable around each other. 

I just dont understand how this girl thinks she can come into MY home, refuse to even introduce herself, and then start commenting on how I dress, in my own home. The audacity.


Edit: I know my roommate is violating social distancing. He is aware, I've talked with him at length about why he needs to stay home. He understands and is making an effort but noone is perfect. In response, myself and other two roommates are not leaving the house at all. We're disinfecting like crazy to make sure we dont spread anything. Please be aware that I am doing all that I can to keep him in, but at the end of the day I cannot force him to do anything.

Edit 2.0: I call the girl his bootycall because that is the ONLY way my roommate has referred to her. If they're more than that, he hasn't shared that with us for whatever reason. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1623181425.0,The UPS Man,"So, 21 years ago, I decided to take a couples swing dance class alone. I was 17years old, shy and awkward. I was paired with a man in his early thirtyi-ish named Kevin. I was terrified, a sexual assault survivor, and an adult man touching me, lifting me in the air, and sliding me between his legs backwards (swing dancing is wild when you type it lol), and I was so scared. I was trying to find my adult legs, and face my fears I had an amazing boyfriend, but adult men scared the beans out of me.  This lovely, lanky, goofy man could not have been more appropriate, more kind, and more healing to me.
A little over ten years later, I moved back to my hometown, and started working at the local coffee shop. I was pregnant with my first baby. The UPS guy came in on my first day of work, and here was Kevin! Still as kind, as disarmingly cheerful. We recognized each other and took a swing around the shop. Now I have three kids, and he is the UPS driver on my home route. Every time I see him I smile. I saw him yesterday as he dropped off packages and gave our dogs cookies and it got me thinking. 

I think it's so important to recognize how healing good interactions with kind men can be to young girls. This is why the narrative of ""don't put yourself in scary situations"" is so bad. We, as girls, should be able to expect this sort of interaction. Yet, I remember him because it was such a rare and treasured memory of an adult man NOT being a creep. How sad, that simply being a good human is so remarkable.",TwoXChromosomes

You took the whiskey and scanned it, but before handing it back you crouched down a bit so you could look her in the eyes and asked, ‚ÄúIs everything all right?

You laughed with her and said, ‚ÄúOh good: I just wanted to make sure. Her face was brighter as she left. 

I thought it was so conscientious that, instead of assuming everything was fine and standing by and saying nothing, you recognized the potential of something more serious in an everyday situation and took initiative to look into it.

1508130414.0,To the woman at the gas station,"Thank you. It was 11:45 tonight, a Sunday, and the roads were pretty deserted. Me, being the procrastinator that I am, was on my last bit of gas and HAD to stop to make it home. I pulled into the nearest gas station and it was closed, but not a big deal as I had my debit card. I scanned the station and saw you pumping gas and immediately felt better as there was someone else with me at the empty and dimly lit station.

I got out, glanced around, being aware of my surroundings as my always paranoid mother taught me. We made eye contact and you gave me a comforting smile. I was typing in my pin number and noticed you closing your gas cap and getting into your vehicle. I didn't want you to leave. You were a stranger, you could have been a serial killer, but your smile and your eyes put me at ease. I felt safer with you around. 

You pulled away and went around the gas station and the minute you were out of sight, I was on alert. I kept checking my surroundings, wishing I hadn't picked the seeimingly slowest pump at this station. 

He came put of no where-- I was alone and then I wasn't. He wore camo pants and an oversized black hoodie, the hood up and shielding a lot of his face. I gripped my keys tightly in my hand, trying to get them between my fingers just in case. He asked for a ride, calling me ""sugar titties"" and winking. I quickly said, ""sorry, I have somewhere to be"" and wished I had sounded more confident as the words left my mouth. He persisted, yanking on the door handle of my passenger back door. I said ""no!"" again, this time, more forcefully. He kept laughing, like this was the most hilarious game in the world and tried my passenger door.

I froze. I'm not proud of myself. I should have jumped into the car and drove off. I should have had my cell phone in my hand instead of my car. I should have gotten gas that morning instead of the last minute. In everyday life, I'm typically a force to be reckoned with and strong and painfully independent. Why did I freeze? Why didn't I jump into action? Why did I act like a sitting duck instead of a ferocious lion? 

And then you came. You rolled up next to us in that boxy Element car that I used to complain about to anyone who would listen and you just rolled down your window, your phone in one hand, illuminating your face in the darkness. 

""I have 911 on the line. Take your chances or keep walking.""

He immediately put his hands up, shaking his head. A slew of curse words were said, including crazy bitch and he backed away. My eyes left him and moved to you. You simply nodded and drove away, not actually pulling out onto the street until you saw that I was safely in my car.

To the lady at the gas station,

Thank you. Thank you for being kind, for being strong, and for caring about a complete stranger that needed help. I can only hope that if I'm ever in such a situation again, I have the same strength and confidence you have. The world could use more people like you.",TwoXChromosomes

My partner texted me after leaving that she was in a bad mood and he didn't know why. Came out later in the afternoon that an older woman had started yelling at her while she was packing her bag that she was in the wrong room and she needed to get out.

It shouldn't matter, but just so you understand just how fucked it was - she's cisgender, has developed physically somewhat, but she is skinny, tends to dress somewhat neutrally (although she was actually wearing a skirt today). The one truly ""out of place"" marker is that she has a pixie cut that she's had for years now... she has thin, curly hair and discovered a while ago that she likes her hair short. There was nothing but this haircut to mark her as out of place. That's how bad the anti-trans virus has gotten ... short hair cuts on visibly preteen kids are enough to start harassing them.

I hate that it's gotten to this. I have been more silent than I should have been.

1) This little anecdote was part of a whole conversation. 20 minutes may not seem long but it was long enough to hear several concerning statements outside of his abortion opinions. I didn‚Äôt jump to any conclusions, he led me down the rabbit hole. He also claims to be atheist so I‚Äôm not sure how he got so sucked into Trumpism. 

2) Speaking of abortion rights, I do not agree with his stance. I believe in unrestricted access to abortion for many reasons. I highly encourage to watch this video by Mama Doctor Jones who gives a thorough review on why banning or restricting abortions is not only unethical but has lasting impact on the woman, her future, her children, and her community.[Doctor Explains Roe V Wade](https://youtu.be/rHrxSUgLvvA)

3) For those saying I was ruining relationships with politics or bringing politics where it doesn‚Äôt need to be, screw you. It must be nice to live in a world where actual government policies don‚Äôt affect you. I work in healthcare and government needs to stay out of my job. What happens with someone‚Äôs body is their and only their decision.

Source 5 is the appeal)

The woman who was allegedly raped by a group of men in Ayia Napa, Cyprus warns visitors from visiting the place as she prepares to appeal her conviction in a new interview. Cyprus has long struggled with human trafficking and rape cases, and has one of Europe's lowest conviction rates for rape.

For those new to the case:The British woman (18 at the time) was having consensual sex with one man, while another one secretly filmed her without her consent. Then, his friends broke in, pinned the girl down and allegedly raped her. The men claim it was consensual. She claims that up to 12 of them raped her, however, you can't expect a gang rape victim to remember the exact number of her attackers. DNA evidence and footage linked 7 of them to the crime scene, not 12.

\- She withdrew her accusation after being interrogated for eight hours without access to a translator or lawyer. She claims the police intimidated her into withdrawing her accusation, but the officers deny this. Why can't we verify anyone's claim? Because the cops didn't record the interrogation nor did they take notes about what she was saying. She was then thrown in jail for a month and had her passport confiscated,

\- The men, who were referred to as ""good lads"" by their parents, were released, went home, chanted ""The Brit is a whore"" when landing in their home country, and then released revenge porn of the girl to the media. You know, prime ""good lad"" behavior. **Important note: None of the videos shows her having consensual sex with multiple men. The video 4chan has been circulating is fake.** It's taken from a random porn site and isn't even shot in the same hotel room. If you jumped to conclusion and assumed she is guilty over that fake video, you need to use this moment for some self-reflection. The real videos merely show her having consensual sex with one guy. In other words, the real videos are from before his friends broke in. The Cypriot media also **falsely** claimed that she had made rape accusations in the past and that she was a stripper.

\- She was charged with ""public mischief"", but wasn't allowed to present evidence of her rape. The judge argued that it wasn't a rape trial. Thing is, how is she supposed to prove that she didn't lie when she isn't allowed to present evidence of her rape? Some of the evidence the judge didn't allow was the 35 bruises and scratches on her body, especially around her groin and buttocks, and a bloodied condom with the men's DNA which the incompetent police had missed. The judge, Michalis Papanasthasiou, insisted that all the bruises were the work of a jellyfish, despite the doctors telling him that he was wrong. The government's medical examiner meanwhile barely found any scratches because he didn't check her entire body and ""forgot"" to add basic information like height and weight in his half-page report.

No matter who's story you believe, you can't deny that the way the Cypriot police and judicial system has handled this case has been a massive joke. Even the UK foreign office, which normally stays silent on such cases, has called it ""problematic"".

Nor can you deny that it isn't normal, ""Good boy"" behavior to film a woman without her consent and then release the footage like a creep.

Whatever the case might be, the girl's warning isn't extreme: Cyprus has, as mentioned, a ridiculously low conviction rate for rape exactly because of this type of incompetence by the police and judicial system.

PS! The names of the Israel i men were released by the court documents. Even if you think they weren't rapists, it cannot be denied that they videotaped and then circulated video footage of a girl without her consent, which in any civilized country is a serious crime.

1673987775.0,Just RAN out of a lunch date,"The man ranted for like five minutes about how much he didn't want girl children and saw them as punishment. He said ""if my wife put out three girls in a row, I'd cheat til I got a boy"". 

(I explained that it was actually the man's material contribution to pregnancy that determines sex, but why did I bother? He was clearly dumb.) 

Oh he said ""I don't believe in gender roles but there's just so many things I don't think women are physiologically capable of."" in reference to me discussing painting houses with my dad. Painting houses y'all. 

He then went off about how our city was being ""taken over by alphabet people"". In response I played dumb and asked him what alphabet people were. He said ""Think about the alphabet. Who describes themselves with letters?"". I said, ""Like Sesame Street? The Muppets?"". He rolled his eyes and said I needed to get out in the world more (I'd just told him I moved back here after living various places and travelling for ten years. I mentioned I'd lived in five cities, been to 30 states and 15 countries.) he also said I should ""touch grass"". 

He opened a weed vape in front of me and went off to the bathroom to hit it. So I grabbed my coat and things and ran right out the door. Luckily we'd only communicated through the app we met on, so he has no way to contact me or my full name. 

He is 35. What a waste of an hour. 

But I will say I'm proud of myself. When I was younger I would just sit through the whole date in fear and play nice and pretend that I was having a great time so he wouldn't get mad at me. But I literally spent most of this one thinking ""how do I leave NOW?"" and took the first chance I got.

Edit: 

1. Met on an app. Had many text convos before planning this lunch. He was polite, smart, and interesting. His profile said ""liberal"". 

2. This was all kind of word vomited out pretty quickly. The first half hour or so was more casual chit chat, but once he got on this subject all the crazy came out. 

3. I didn't leave immediately because I didn't want him following me out! He pretty much had just said ""I hate women."" I wasn't going to run the risk he would prove it via violence. You don't even need a license for a gun in my state. I was being cautious.

4. Alphabet people is how some people do the wink and nudge to let you know they don't like LGBTQ+ people. The first time I heard it used was in a Dave Chappell bit. And the second time was today. I know he meant this because even though I played dumb, he then made his comment about this city turning into San Fransisco. I said ""The rent here isn't that high."" even though I know what he meant because of how associated my city is with gay culture. This is when he rolled his eyes, said he needed weed, and went to the bathroom. I made my graceful exit immediately after he was out of my eyeline.

Edit: 

Atlanta is pretty progressive generally, especially in this part of it. The app only lets you choose liberal, conservative, moderate, or other.

1580531573.0,I'm so tired,"I'm so sick of the everyday sexism. I'm exhausted.

I'm a physician, and I get bullshit for being a female literally every day. I typically have a good sense for benign bias from well-meaning patients and colleagues versus malignant, angry sexism, and I navigate those scenarios accordingly. That alone takes some effort, but it's become second nature, so whatever. I'm used to being called ""nurse"" or ""ma'am"" or ""miss"" or ""lady"" by patients. I've described, in detail, a surgery I am JUST ABOUT TO PERFORM, and had the patient afterwards ask when they can speak to a doctor. I've had a patient call me ""sweetheart"" while I was sticking a needle into him. I've come to assess a very sick ICU patient and had an old female nurse declare ""the little lady is here!"". I've fought very public fights with sexist superiors and become better and stronger for it. I'm known as vocally opinionated and ""sassy"", and that's fine, I definitely am. I normally try to wear that proudly.

This pediatric month, I'm working with a colleague of my training level who is way less experienced in our current content but still CONSTANTLY interrupts me when I'm talking to staff and patients during MY procedures, and I've chalked it up to social unawareness. Today, I enter a room to do a procedure and introduce myself as ""Dr. MrsRodgers"" to the patient's dad. I go to shake the patient's father's hand, and he physically recoils, takes 2 steps back, and says, ""Oh, oh, I can't shake your hand, sorry, it's religous"". I was confused, but whatever, fine, roll with it. I start explaining the procedure I am about to perform on his child, and my colleague barrels in. He interrupts me immediately, stating, ""Hi, I'm Dr. Colleague, I work with \*MY FIRST NAME\*"", and walks up to shake the dad's hand. The dad immediately extends his hand and engages in a handshake.

I was fucking crushed. I felt so dehumanized. Watching my patient's father shake my less experienced male colleague's hand, the male colleague who had just introduced himself as Dr. Colleague while stripping me of my title and casually referring to me as my first name, after that father had just recoiled from my handshake... In that moment, I realized it never ends. This fight never ends. It doesn't matter what I do, what degrees I earn, how hard I work, how smart or compassionate or accomplished I ever am or ever will be. I will always be second class. I will always be interrupted by male colleagues. I will always deal with sexist ""jokes"" from old male attendings. I will always be called nurse at best, sexually harassed at worst by patients. People will always look to my younger male trainees and assume they're in charge. It never ends. I am so fucking tired of fighting this fight and I am so, so sad that everything I've worked my entire life for is ignored daily by patients, colleagues, and bosses. I am angry that my conservative friends/family immediately dismiss my LIVED sexist experiences any time I share. It SUCKS. I wish I had the confidence and gravitas of an under-qualified man. I really do.

Tomorrow, I pick up the mantle and fight again. But tonight, I'm just tired. Thanks for listening, ladies, love you all.

I saw a man I know vaguely through a friend of a friend, I recognised him immediately. I swiped left because I already know he has kids and wants more (he also stated as much in his profile), and I don‚Äôt want any kids at all. I don‚Äôt want to date a man who already has them because I don‚Äôt want kids in my life in any capacity and my profile makes that clear. Plus, I‚Äôm just not interested in him. Never have been. 

Today he has tracked me down on Facebook (we weren‚Äôt even friends on there) and sent me a message asking me, ‚Äúwhen are you going to swipe right on me? I swiped right on you‚Äù. I explained that I have since deleted the app so won‚Äôt be swiping right any time soon. Then he sent me a string of messages asking me out for a drink. I said no, I had already seen him on the app and swiped left cause I‚Äôm simply not interested. Queue a load more messages about giving him a chance and ‚Äúyou might like me if you got to know me‚Äù, and ‚Äúthis is why you‚Äôre single, because you write off nice men like me‚Äù.

Now, yes yes, I know that anti-feminist groups like MRAs and MGTOWs have their own little set of stats to say that men actually have it worse ('men are a majority of combat deaths', 'men are a majority of prisoners', 'men are a majority of suicides' etc) but let's remind ourselves why all of those points are basic statistical manipulations or rooted in hypocrisy:

**""Men are the vast majority of combat deaths in war‚Äù**

* Because for 99.9% of history, militaries and governments led exclusively by men deemed women too physically weak and biologically inferior to be in the army, so combat forces were solely comprised of men. Even today women are still excluded from combat roles in a lot of countries, and they were only allowed to start applying in developed world countries within the last 10 years (2013 in the U.S., 2016 in Australia and the U.K., etc). So obviously men will be the majority of combat deaths, since they have consistently decided they're the only ones fit and able enough to be out there. Plus this ignores civilian casualties of war, a lot of which are women.

**""Men are the majority of prisoners""**

* Men commit over 90% of all homicides, 86% of violent crimes and almost all sexual violence crimes. What do they expect the numbers to be, 50/50??

**""Men are the majority of suicides""**

* Women attempt suicide at 3 times the rate men do, and suffer from psychological disorders that lead to it twice as often. Men simply succeed in committing suicide more, despite attempting it far less often, because they typically choose more violent means such as putting a gun in their mouth or jumping off a building, whereas women choose less violent means such as taking pills and falling asleep, which give a much greater chance of something going wrong, changing your mind at the last second and calling for help or being found in time etc. 

**""Men may be the majority of high paying jobs, but they are also the majority of construction workers and brick layers""**

* Only because the toxic masculinity permeated throughout the trades effectively keeps women away from them. And some of these jobs pay a lot more than women make in fields they traditionally dominate such as teaching and social work. Plus, it's laughable hypocrisy to constantly talk about women not having a greater share of high prestige/high paying jobs because they CHOOSE not to do them, yet then ignore men CHOOSING to go into these types of fields. Last time I checked, nobody put a gun to their head and told them they had to work in construction.

People have tried to shut down women's causes and gaslight us for years, but on this Women's Day I say we take a stand to reaffirm our resolve, remember what we're fighting against - all that societal injustice - and NEVER let the likes of the MRAs, the both-sides crowd, men scared of losing their privilege or other unscrupulous individuals gaslight and trick us from continuing the fight.

Last Monday and the weekend before that were so amazing. We went to see our dream apartment that we were planning to buy, we went for lunch with his parents, next day a brunch with his fraternity brothers and their spouses. A beautiful ring on my finger. Wedding in August. Everyone so exicted. He changed his job almost a year ago and on Monday his first big project successfully went into production. He was the hero of the day. I had some impro classes that day, so came home a bit late. He in general was trying to live healthy to look his best for the wedding, but felt like celebrating therefore went to Mc Donalds. A glass of champagne in the evening. A tost, how awesome he is. A cat in the lap that we took as kitten last Easter. As he tends to snore I usually go to sleep a bit earlier we sleep in different rooms. Tuesday morning. I wake up and go to him for our morning cuddle. He is cold. Blue. Blood through nose. I panic, call the ambulance. Then they call the police as he was just 33. I call his mom.

No real reason why. Forensics wrote that something with the heart, but nothing precise as there was no crime, no violence, no poisoning, nothing. A young man just went to sleep and did not wake up.

Planning the funeral that will happen tomorrow. It will be at least twice as big as we were planning our wedding.

Hard to believe that this is really happening. Tomorrow I will see him for the last time ever. I‚Äôm spending a lot of time with his parents. He was their only son. All their hopes and dreams were put in him. I have no idea how our relationship will continue with them. We all need each others support, but I know that I cannot replace their son.

Nothing and no one to really blame. Perhaps his ex-girlfriend that was originally the love of his life ho just one day without mentioning a reason just left. During their relationship I know that some drugs were involved, so that probably fucked up his heart a bit more. But since we met, he has been using only some generic antidepressants and sometimes just a bit too much Whiskey, but nothing that could kill a 33 year old.

One thing that helps is the thought about moving out of my current apartment as it would feel too much to keep on living here. I will be moving in with a good friend of mine, therefore I will not be alone. Also I have to take care of the cats - mine that is 10 years old and grumpy and his that is almost 1 year old that is just pure love and positive energy.",TwoXChromosomes

1554841348.0,"I was screamed at for parking in a handicapped spot and accused of using a ""borrowed"" placard.","In front of a dozen plus people in a crowded parking lot.

I pulled into a handicap spot at my local grocery store this afternoon and had my placard hanging from the rearview mirror per standard procedure.  I get out and this guy in his car parked in a spot one row behind me sticks his head out of his open window and yells *""Excuse me, your in a handicap spot!""* in a really rude tone.

Look, I get it... I'm only in my 30's and appear younger.  I can walk and can do so in a way that appears normal.  I have no visible birth defects, deformity, or injuries.  There's no way he could've seen my handicap placard the way we were both parked.  So because of all these things listed, I politely said *""Yes sir, I know.  My handicap placard is hanging on my rearview mirror""*.  At this point I turn to continue walking into the store and HE GETS OUT OF HIS CAR AND STARTS SCREAMING AT ME!!!  Like, WTF???  In a crowded parking lot full of people!  He accused me of using someone else's placard and being a lazy, entitled princess cheating the system like a piece of shit and demanded I get back in my car and move to a regular spot because handicap spots aren't meant for spoiled bitches who think they're special.

At this point I just yelled back *""Why don't you mind your own business!  You don't know anything about me you fucking asshole!""*  I then spun around and walked into the store.  Thank God he didn't follow me.  Everyone in the parking lot had stopping dead watching this whole inappropriate scene and during this guys tirade several of them were shaking their heads and shooting dirty looks at me for using a handicapped spot.

I'm still so upset about the whole event even tho it's hours later and here's what I'd like that jerk and all the people who agreed with him to know......

When I was 18 yrs old I was in the passenger seat of a friend's car that was broadsided by a drunk driver traveling at approx 50mph.   The passenger door where I was sitting was the direct point of impact.  My hip was shattered in that accident along with cracking 2 of my vertebrae and causing a hairline fracture to my pelvis.  It took dozens of titanium screws, plates, pins, etc and hours of surgery to reconstruct my hip and stabilize my pelvis.  And then due to a previously unknown/undiagnosed autoimmune issue my body began rejecting the metal used to piece my hip back together.  It took me **YEARS** of medical intervention, physical therapy, pain, tears, strength and willpower to recover.  

It's been 20 years since then.  My gait appears normal when I walk *for SHORT distances*.  To much activity however can leave me nearly crippled in pain for days.  I deserve the handicap placard I was given. I need it.  Just because I'm not elderly or in a wheelchair doesn't mean I don't have a disability.  Not all disabilities are visually apparent and nobody should be making judgments about people they know nothing about.

I should be able to use my handicap placard without being harrassed and I don't deserve to have some guy scream insults at me on some misguided parking lot justice warrior crusade.  Whew.... I feel a lot better after getting that off my chest!  I'm really sorry it's so long y'all.",TwoXChromosomes
1650717296.0,'Teen' should be banned as a title or tag for porn on any porn website.,"Title basically.

Porn sites are full of content tagged or titled as teen. It is 'meant' to indicate actresses age 18 and 19, who are still technically teens. However, in our common perception, when someone says teen, we do not  think of the 18 or 19 year olds first. We think of the 12 - 16 year olds. We think of those who have braces and are getting picked up from school. We think of those who are in need of protection, especially from sexualization of adults.

Just using the word teen for porn, even though technically correct, lays a connection to view teens as sexual for any adult watching. Even if subconsciously. This is how our brains work though. We link together what we see together, and then we cannot always differentiate.

When I was still a teen, whether below or 18 and up, could not watch any porn tagged or titled with the word teen. Even when it was supposed to be my age. I just found it disgusting because for me the word teen immediately reminded me of actual underage teens and those were not people to be in porn or shown to have sex with adult men. To masturbate to that?  I could not. And I know other women and men who feel the same.

Seeing how so much content is titled or tagged as teen, how many of the set ups include teddy bears, school uniforms and all these other references of children and young teenagers, it is sickening. I have long stopped watching porn, towards the end of it I checked out sites like Chaturbate, because I felt there was at least some sort of autonomy of content creators. Yet, so many set-ups included these references to young teenagers.

Content with actresses and actors age 18 and 19 should be then be tagged differently. ~~Perhaps 18+ would be a better idea.~~  (edit) Young adult is an appropriate term (edit-end)

Has anyone else thought or read about this? What do you guys think it should be named instead? Also I've just formed the idea in my mind a few days ago after another post related to this topic. I believe it can be explained even better than I did, and probably also more scientifically (the impact of language etc.) so I am curious what you all have to say.  


EDIT: I wanted to take time this morning to read through the discussions, but wow. Thank you all for your sharing your input, views, reflections and experiences! And the awards (oh my, Gold, it will be spend wisely in this community!) Thank you! And yes I do have plans to continue this agenda and anyone who wants to join me, send a DM.   


So a few points to wrap this post up for now.   


* I agree, 18+ is just as bad as barely legal and not much better than teen. **Young adul**t would be the most appropriate turn.
* Incest, Step, Incel and others words (I am sorry If I missed some) should not have a placce there too. 
* The relationship between porn and assault came up in several responses. I hear all of you! I've been groomed myself at the age of 15.  We have every right to call for change and those who cannot understand it are just fortunate to not have made those experiences!   
 **If you can look at porn websites and not be triggered: GOOD FOR YOU!** But listen to those who have been assaulted as a teen by older men,  or by step-siblings or step-parents. Etc. Listen to those who have been sexualized. 
* To those saying media is a reflection of society, therefore you cannot change what it reflects. Well, **the relationship with media is a two way street: Yes, Media reflects our society. But media also shapes our society.** And in that media and language in media are powerful tools.   
So yes, Porn tagged teen reflects that teens are sexualized. 
   * Just 15 years ago media could OPENLY address the 18th birthday of female actors and singers and make creepy comments. Those comments still happen but have luckily received much backlash in public. 
   * Ironically, there was post in a non-English about porn consumption. Many men commented that they have stopped watching porn as they realized how it impacted the expectations and behaviors around sex which they took over without wanting or realizing at first.
* So, to everyone calling cancel culture and censorship. You have not realized that these words have no place on porn web sites. It is also NOT the ban the content it self, but to apply an appropriate  language. **That's cultural change not cancel culture nor censorship.** 
* Are you afraid someone could take your porn tag away, and you would be less aroused when looking for porn: **Congratulations you have realized the influence of language on your sexual desire!** 
* The concept of age and what's being a teen has been discussed. I figured that those constructs are also **culturally influenced**. So whether or not you'd commonly consider 18 or 19 year old ( not porn related) as teens might be a cultural aspect as well. On the other hand, some of those comments have been quite telling. I still stand with my point: teen is not a porn appropriate  term. Young adult is appropriate. 
* Yes I am thinking of starting a petition and to connect with people from scientific fields (language, social studies etc.).  I am thinking of ways in which the relationship could be tested. DM this is something you also think about. 
* and finally. yes. I am OKAY thank you weird Redditor who send the reddit concern bot. are you though? I think I know how it was and I think your reaction is quite telling. 
* Thank you Mods, for watching over and Thank ALL of you for reporting harassment and arguing respectfully!  

* Finally: I am beyond grateful that our society is becoming more and more reflective on media and language that surrounds us. When I was 20, I don't think this would have received the same response! We came this far and we will get even further!

1675132159.0,I can‚Äôt use DoorDash anymore.,"2nd UPDATE:
DoorDash has informed me that the person who owned that account has been banned from the platform. 

UPDATE:
I didn‚Äôt expect this outpouring of responses, but I‚Äôm even more horrified to learn that my experience with delivery services isn‚Äôt a unique one. I‚Äôm frustrated by the lengths that we have to go to in order to keep ourselves safe that were suggested here (using a masculine name, keeping men‚Äôs clothes in my apartment, etc). 

I contacted DoorDash last night after this happened. Since then, I‚Äôve emailed with someone from community response team, who had this response below:

‚ÄúThis sounds like it was a frightening incident and we appreciate you alerting us of this in such detail. This sort of behavior is a violation of our Community Guidelines and something we do not tolerate here at DoorDash. We want to assure you that we have investigated this incident and taken immediate and appropriate action by removing them from receiving any of your future deliveries to ensure the continued safety of our community.‚Äù 

I asked for clarification, but it sounds like DoorDash has not removed the account the Dasher was using, only blocked the Dasher‚Äôs account from picking up any of my future orders. I‚Äôm really disappointed, but not shocked, that more isn‚Äôt being done about this issue. 

Most businesses and roads are shut down due to the winter weather, so I will be checking with them tomorrow (if the weather has cleared) for security camera footage of the parking lot.

Original Post:

Ordered DoorDash as a part of my company‚Äôs dinner policy tonight. I‚Äôve done this many times and never had a driver have issues parking in the public garage of my apartment lot or get lost. The apartment complex has large, lit signs and clear arrows pointing into the parking lot off of a major road. Both Google and Apple Maps will route you there correctly and the garage is well lit and equipped with cameras. I‚Äôve never felt unsafe meeting someone here. 

My dasher, ‚ÄúJessica‚Äù texted me that she was in the parking lot for businesses next door, to come quickly because it‚Äôs cold, and that she had my food ready. I jogged over to the parking lot with my boyfriend and it was pitch dark, except for the car‚Äôs headlights being on.

We came around the side of the car and saw there was a man in the driver‚Äôs seat, alone, with his pants down. He quickly pulled up his pants in the driver‚Äôs seat and threw our order at us before peeling out of the parking lot. 

My name is very clearly feminine on my account. The Dasher also had a very clearly feminine name. I didn‚Äôt mention that someone was coming with me to get my food. The Dasher asked me to meet them in a dark, odd place. I keep trying to think of ways that I might have misconstrued this situation in my head, but I think something bad would‚Äôve happened if my boyfriend hadn‚Äôt come with me. 

I‚Äôve escalated this to DoorDash and they‚Äôre supposed to call me later. I feel sick to my stomach about what could‚Äôve happened and I hope this helps warn other people.",TwoXChromosomes

I used to be super big into gaming in the late 2000‚Äôs, and had a mic and everything to chat with people online.

I would hear all the stupid shit like ‚Äúmake me a sandwich‚Äù and ‚Äúget back in the kitchen‚Äù, and all the boys would laugh.

He screamed about how I need to shut my mouth, he didn‚Äôt ask me to talk. We all kinda laughed because we thought he was joking, but he started taking it further, verbally abusing me because I was a woman.

Immediately the other men in the game start going at him. Yelling at him, making fun of him, and defending me. He was silenced pretty quick by this group of fantastic gentlemen.

1544690838.0,Why does no one talk about what happens after you‚Äôre raped?,"I feel like people really only talk about what happens during a rape, but people really don‚Äôt know what happens after. At least, I didn‚Äôt until I was raped. 


I‚Äôm a college girl in  Southern Colorado in a really small town, and it was Halloween night. Both me and a friend were drugged and raped. I vaguely remember the assault, but nothing significant. I could put the pieces together because my nipple piercings hurt and so did my vagina. A day later I told my mom, and she told me to go to the er to get tested. 


When I went to the ER they do something called a SANE (sexual assault nurse examination ) exam. Basically, I was stuck in the ER for 8 hours while they took my blood, gave me preventative STI meds and shots, and asked me over and over what happened. They asked if I wanted police or photo evidence taken (I declined both) 


The actual examination is the worst part. The nurse took me into a bright room that was cold and scary. She had me strip everything off on a potty pad for dogs to collect any skin cells. I changed into a gown and she examined every single inch of my body for any bruising. She took fingernail clippings, hair follicles, and mouth swabs. 

The hardest part for me was the female exam because that‚Äôs where I had the most trauma, so it was really painful. She took some swabs and used a blue dye on the tearing I had. After everything she explained to me the trauma she found and oh my god it‚Äôs so hard to hear. I don‚Äôt remember anything and hearing what she found tore me apart. My mom was in the room with me and she started to cry. She never cries. 


The nurse sent me home with a huge stack of information and things that I had to do. I was on preventative HIV meds for an entire month. These meds make you SICK. I could t even leave my bed without constantly throwing up. I felt like I was dying it was so bad. They give you headaches, extreme nausea, and body aches. 
It‚Äôs not over after that. I had to check up with an infectious disease doctor. I have to get tested for HIV next week, again in three months, six months, and then a year. 

The men that did this to me have probably forgotten it by now. But I haven‚Äôt. Because of them, I‚Äôm going to be stuck getting prodded with needles for an entire year, while all these doctors talking to me are looking at my like I‚Äôm. Helpless victim. 

Rape isn‚Äôt something that you can get over quickly. I‚Äôm gonna have to deal with this shit for a year, probably more. I just wanted to voice my frustration with my situation... 


Edit: thank you all for the support. It was so hard to talk about, but i think it‚Äôs important people know the realities of rape. The trauma is so long term. 

I also wanted to say that I chose not to report because it‚Äôs terrifying. I‚Äôm honestly scared to find out who did this to me, and see their faces.

I have my own experience that I don‚Äôt really talk about very much because it‚Äôs still so painful, but I feel that it‚Äôs important to talk about what happened and how everything went wrong because I don‚Äôt want anyone to ever have to go through the same hellish experiences that I‚Äôve gone through for the last 5 years.

I was training for my first triathlon in the summer of 2015, I spent a lot of time outdoors and was working on upping my cycling times. I went out on a nice Sunday evening but what I didn‚Äôt know was that some jackass put a trip wire on the trail at a downhill 90 degree turn. I struck it at nearly 25 mph. I had a lot of injuries all of which were minimized or missed completely. They missed a skull fracture (that one almost killed me and I ended up getting emergency surgery later at another hospital a few days later) and minimized my orthopedic injuries. I had fractures from my heel to my femur in my left leg and all I got told was that I had a badly sprained ankle. I kept insisting that something was wrong and I wanted an MRI ‚Äì I have never felt pain like that before (or since) and I could not stop crying. We were sent home anyway.

I was in physical therapy for a year solid without any real improvements. They kept telling me that my pain shouldn‚Äôt have been that bad, that I just wasn‚Äôt trying and that I was faking my lack of mobility because I didn‚Äôt do the exercises. It really damaged my soul to hear those things because I knew something was wrong the whole time ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt bend my toes, had foot drop, and a deep, sharp pain that never went away. I went through four orthopedic surgeons who didn‚Äôt even want to do x-rays much less an MRI even though my left leg was misshaped and atrophied. I got labeled a liar and overdramatic which didn‚Äôt help in finding a physician that would listen.

I was fortunate that I didn‚Äôt give up and found a surgeon who suggested a nerve study and did an MRI ‚Äì turns out I was right all along. My ankle was a mess of poorly healed fractures, avascular necrosis, and all the major nerves in my leg died about mid-calf (likely from undetected compartment syndrome ‚Äì kinda lucky I didn‚Äôt die). I literally wept with relief because I finally knew what was wrong and that it wasn‚Äôt my fault ‚Äì  but it couldn‚Äôt be fixed. Too much time had passed for a nerve graft to be useful and I was starting to develop tumors on the tissue that was still damaged and slowly dying. We tried to salvage it for a few years, but eventually it was just a losing battle and I had an amputation last year.

I‚Äôm doing relatively well and am in a lost less pain now, but I still have a lot of built up anger that I don‚Äôt think is going anywhere anytime soon. My wife and I tried to go after malpractice with the help of our health insurance company but even they said that it would be too difficult since the burden of proving knowing negligence was on us. That and with tort reform in Texas it would end up costing us more than any restitution we‚Äôd be able to get. So, we‚Äôre kinda just stuck eating the cost of prosthesis care which is estimated to add up to about 300-500k over the course of my lifetime.

I still sometimes feel like I could have done something different ‚Äì that maybe if I had been louder or more insistent that someone would have listened. So I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs really any good advice I can give other than be persistent, have someone there who can help you advocate for yourself, and that there are independent or insurance provided patient advocates that can be helpful if you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre being listened to.

&#x200B;

Edit: I keep getting advice to sue, and we've tried. My wife is an attorney and her law firm has referred us to other firms multiple times and we've also spoken with attornies from our health insurance - none of them have recommended pursuing it for a variety of reasons. We don't have the money to take on a hospitals legal team. That and the last time we requested my full medical records from the hospital they said they didn't have them - we've also filled paperwork against the hospital for not keeping the records for the required 7 year period in our state. So all we have are the discharge papers and a disc with my broke elbow on it but none of the other x-rays.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: I called up my wife to ask about maybe pursuing this again, and she told me that we could try but we're now up against the statute of limitation for filing a medical malpractice claim - which is two years in Texas. So, I'm not sure how that's going to go.",TwoXChromosomes

1603208241.0,IUD insertion pain INCREDIBLY downplayed,"Disclaimer: not worrying about kids for 10 years was worth it.

It‚Äôs been a few months since I got my copper iud, but I‚Äôm still angry about this. 

So I was advised to adopt a non hormonal form of birth control due to my slight predisposition for hormone fed breast cancer. The copper IUD is the only option really so I set up an appointment to have it inserted. It was free with my insurance! I was not told to prepare in any way, I was not warned at all or advised to plan around this. Even the internet did not give me an inkling of the pain associated with the procedure.

I drove myself to the appointment. I took no Advil. My doctor told me I would feel ‚Äúsome pressure‚Äù and some ‚Äúmild cramping similar to menstrual cramps‚Äù that would be ‚Äúgone by the time you leave.‚Äù

The actual placement was the single most painful thing I‚Äôve ever experienced. The first time since childhood that I actually involuntarily screamed from pain. I felt like I was going to faint and was lying their in pain while my male doctor just stood there and stared awkwardly as I cried. I felt ashamed and poked at and violated. 

When I was finally able to go I had to drive home by myself (stick shift so lots of abdominal engagement fml), and to this day I don‚Äôt know how I made it. The next 3 days were the worst cramps I‚Äôve ever experienced and pooping was a nightmare. 

It seems to be a theme that women are under informed about these things, and frequently not given pain killer when it would be appropriate.

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else experienced this, or if my pain was worse than normal. I hope this doesn‚Äôt scare people away from IUDs, as I do think it was worth not having to take the pill every day. I just want people to know to take painkiller and take work off and maybe request an anesthetic for this procedure.",TwoXChromosomes
1612704230.0,Fuck You Bill Maher. Fuck you.,"I have watched Bill Maher for quite some time. Ive enjoyed his show despite the fact that I disagree with him on many many things. I enjoy having an open mind, listening to people who disagree with me, engaging in civil dialogue to explore theoretical topics, all that bullshit. 

But Im beyond that now Bill--fuck you. 

I cant believe I saw an entire panel defend rapists, misogynists, and the gruesome things done by Armie Hammer. I cant believe I saw an entire panel, that was in front of an enthusiastically clapping audience, victim blame women who have described rape, torture, and various terrible events. I cant believe the response on the Maher sub is ""who even is Armie Hammer?"" and my personal favorite ""who cares?""

Fuck that--I care. I care about these women and their experience.

Bill spent the whole show fucking complaining. He thinks he has more right to complain about local municipal issues than women have to complain about men abusing them? He has more of a right to complain about ""cancel culture"" than the women have to complain that they were abused?

I cant believe I heard a panelist say the carved ""A"" in a woman's side was ""small, like a tattoo"" and isnt a problem. I cant believe Bill Maher said ""Armie is an alpha shark what do you expect."" The entire conversation was unbelievable. 

But of course, its perfectly believable. As a rape victim I recognize this rhetoric. It's rhetoric that most of us (even those of us not personally brutalized by rape or abuse) recognize. Its something we have heard time and again. We have heard it from colleagues (dont report that assault to HR, youll make yourself a target), from our government (""they just let you do it--you can grab them by the pussy--you can do anything"".), from our entertainment (hi bill). 

I have been open-minded, patient, etc. Something that has NOT been returned by the host--Bill will blame ""cancel culture"" for any backlash here. He will refuse to take blame, he will refuse to educate himself or to learn.

1660147061.0,I got 2 misogynists fired and I'm over the moon about it,"I'm a people manager at a large corporation, and a member of a team that I manage remotely came to me yesterday because she was being harassed by someone, who I'll call Jay, in a department that we work closely with. When I asked her to sit down to discuss the issue in private, she let me know that another member of her team (NB, female presenting) wanted to join the conversation. 

It turned out that Jay not only harassed members of my team (repeatedly asking them out and getting upset when they would say no, as well as invading their space at every opportunity), he and his coworker, Bob, would routinely follow, ogle, and make comments about any other female presenting person they would encounter. What makes it all extra gross is that Bob is also extremely religious, and would tell unmarried women who cohabitated with their partners that they were living in sin and needed to repent to god - all while staring at women's asses and making comments to his coworker about how they're tempting him to sin.

I immediately opened up a case with HR and told my manager. This morning, I sat down with Jay and Bob's manager, who didn't even need all of the details that I had ready before letting me know that they would be gone before the end of the day.

The employees who reported are feeling guilty, but I keep reminding them that they didn't get anyone fired - Jay and Bob got themselves fired for being grossly unprofessional.

We all huddled in a group so everyone could hear what everyone was saying. The pregnant coworker then turned to me & told me ‚Äúyour going to love having kids when you have them one day.‚Äù 

I briefly just mentioned I wasn‚Äôt interested in having kids. She gave me the usual comment‚Äôs like everyone else does. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll change your mind.‚Äù I just shrugged the comment off & moved on.

For days on end he would send me articles about why women should have kids & then he started saying ‚Äúour population is going to die out if you guys stop getting knocked up.‚Äù & other comments related to that. 

I kept ignoring him. He never talked to me at work like this, only over text. So I didn‚Äôt think he was a threat. So I moved on, again. Until one day I couldn‚Äôt ignore it.

As I walked faster, the van pulled ahead of me and stopped, and I could see two men inside silhouetted against the streetlight beyond.

I started making a wide berth around the back of the van, and immediately, one of the men leaned out of the passenger side door, and said, smiling, ""Hey, I love your dog - what kind is that? He's beautiful! He a boxer? HEY! Lemme see!""

I walked faster and hoped they couldn't see my legs shaking. Last thing I heard was, ""We were only being FRIENDLY, BITCH,"" and the scream of their tires.

And in that moment, I felt a pang of guilt. *For being ""mean"" to those two men.* Seriously. Yet if I **had** been been friendly to those creeps, and they ended up groping or grabbing me, *I would then have felt guilty for putting myself in a situation I knew was dangerous.*

Anyhoo.. things are going hot and heavy and like the girl scout I am, I reach into the nightstand and pull out a condom.

I knew *immediately* that this was going to be an issue and that I'd made a mistake.   He wanted to discuss it in bed, but I insisted we gather our clothing back on and head out to the living room for a discussion.

His attitude was snarky, condescending and his words were designed to make ME feel bad about insisting on condoms.   He couldn't *believe* that I didn't trust him.  How could I have sex with him if I didn't trust him 100%?  (HA!)   

Honestly, if I had ANY small amount of trust for someone I met 3 weeks ago it'd certainly gone out the window with this display.  Who the hells knows what you have or your recent partners might because you are obviously into high risk sex.   

His next tactic is trying to convince me that ""Safety is an illusion"" that I was being stupid, illogical, and an overly-cautious, silly female. 

I said, ""Has that actually worked for you before? Because that's the most bullshit thing I ever heard.  Life is full of risks, so nothing is ever 100% safe but it's perfectly reasonable and logical to at least take precautions.   Do you wear a seatbelt in the car? Safety glasses if you are using a saw? A helmet for riding a bike?  Those activities can kill you but you still use reasonable precautions, right?   The very fact that you are trying to make me feel crazy and wrong for wanting you to wear a condom lets me know we are never going to be compatible and you can fuck right off. Seriously. "" 

I walked over to the front door, opened it and said, ""Please leave.  Now."" 

He asked if this meant I was breaking it off with him.  Hell yes, I am.  He said he ""couldn't believe it that I would break it off over something so trivial"" and was refusing to leave. 

The chutzpah of this guy just pissed me off.   Yeah, my health, so fucking trivial dude.  

I grabbed his overnight bag and the shirt he'd brought on a hanger and threw them out into the hallway. ""I'm not wasting another breathe on you, asshole.  Get out NOW or I'm calling the cops.""

He did finally leave and I immediately locked the door, blocked his phone number and  email address and haven't spoken to him since.  

Good riddance to bad rubbish.

The crazy thing is that his responses and arguments were something that he's practiced before.  He was too slick and too prepared.    He's done this before, maybe a bunch of times before.

When I was 18 I was raped and became pregnant. I wanted to have an abortion first but it was illegal so I couldn't.

&#x200B;

I'll always remember how the nurse looked at me with just disgust like ""ugh, another one"" - college nurse.

&#x200B;

I felt so ashamed. So ashamed. I also had come from an abusive childhood and I had no idea how to ask for help or anything of the sort.

&#x200B;

The more people I went to for help at the time the more shame I felt and the more I just wanted to hide. In the end, adoption was the option presented to me.

&#x200B;

I hid myself, my pregnancy from the vast majority of people in my life.

&#x200B;

When I had her, I wanted her so much. I held her and I loved her like you wouldn't imagine. I wanted her.

&#x200B;

But then I gave her up. And I just, I existed. I felt so ashamed. I've confided in 1 person who I do trust but even then I assume they must think I have to be a bit of a monster for what I did.

&#x200B;

I found out she became ill. And then she was in the hospital. And she didn't make it.

&#x200B;

I don't know how I am supposed to feel. On one hand its like I don't get to be sad, I gave her away so I don't get that, only her family get that. On the other hand I am shaken to my core and I just don't know what to do.

1549895400.0,My 75 year old eye doctor told me I have an expiration date as a woman,"I went to the eye doctor this weekend at a new office. The optometrist was in his mid 70s and was super nice through the first half of the exam. He asked me some vague personal questions one of which was if I was married and I informed him that I had a partner of 3 years but no, we weren't married. It didn't seem weird, it was just small talk I thought. Then after I went through the 1 no 2 no 1 portion he pushed the optical thing away from my face and leaned in close to me and placed his hand on my knee. I was already getting uncomfortable but then he started lecturing me, saying that I better make my boyfriend marry me or else he would lose interest and leave me and that I was getting old to not be married yet. I cut him off saying, ""I don't want to discuss this"" but I was trapped with him sitting in front of me blocking me form standing up plus he had my glasses so I couldn't see. He was arguing with me saying he was telling me this for my own good and that he was being ""fatherly"" but I didn't back down just kept repeating ""I don't want to discuss this."" I had to say it 4 times before he stopped, and he had the nerve to respond with, ""well I don't want to discuss it anymore either."" And I grabbed my glasses and my prescription and left in tears.

1603821704.0,"I fought for an ""extra mammogram"" and I was right","I had a check-up mammogram scheduled today.

Earlier this year they found suspicious lumps in both breasts. The right lump was large enough to ultrasound and biopsy (benign, yay!) but the left lump was too small to do much about. I vividly remember the day all of this happened because 1) it wasn't that long ago, and 2) I am 32 and definitely not the average age group for this.

Well today when I go in with the tech to get my mammogram, she tells me we are only scanning my right breast. I say that's incorrect, they are scanning both. She double checks my file and says no, look right here- it says your left breast was totally fine.

This back and forth continues for TWO HOURS.

She checks with a nurse. Then the doctor at the imaging center. Then I call my doctor who referred me in the first place. Everyone is telling me that my file says my left breast was totally normal and needed no further scanning.

I say at least a dozen times: *I don't know what to tell you, the file is wrong. I was told we needed to make sure nothing got bigger in my left breast.*

I was belittled. I was treated like I was being hysterical and difficult. It was insinuated I was making things harder for other patients who ""need access to the mammogram"" (as if I was personally holding the machine hostage...? What? I offered to wait in the waiting room, you weirdo??) and worst of all I was told if I got an ""unnecessary"" scan then my insurance wouldn't cover it and I'd be stuck with the bill. I'm in grad school. That's a terrifying reality. But fine, I said. I'll pay full cost. Do both breasts.

The tech did it and was so annoyed with me the entire time I could feel it just radiating off of her. I was wasting her time and she sure didn't mind letting me know it.

Ten minutes after they finally scanned BOTH breasts, a different tech called me into a consultation room and told me: **you have a concerning mass in your left breast and we need you to come back this afternoon for an ultrasound.**

I immediately burst into tears. I'm terrified that there has been *that* amount of growth in just a few months- enough to warrant an ultrasound when that definitely was not the case last time. But mostly I'm proud of myself. I'm so proud I pushed. I'm so proud I advocated for myself.  Even though I cried the entire time and felt like an idiot and absolutely had OTHER SHIT TO DO TODAY. I'm proud.

And if I see that tech when I go back in two hours for my ultrasound, I will say nothing. Because she must feel like shit.

UPDATE: No need for biopsy, doc says it‚Äôs nothing. I am so tired and want to forget this awful day. Thank you all for the kind words.

UPDATE 2: It's after 7pm where I am- my doctor just called and she is PIISSEDDDD. The disconnect that happened was a logistical issue that was made 10000% worse by the folks working at the imaging center- she was as baffled as I was that no one just freaking called her. When I called her office to try to figure out what was happening I had to talk to 80 different nurses and everything took way too long because a patient is not a great go-between when trying to explain medical stuff. The imaging center people should have called. My doctor ended up CALLING IN A MAMMOGRAM FOR MY LEFT BREAST. NO ONE AT THE IMAGINING CENTER TOLD ME THIS!!! 

She's also angry they didn't describe the results of the ultrasound very well: they found a cyst and they also saw that my lymph node was enlarged. I was not told that. She says the results are ""gray area"" enough, and I am young enough, that it makes sense they didn't explain well/take it super seriously, but also she would fully support me in getting a second opinion and filing a formal complaint if I so wish. Based on the mess that was today, plus the fact that I have a grandparent that died of breast cancer (we also have bone and colon cancer just all up in my immediate family)- I'm going to meet with her soon and discuss what I'd like to do- both with my healthcare and with reporting the tech. 

I'm looking forward to sitting down very soon with a warm and helpful medical professional who supports me and can help me figure out my options. I feel so much better. Thank god she called me. 

SIDE NOTE: For insurance purposes, does it matter that she called in the mammogram AFTER they had already done it? From what my doctor says it sounds like they called it in before the imaging folks even told me I needed an ultrasound- so that's a ten-minute window max. How significant is the timing here?

1563028425.0,"Took me a long time to realize my boyfriend was essentially sexually assaulting me every weekend morning. I broke up with him, and this is the most liberating morning I‚Äôve had in years!","The first year my bf and I dated, it really was bliss. The second year we dated is when it went downhill. I had gotten an IUD so we could have unprotected sex, but the IUD changed sex for me. It was pretty tender for the first entire year I had the device. It also dried me up and killed my libido. 

That‚Äôs when I learned of his impatience. 

He never took the time to talk to me about why I might not want to have sex. He didn‚Äôt care that I might have shooting, cramping pain if I did it when I wasn‚Äôt ready. He was selfish. He was concerned that I wasn‚Äôt attracted to him so he would lash out, then give me the silent treatment if I didn‚Äôt want to have sex. He was always minimizing everything about how I might feel. Cramping? Oh, try getting kicked in the balls! Spare me with that shit. 

Every weekend morning, it was either right when my eyes opened, or whenever he deemed that I should be awake, he would start groping me. I am not a morning person, you don‚Äôt wake me before I am ready because it legit ruins my whole day. I either had to let him grope me until we had sex or I gave him some sort of job. I would be pissy beyond belief that I was being handled at such an hour when all I wanted to do was slowly wake up, scroll through reddit, and listen to the birds chirp. 

If I said no, he would roll over and give me the silent treatment, then he‚Äôd leave me for the entire day almost immediately. There was no ‚Äúlet me sleep a little longer and then we can do it.‚Äù He interpreted that as a flat out rejection, and he‚Äôd still roll over, give me the silent treatment, and leave. If I did let him hit it, he‚Äôd just stay a little longer before he left. After a while I would just pretend to sleep a little bit longer- if I woke up and needed to move, I‚Äôd stay in that uncomfortable position just so he wouldn‚Äôt know I was awake. He believed, and in turn made me believe, that if there was no sex then what‚Äôs the point of him coming over? Having sex eventually turned into ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do this now to spare a fight later.‚Äù 

I broke up with him last Tuesday, I did it on a whim. I was sick of his conceit, manipulation, and seemingly insatiable sexual desire. This is the first Saturday in two years that I feel comfortable. There is no pressure to perform. It took me to get to this day, right now, to realize how much I actually dreaded waking up next to him. 

Today I am liberated, and it feels so fucking good that I need to tell the world!

As an adult both of these ""truths"" were very frustrating for me. It had led to many a situationship and going to fun bars alone wishing I had girlfriends instead of being hit on by men who specifically only want to get in my pants.

Then I started dating this man and it was just... Easy. We just enjoyed each other's company and I wasn't trying to impress him or anything. At some point I started falling for him but here I was again, at an impasse. We were everything like a couple but did not have the label and while one can die on the hill of labels not meaning much, it meant something to ME. So... I asked him to be my boyfriend. He smiled and didn't hesitate to say yes.

That was a little over a week ago. Two nights ago, I was at a bar alone. I again found myself wishing I had girl friends. Then a girl went up to my table to ask me a question about one of her photos. I gave her my input then asked if I could join her table of other girls as I was alone and wanted to make new friends.

I've been drinking a lot of tea today, so nature calls and have to go pee. So I get up and go to the bathroom. I come back, not being stealthy by any means. I look over and see he's in a zone so I don't say anything so as not to distract him. I get back on the couch and back in my zone. About 5 minutes go by, both just quietly working. Then he farts, loudly. I can't pretend I didn't hear it. So I look up expecting to make some joke so he doesn't feel bad. He doesn't respond. Doesn't even move. I think ""well okay, I guess we're there in our relationship."" About 10 more minutes go by. He suddenly looks over and says, ""You're back. I thought you were still in the bathroom. That is why I farted."" He proceeds to be really embarrassed and I think it's the most hilarious and adorable thing ever and I love him so much.


Edit: I sent him the post. He said he's happy his fart is getting me so many upvotes.

All throughout highschool I have had a perfect average in math. I worked quite hard for it and I'm very proud of it. 
There is a boy in my class who's crazy about physics. 

There is friendly competition between us but so far I seem to be the clear cut winner in math and we are about the same level in physics.

Now, This guy spends his life studying physics and math. It's a respectable hobby. 


However here comes my problem.
Everyone in my class is convinced that I am the hardworking girl and he is the gifted smart boy.


No one will ever say that I'm smart. No. I'm just hardworking. I just work hard. Nothing more.

He works more than I do. I get better results. He is gifted. He is very smart.


A few days ago we were talking and I complimented his intelligence. He told me in return ""You are not smart, but you work hard. It's respectable.""

I couldn't keep myself from just blurting out
""Fuck you. I'm smart."" 
I finally felt like I was about to explode. I asked him to class the people in our class by their intelligence. He put every boy before me. 

Fuck it. I don't care if I'm labelled crazy narcissistic for thinking I'm smart. He can go around boast about his intelligence no problem. I can't. I don't care.

Thing is I'm not alone. Every girl I meet thinks that their sucess is hard work while boys think it's their intelligence. We work equally.


Fuck this mentality. Yes I work hard. But yes I'm also smart. As smart as a boy.

Edit 1: Hey I really didn't think this would blow up! So to clarify some things: I'm not mad at the boy. He is actually a friend of mine. I am mad about the mentality that we have. We are still friends with him and I think I now have the courage to talk to people about this instead of responding with a ""fuck you"". I believe my post came off pretty aggressive, and with a second read I see I should have made myself clearer. 

Edit 2: After going through the comments I see some themes getting repeated often:

Yeah, just like everyone I do care what people think of me. I should grow a thicker skin that's for sure. But this mentality goes deep and we should tell girls that they are smart! It's hard to just live in your own bubble!

And does school work show off intelligence? Well not really! But nothing does!

When I say that I am smart I don't mean smarter than others. Just like everyone can be beautiful in their own way, everyone can be smart in their own way! I am good with academics, others are good with music, others with social skills. I'm mad about how we refrain from using the word smart. ",TwoXChromosomes

And what I‚Äôve found is that everyone I talk to knows *what* they want to happen (abortion=murder) and *why* (life beginning when sperm meets egg) but none of these people ever know *How* to do it.

So I ask them how they intend to enforce it. I usually get some iteration of ‚Äújust like a murder‚Äù but then I pry more.

How do you investigate the difference between an abortion and miscarriage? Does this mean a woman who just suffered a traumatic miscarriage of a wanted baby will be interrogated like a murder suspect at the hospital? Will you go around interviewing her friends and family? What kind of science can you run to determine the difference?

And lastly, fertility clinics. I have never found anti-abortionist who has thought about fertility clinics. Fertility clinics and research institutes dispose of more fertilized embryos in half a decade than planned parenthood has throughout its entire history. Hell my sister had 20 on deck right now after her battle with infertility.

Not one anti-abortion person can tell me what to do with fertility clinics. Does my sister get charged? If she has 20 on deck but is already 36‚Äì she cannot possibly carry them all to term‚Äî do you forcefully implant them in other women? Do you force my sister to watch other parents raise her children?

Instead, he's been so unbelievably supportive and he's become the single most important person in the world to me.

When school closed for the year instead of going back to my dad who called me a ""harlot"" when he found out I was pregnant and said that the baby probably wasn't my boyfriend's (accusation he made), I was invited to stay with him and his parents. I feel so at home here. I guess this is what a family is supposed to feel like.

His folks insist I call them mom and dad. They never scold me or yell about Jesus. They don't care that me and their son sleep in the same bed (my parents would throw us out for that).

In a well known Dutch childrens book a mother is making breakfast in the kitchen and the father walks by and steps on his bike to ride to work (without saying hello to his wife). He would say the HUSBAND was making food and the WIFE left to go to work.

He would change other things as well like he would have girls play in the mud, instead of braiding hair, and he would have boys who didn't like soccer. My grandma, who was also a teacher, would sometimes look around the corner and listen to how he changed the stories because she loved the reaction of the kids. She said that at first they were confused ""Huhhh??? Why is their mum going to work??"" But soon they wouldn't notice and find comfort in that not every girl has to braid and not every girl has to play soccer.

Unless you agree with them, but this post isn‚Äôt for you. This applies to any of my fellow ladies (including trans) who are pro-choice and choose to be sexually active. 

First, you really should be sleeping with people who align with your views, so in the off chance you find yourself in an unexpected position, there‚Äôs no surprises. 

Second, by their own admission, they think sex should only be for procreating. So they shouldn‚Äôt be looking for, or enjoying, casual hook ups or recreational sex anyway. Especially when they shift the responsibilities, consequences, and shame onto the women while they reap the benefits. 

Thirdly, maybe when they notice how batshit insane their theoretical arguments are in real-life practice, they‚Äôll change their opinions and perhaps their voting patterns. 

Fourthly, it‚Äôs looking real good that access to abortion AND affordable birth control might be taken away from us (Americans) soon. If you‚Äôre gonna be sleeping with any man, make sure it‚Äôs with a man who didn‚Äôt make that choice so much more riskier for you and your fellow ladies.

They don‚Äôt want women sleeping around? Fine. Don‚Äôt sleep with **them!**


ETA: What‚Äôs worse? Living in an oppressive society that wants women to have no control over their own bodies, or asking someone what their voting habits are before sleeping with them?

And some *will* lie, but you know what? I‚Äôd rather have them lie and hide than have them feel safe enough to spread their propaganda and view to anyone else. (That‚Äôs how we got the radicalized alt-right.) So many men already lie to get their dicks wet, and you‚Äôre gonna let that stop you from not even *trying* to stand up for reproductive rights? Anti-choice men don‚Äôt deserve your pussy. 

And yes, a lot of religious, anti-choice men who think women shouldn‚Äôt have sex unless they want a child hold a double standard for themselves and go out and have casual, pre-marital sex anyway. My post above was simply stating the double standard and that they take advantage of the situation yet still want to remove women‚Äôs autonomy anyway.

Women of childbearing age being basically all women over 14 and under 60. 

Nevermind how not all women might want to get pregnant, or be able to get pregnant. Clearly if a woman is within the childbearing age it's random chance whether a baby suddenly appears inside her. Nothing could predict it. (/s)

It annoys me to no end how clearly they think of women as nothing more than baby making machines. This isn't about the health of women, it's about the health of hypothetical babies. Because if it was about the health of the women, they'd have said it about men first, as they are more at risk from early death caused by alcohol (as stated earlier in the same article, in 2016 it caused 2.3 million deaths in men, 0.7 million deaths in women). 

It feels like it's about controlling women.

If it was about childrens health, they wouldn't only care about maternal drinking. Multiple studies have found paternal drinking to the same disorders found from maternal drinking. So why isn't the advice ""Attention should be given to preventing people trying to convieve a child from drinking""? Why is it only about controlling what women do?

She's in a lab and they're doing ekg (I think) training/demonstrations today and they have to have a male and female example but she's the only female in the class so she's pretty much being forced to be the example. The professor told her that she has to wear a sports bra because she'll need to take her shirt off, and she is (understandably) not comfortable doing that in front of a bunch of guys. She said that she'll fail the lab if she doesn't do it. I told her to refuse to do it and go to the head of the department or the dean of students and explain the situation.

Sorry for the long post and any bad formatting (I'm on mobile), but I just wanted to vent and get your thoughts and opinions on the situation because I think it is absolutely ridiculous that she's being put in this situation to begin with.

Edit: I was not expecting this to get so much attention, so thank you all for all of your replies! Apparently the class is not today but tomorrow so I will update you on what happens

Edit 2: Okay so I just talked to my girlfriend and got a better understanding of the situation. There are actually two instructors for the lab and they're both males around 25 years old. I was incorrect about her being the only female in the class. The instructors split the class into two groups for this and her group is mostly male football players with a few other females. The instructors chose her to be the example because the other females are apparently ""bigger"" and the instructors don't want to make them uncomfortable (but apparently it's okay for my girlfriend to be /s). The instructors did not say that she would fail if she refused to be the example, but she is afraid that she'll lose points. My girlfriend also told me that the instructors usually mess with her in class (not in a bad way, but how teachers do with students they like), and now they chose her to be the example for this.

As you can tell, I am obviously not okay with this but she most definitely is not either. She decided that she is going to refuse to be the example and if anything negative comes of it she'll go to higher-ups.


Final edit: Sorry for taking so long to reply, I've been really busy with work. 

So my girlfriend had the class yesterday and when she got there her sugar got low (she's a type 1 diabetic), so she left to go get something to eat. By the time she got back to class another girl had volunteered to be the example. So in the end she didn't have to be the example, and the instructors didn't even make her participate because of her sugar.

I know a lot of people think I exaggerated the whole situation for attention but I honestly just misunderstood what she had originally told me, so I apologise for that.

I woke up to hundreds of congratulatory comments, as well as a bunch of PMs from guys who didn't want to post anything publicly but still wanted to let me know that my story, and the many similar stories in the comments, were proof that 'females' were working together to keep 'men' down.  I apparently stole my new job from some hard working man out there who went the traditional route of getting the education and experience required.  One guy even gleaned from my comment history that I'm childless by choice and married, and therefore don't even need a high paying job, and it's women like me that are keeping the unemployment rate for men higher than women (?!?!).

So first of all, skyrocketing housing prices in my area of Canada definitely require two substantial incomes, regardless of any other point.  But more importantly, and I can't stress this enough, there is NOT a finite number of jobs out there.  When more people (aka women as well as men) work, more people have more money to spend, which they generally do, and therefore more products and services are required and more jobs are created.  When jobs go to the right person, regardless of their background, that company does better and... well, tbh shareholders probably make more money, but hopefully other companies are forced to hire more qualified people to compete.

From my perspective he hasn't been interested, and I attributed that to my weight gain and I told him so.

Examples include trying to take my towel off after I came out of the shower, trying to snuggle up to me in bed and I refused to allow him to touch me under the blankets, etc.

I had truly been thinking that he found me repulsive and I was actually considering telling him to sleep with other women (he takes care of himself... still in great shape after 20 years of marriage) but when I said to him ""you have a problem with me being fat"" he looked me dead in the eye and said ""I don't have a problem with you being fat. YOU have a problem with you being fat.""

And he's right. He has never made me feel unattractive or unworthy... He is still very much attracted to me and it's my own self conscious that has prevented me from being intimate with him because I feel like I'm less than he deserves.

Today I went to the doctor to inquire about it & it was an emotional disaster. As soon as my PA came in she asked if I was sexually active which I said yes as I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for nearly 3 years. She said that I must most likely be pregnant despite receiving 2 negative at home tests already and how I need a blood test to confirm next. Then she started telling me that I need to face the consequences of being sexually active & in verbatim ‚Äúthese things happen when you‚Äôre not married‚Äù. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed and wish I never confided in her to begin with. 

I have a history of ED that she is aware of and prior to this have had issues in being incredibly fatigued/loss of appetite/possible anemia, I‚Äôm very underweight (85 lbs) as well. She kept implying that the only explanation is that i‚Äôm pregnant and said every time these blood tests come back they‚Äôre positive (from last patients). While I think it‚Äôs very plausible this could be something else due to my other medical history/problems. My boyfriend and I are incredibly safe and always use a condom and he never cums inside me on top of that. I told her this and she still was saying how you can never be too certain and that I still most definitely will be pregnant.

I was very distressed and started crying. In which she asked ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù, I told her because I‚Äôm scared about my Dads opinion as the blood test will show up on his insurance. She immediately said ‚Äúohh.... you‚Äôre not scared of your Mom‚Äôs opinion?‚Äù. I awkwardly replied that my parents are divorced in which she apologized that they‚Äôre divorced (???). I don‚Äôt even know how bringing up my mother was relevant besides shaming me more.

Are my feelings valid? I cant help but keep crying reflecting on this interaction I just had. I would appreciate it so much if someone replied. I would hope that medical professionals are someone you can confide but that was one of the worst experiences I have ever had.

When I got to the ER my blood pressure had been 170/100 in the ambulance and the EMT told triage that I was in acute condition and needed to be seen right away. Instead I spent three hours in the waiting room crying and sobbing in pain, so much so that other people in the waiting room were asking why I hadn't been seen yet. 

I've just been thinking that it was a busy, and shitty, hospital and they didn't have anywhere to put me so they just made me wait. Nope. Apparently that wasn't the case. 

See the MALE doctor that evaluated me in triage, that the EMT actually SPOKE to, wrote down on my evaluation notes that I was 'mildly uncomfortable' and that I 'did not appear to be in acute distress'. 

MILDLY UNCOMFORTBLE. MILDLY FUCKING UNCOMFORTABLE. 

Are you god damned fucking kidding me? I NEARLY FUCKING DIED BECAUSE A MALE DOCTOR THOUGHT THAT MY TEARS AND SOBBING AND BLOOD PRESSURE AS HIGH AS SNOOP DOGG WERE SIGNS OF ME BEING MILDLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

Today she met with a new customer to discuss a big project. Project management sent a male project manager (Hicks). 

It started perfectly with Customer asking Ripley for coffee. He's informed about her status and mutters something like an apology. He is visibly unhappy. 

He then proceeds to ask Hicks technical questions despite having been told that Ripley will answer all the technical stuff. Ripley tries to answer questions. Customer ignores Ripley and continues talking to Hicks.

Hicks tells him politely that Ripley is the one to talk to, since he is not a dev and unable to help him. Ripley tries again to explain stuff. 

Customer gets angry and demands another developer, since Ripley is ""obviously far too young for a project of this complexity"". Ripley rolls her eyes and leaves. Not the first time this happens.

Hicks smoothes the waves and tells the customer that the senior lead developer will personally answer all his questions. Customer is satisfied. 

I walk in and calmly introduce myself. 

The customer - now far less satisfied - was forced to discuss all his questions with yours truly, the 47 year old female IT nerd. I was very professional, friendly, and businesslike, he was visibly uncomfortable and irritated by the situation.

THEY SEE IT ALL.

These kids are social media savvy.  They know what's being posted, and it is damn well affecting their mental health. 

I've spoken with so many kids who hear their parents complaining about being parents frequently. Who tell me that their parent can't help them with a reading task without a glass of wine. Kids who tell me that their parents are always frustrated with them. Kids who firmly believe that their parents don't like them. That they're annoying, a pain, bothersome. These comments are driving your kids away from you. They're exasperating your kids mental health. These comments/posts/overheard conversations are making your kids anxious about asking anything of you. These comments, even just in passing, are making a lot of kids feel worthless.

Think about that for a moment. A 12 year old, who sees their parents posting online about needing wine to help them supervise homework time. Who hears parents talking about how the kids are bothersome. A 12 year who feels worthless because they truly believe their parents don't like them, that if they were somehow better, maybe their family would spend time together more often.

I get it. You're busy, things are rough, work is hard, etc. Life is hard. Especially in a pandemic with an uncertain political climate, economy, and household financial situation. But your kids need you. They need to know you're there to support them. They need to know that no matter what, you've got their back. That you want them around. That you *like* them. Your kids are channeling all the stress we, as adults, are too, but they don't have the coping skills to really deal with it yet. They need extra love and care. They need extra reassurance. They need all the positives that come from family and support. If they don't find it at home, they'll start looking in other places for it.

Please spend some actual quality time with your kids, not just being in the same room. Please stop complaining about them in places they can overhear/read. Please be there for them. They need you.

Also, this isn't one or two kids, this is dozens over the months through the spring and so far this fall. Your kids need more support than ever right now. They need you and your love for them. They need to feel it, see it, and believe it.

P.S. I'm not saying you can't, or shouldn't, have adult conversations, be honest, and get support from your adult friends, you definitely should. Just not in public spaces accessible by your children. They hear/see it all. And it affects them. A lot.",TwoXChromosomes

We went on our first date on Thursday. We spent like 4-5 hours together, getting to know each other and such. Those 4-5 hours were great!

We then went to a resturant later in the day and when I got my drinks (water and a pink lemonade), I needed to go use the bathroom. But I didn't trust him enough to leave my drink unattended (because duh, it was our first time meeting). I tried to cover it with my cloth napkin but obviously - that wouldn't stop him if he tried to drug me. ü§£

I said how I'd just wait until I get home to use the bathroom (since the resturant was only a few minutes away from my house). When our waiter came back to us, my date proceeded to say to the waiter:

""Hey, it's our first date. Can you take her drinks and hold them while she goes to the bathroom and bring them back when she gets back?""

WHEN I TELL YOU IN MY HEAD MY JAW DROPPED!!!! I have NEVER had a guy do that for me before or I've never heard of any guy doing that with any woman before! I know some of you are probably thinking ""That's the bare minimum"". Well, he went out of his way to ask the waiter to HOLD MY DRINKS to assure me that I would be safe with him. That was amazing to me personally.

We had a great date and had another one tonight (Saturday). Looking forward to see where things go with him. üòä

My friend seemed to enjoy the guy and started talking to him. They were talking for like 10 minutes all while the guy was pretending I didn't exist and wasn't sitting with them. He didn't even greet me and only interacted with my friend. He kept flirting with her and giving her compliments while I had to pretend nothing was going on and sit there awkwardly.

To reply:

1. How they found it. A 25 year old female radiologist was giving me a sonogram on my kidneys that I asked my doctor to order because I have a 'significant' amount of blood in my urine. (He thought I didn't know when I got my period. I am 47 motherfucking years old, for the love of fuck.) She was half way through and when I flinched she said, ""That shouldn't hurt"" and called the doctor and asked for an order to run another test, which turned into another and another.  She did this while was I in the room, which I know isn't common and she also kept apologizing and saying, ""I am not a doctor, but..."". I am going to buy her a house.
2. How I got the doctor to listen: I found that I had to do a very manipulative dance of humor,  self deprecation and firm forcefulness.  I stopped using phrases like: I don't know, maybe I was wrong, I don't remember exactly.  I had to state things very clearly and not wobble when I was doubted. When the doctor asked my if my feet ever get over-heated at night, I said, ""Yes"", he asked me I took the covers off to cool them down. I just looked at him until he realized that it was really stupid question. I have had blood in my urine with every doctor I saw. I had to manipulate the fourth into ordering the test for me.

1574544430.0,How an older man saved me from a creep without me saying a word.,"So at my job there were loaders who put boxes on the table, and then people like me who took the boxes and put them in a different box. 

I was looking for someone (apartment things) and a guy immediately came up to me. 

Him: Are you looking for your boyfriend? 

Me:No.

Him: Oh does that mean you don't have a boyfriend? 

Me: I don't see how it's any of your business. 

Him:Well, if you don't have one, my cousin is looking for a girlfriend. Can I have your number? 

Me: No. 

Him: Oh come on! He's a really nice guy and really wants a girlfriend. Why not date him since you don't have a boyfriend. 

Me: I'm not giving you my number and I'm not dating anyone I haven't met. 

Him: Do you want to meet him? 

Me: NO! 

Him: *trying to make me feel bad* Oh I guess I'll just shut up now since you don't wanna talk to me. 

Me : Fine. Do whatever you want

Him:""*Opens his mouth*

When suddenly, SLAM! This old guy slams a box between us and moves between us.

1648132223.0,My daughter‚Äôs school potentially humiliated her in front of her class.,"So my daughter is in 4th grade and is 10 years old. She got to school yesterday and started to feel sick. She realized by 9am and was just entering music class. She asked her teacher if she could go to the bathroom and the teacher replied with no, because she should have gone before she even got to her classroom. So my daughter went and sat back down. A couple minutes in and she realized she was going to vomit.. so she asked the teacher again and told her she was going to throw up. This teacher told her to take the trash can in the hallway. My daughter proceeded to throw up and have a bowel movement at the exact same time right outside the classroom in a hallway where the kids in her class could hear and see. 

I‚Äôm livid, do I have a right to be? 

Here are my reasonings for feeling this way:

-Making a young child go into a hallway right outside the classroom with a trash can violates her privacy at the very least. Kids at this age are mean and could hear or see anything happening. Allowing them to bully her for the rest of the time in school for something that she could not control. 

-Girls at this age in particular should not feel ashamed or scared to ask to go to the bathroom in lieu of life changes. What if she had started or something? Does she need to announce it to leave or are you just going to allow her to bleed through her pants? 

-We now live in a brand new normal with Covid fading out, but one of the biggest symptoms being vomiting or nausea. 

I don‚Äôt know what to think or say, all I know is watching my daughter cry in the car sitting next to me over something she had no control over made my blood boil. What would you all do in my situation? If I decide to call the school, is there any advice you could give me for what to say or how to react? I don‚Äôt want to make her time harder or more embarrassing but I also want to stand up and protect my child. Help please.

Edit: I just want to say thank you for all the replies and advice here. I especially want to thank all of the teachers for commenting on guidelines and school policies that I wouldn‚Äôt have had a clue about before. That definitely educated me. I did contact the school earlier to set up a phone meeting with the principal but have heard nothing back at this time. I have written many questions and statements directly from you all regarding what happened so that I can remain calm but clearly get my point across about how upset I am by either policies or judgement or both. 

My daughter is at home today and still kind of physically exhausted from a stomach bug going around. She has eaten more today and stayed hydrated and is on the mend, so thank you to everyone who offered kindness. She and I will have a talk later about this more in depth. And how she has the right to use the bathroom, especially in emergency situations. That‚Äôs been such a big take away from all of you.",TwoXChromosomes

1553000088.0,I took a shower last night without telling/asking my husband first. It was GREAT,"You might be thinking wtf? Why would a grown woman need to ask or tell anyone that she's taking a shower? That's ridiculous! Well, you are correct. But that doesn't change the fucked up dynamic between me and my husband when it comes to childcare expectations. I have a vag, therefore I am 100% responsible for the kids. At all times. Even when I was working full time, which I was until I had my daughter. 

I had a baby 5 weeks ago and my life is currently a blur of feeding baby, changing baby, snuggling baby, sleeping for a few hours at a time, trying to sneak in a few charmed episodes or catching up on my dvr shows, and repeat. And then when my 5 year old who has adhd and is newly medicated gets home from school, I have to add his needs on top of that.

 It's not easy, but it's worth it. That's my mantra. One day you'll probably find me rocking back and forth in the corner, repeating that phrase.. but anyway, my husband goes to work at 630 ish and gets done at 430 ish. I'm guessing a bit because he doesn't actually get home from work until 10 or 11. 

He will go do side projects or visit his friend or his crazy mother. He pretty much does whatever he wants. And even the side projects aren't helping us as a family, because I still pay my part of the bills and provide everything for the kids, so it's not like he's doing them for us. 

The point is, I am a mom 24/7 and it has been difficult to do basic things like eat or shower, because I have a newborn. My husband helped with the baby for the first week while I was recovering from my c section, but nothing since. He doesn't even hold her most nights. He sucks, but that's a whole different story that I'm trying not to get into right now. He will sit on the couch and watch tv while I'm cleaning or cooking and if the baby starts crying, he will at most, say a few things to her from across the living room, like ""awwe dont cry baby girl"" while I have to actually stop what I'm doing and help her. 

Last night after he got home, I went in my room and got some pajamas to change into. I needed a shower, but he was making some food in the kitchen, so I knew he'd get pissy if I asked him to watch the baby. So, I was just gonna go into the bathroom and change my clothes. When I got in there, I got mad. I was thinking, fuck this! She's his daughter as much as she is mine. He has never once asked me to watch her while he showers. Why should I have to ask him to watch his own child? So what if he's cooking? If I didn't do anything else while caring for the baby, I would have starved to death and been a stinky mess still wearing my hospital clothes. 

And so, I took a damn shower! And I wasn't quick about it either. I had to stop myself from rushing because Idk why. It was just this instinct. But I took the shower to make a point. Parenting is not just my responsibility because I'm the mom. Yes Im on leave from work to be with the baby, but that doesn't mean I don't need help sometimes. I feel like a single mom and that really sucks. We both created this baby. We both wanted this baby. I can't imagine going a whole day without seeing or holding her. He sucks as a dad and I'm done just letting him. 

EDIT : apparently this has been locked or something so I can't read/respond to the shit ton of comments that are coming through. I want to address something. My son has been tested, more than once, and by more than one doctor. He absolutely has ADHD and he has a pretty severe case of it. His type is inattentive. He is not super hyper and he's not just a little kid doing little kid things. He literally cannot control his actions and is not capable of stopping and thinking a decision through before he makes it. He has been diagnosed since he was 4. I just put him on medication 2 weeks ago. I was very resistant to meds because of assholes who tried to make me and other parents feel guilty and because of the misinformation that is constantly spread about medication. He didn't turn into a zombie. He didn't lose his personality. He isn't suffering from awful side effects. What he is doing is actually being able to stay with his class all day and go to gym and art and recess. Before, he couldn't make it through the day without several meltdowns and  getting those privileges taken because he couldn't control himself in the less structured activities like gym and recess and art. He is making friends. Something he has been unable to do so far because of his behavior and attention span and him being all over the place constantly. He is proud of himself and how much positive feedback he gets now instead of constantly being told no or being in trouble. He feels good about himself, instead of frustrated and angry at his inability to control his actions. So please stop telling me what I should do with my son. I'm doing exactly what I should be doing.

I get frazzled very easily when driving an unfamiliar route to a new place for the first time and I figured we might get separated by traffic on the way there. Was just trying to be sensible.

I'm following him, but at one point, I follow the google maps instruction to take a turn that this guy doesn't take. He's immediately blowing up my phone.

When I answer and put him on speaker, he asks in this stern voice ""Did you listen to your GPS instead of following me?"". I laughed and admitted that, yeah, sorry, my bad. I ask what his ETA is and, when he tells me the same time as my google maps ETA, I explain we'll just meet up again once we both arrive.

1603556796.0,I was just publicly humiliated at work for not wearing a bra,"Sorry for the title but I‚Äôm really upset about what just happened 

For context, I work at a fast causal dining restaurant. Our uniform is short shorts and a t-shirt. We‚Äôre encouraged to look cute and wear semi-revealing clothing as it is. Ironically, I was actually picked on when I first started for choosing to dress more modestly by wearing tights under my shorts because during the fall and winter it can get cold in the store. 

I am not the only person who regularly does not wear a bra to work. Many of us are girls in our teens and twenties and we‚Äôve never had a customer complaint about any of us looking inappropriate for not wearing one. The t-shirts we wear are not very form fitting and are a thicker cotton blend. I choose to only wear black and grey shirts because it just feels more comfortable to me. I, in my opinion, no way looked provocative or revealing. 

The company I work for is really conservative and I work in a more conservative area, despite marketing as a fun and edgy company. Lots of behaviors like harassment, verbal abuse, racism, etc. often go unpunished until they fear there will be a lawsuit. 

My manager and a back of house worker decided when I came in today that I looked inappropriate even though I wear the exact same outfit multiple times a week. They are friends and have been known to harass people before. In front of the entire staff, my manager says loudly and very sternly ‚ÄúHey, either you go home right now and put a bra on or you‚Äôre not working today. Actually, just go home if you‚Äôre going to act like this‚Äù staring at my chest the whole time. I AM WEARING A TSHIRT AND I AM AN A CUP!!!!! NOT THAT IT SHOULD EVEN MATTER. BOOBS ARE NORMAL.

As of Saturday morning my husband started slurring and acting like he was under water. His movements are slow and he's erratic and I honestly thought he was on some kind of prescription drugs + alcohol. His thoughts are clear, just slowed down. When I first heard it Saturday afternoon I thought he was just lying about how much he'd had to drink by about 7 shots. But his eyes were clear. So when Sunday came around, I figured it'd go away, but he was still slurring. 12 hours after coming home and sleeping so there was no way he'd drank anymore. I asked him to go to the ER with me. And he refused. He said he'd go on Wednesday. 

It's been really freaking me out, so this morning I finally called 9-1-1. They came and tested him and his vitals are fine, he hadn't had a stroke like I'd thought. But they said he should go in to have a neurological test. He refused to go, and they can't force him.

So when they finally left, he told me that we were finished. And that either I start packing or he will but we're done. As I was getting in the shower he told me that he was leaving and he'd be packed and gone by the time I got home from work.

I guess I just needed to vent that. I'm at work and barely holding it together. My heart is broken and we still don't know what's wrong with him. I can't do anything but distract myself and try not to cry. 

Edit: He just sent me a text asking if I want the apartment. I'm crushed.

1549427110.0,I'm pretty sure I got stealthed and I feel disgusted,"I had met this guy from Tinder and we hooked up already once (with a condom) before this happened and he seemed trustworthy enough after that. After the first time we had sex he kept pestering me about how much ""better"" it feels to have sex without a condom, trying to convince me that the pull out method is reliable and that he's ""good at it."" I told him no, that I refuse to have sex without a condom because of the risk of STI's and pregnancy especially because I am not on birth control can't be for various medical reasons. He kept trying to convince me otherwise and it was almost like he was trying to make me feel stupid and inexperienced for ""thinking"" that the pull out method isn't reliable (even though it is an objective fact that it's very unsafe). Eventually, he agreed to keep using condoms and we moved on.

&#x200B;

Honestly, after that conversation, I should have never spoken to this guy again. 

&#x200B;

The next time he came over we started making out doing all the usual foreplay stuff and I was feeling decently comfortable with the whole situation. When it came time to have sex, he put a condom on and it was all fine and good. I started feeling a bit off when I was on top of him in reverse cowgirl (or whatever it's called) and he started trying to finger my butt without asking. I told him to stop and he stopped, which was fine I guess, but I honestly wasn't that amused. We kept going after that, but when he was about to come I was in a position where I couldn't really see what was going on down there and then before I knew it he was coming on my chest with no condom on and was acting like he didn't know where it went. It sounded like he was reading a script. ""Oh my god, where the condom go. I don't know what happened... blah blah blah"" as he haphazardly looked around for the condom. I did NOT consent to have sex without a condom. In fact, I EXPLICITLY stated on multiple occasions that I REFUSE to have sex without a condom, and he STILL did that.

&#x200B;

I was so stunned in that moment and my immediate thought was ""oh my god, he does this to girls all the time doesn't he."" I didn't believe for a SECOND that it was an accident. Condoms don't just slip off like that, and it was ESPECIALLY suspicious that he came on my chest. He had to have known that the condom wasn't on in order to do that, and who even knows how long he was going without it on. I felt so gross as I was cleaning myself up, just dreading the inevitable doctor's appointments and thinking about taking Plan B. I barely said anything to him, and I was scared to say anything because I didn't feel like having him to try to gaslight me into questioning the reality of the situation, or tell me that ""it's not a big deal"" because CLEARLY he has never stopped for even a split second to think about it from the woman's perspective. He hung out for another hour afterward much to my displeasure and I was angry, scared, and on the verge of tears the whole time. 

&#x200B;

I just can't believe that there are people out there that have such little regard for others and I feel so disgusted. Nobody deserves to have their bodily autonomy and consent violated like that.

I just wanted to vent because it has felt pretty shitty having people ask me how my weekend was and saying that it was ""fine"" even though I was dealing with this bullshit because I just don't feel like explaining what happened and I don't want to be judged for my poor decision making even though I never do stuff like this.

1692037421.0,Shopping with my 14-year-old niece yesterday was both sobering and terrifying.,"I'll preface this by saying I'm childfree by choice but I've known my niece since she was four days old and have always thought of her as my non-bio kid. She's entering her teenage goth era and I love that for her as she is way cooler that I was at 14. But she also *looks* young, definitely not one of those teenagers that could pass for 20. There's no judgement with that at all, just a relevant observation for the upcoming saga. 

&#x200B;

When I say goth era, I mean the early 2000's plaid skirt/black sweater combo. Paired with Barbie crocs because she's awesome. While we were walking around, I started to notice there were a few men, I mean *well* into their forties, who would look at her and just...keep looking. I tend to be hypervigilant based on my own experiences anyways, but this was definitely new territory. Then it kept happening. Again and again. I saw no less than ten men who could have been her grandfather staring at her with a look that made me sick to my stomach. If you've seen it, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

A little content warning here because this is when it really felt like a disgusting dive into predator behavior. She found this lime green leopard print thong and held it up laughing because 14-year-old humor. A man who was much older said ""Hey, you'd sure look cute in that."" I thought I was going to knock him out on the spot. I said ""Excuse me?"" at full-volume and he just laughed and walked away. All of this was in the course of a few short hours. I know I was oblivious to that sort of attention as a kid but witnessing it was so horrifying and just so *blatant*. What the hell is wrong with men? I know that's a gross generalization, but honestly I don't know how else to describe it. It makes me terrified for young girls and teenagers in general. Ugh. I need to hide under a rock for a bit -\_-

1593222751.0,Some struggles of being a women without a vagina or uterus,"http://imgur.com/a/ngfynk7 
*Posting this on a throwaway for obvious reasons*

  This post will probably be a little all over. At the age of 15 I was diagnosed with MRKH. It is a condition where mullerian tissue, the stuff that makes the vaginal canal and uterus, doesn't form. Above is a diagram of what my anatomy would look like. I still have xx chromosomes, ovaries, labia, and a normal hormonal cycle. However I do not have a period, and can't get pregnant. Most girls with MRKH don't even find out untill 16ish area when they don't start their period, because from the outside they look completely normal. It is believed 1 in 4,500 girls have it in other words it isn't as rare as you may think.  

Sexism has made this diagnosis all the harder. Living in a world where a large portion of a womans worth is attributed to body parts I do not have, and things (ie pregnacy, and penetrative sex) I can not do is really hard to deal with. 

 Then there is menstration. I ofcourse feel lucky not to have to go through the pain of periods, but at the same time having them is so heavily equated with ""becoming a woman"" that I feel like a fraud calling myself one.

 It even effects my healthcare. Doctors immediately focus on treatment options to make sure girls can ""satisfy your future husband"", and in some countries girls are denied vaginal lengthening treatment until they have a man to marry. 

 It isn't all bleak as there are some doctors that have worked on pionereering uterine transplants which is amazing. However, I will say after watching a women born without a womb have her own baby it really made me wonder why with all this advancement there is still no psychological component to treatment, and why there is so little research on if making vaginal canals really provides sexual pleasure. 

 At the vulnerable age of 15 I was pushed to modify my body for the pleasure of a man I had never met, but never once did any doctor mention whether or not the treatment options would provide myself any pleasure. Never once did a doctor ask if I even wanted to pursue the painful process of vaginal lengthening. 

After my one and only specialist visit I was given hard plastic dilators and told to use them twice a day for the rest of my life as if that was supposed to fix the tremendous void in my life. I took my small vaginal dimple and over time stretched it to a length where I can have penetrative sex, but it was a painful process and sex is still really hard. 

 I have often been shushed into silence, because sexual anatomy is taboo. However, I feel like if people could learn about the diverse body types the world would be a better place, and in the case of MRKH there is a lot to learn in terms of the sexism some think no longer exists. Thanks for reading.

When we (I and C) went back down the stairs there were a girl and a boy, both a little drunk) at the door of another apartment. I felt that something was off and asked the girl if everything was alright. The boy didn't let her speak and answered right away that everything was good and they had an arrangement, he was sleeping there. I stopped him and said that I was interested in what the girl had to say. I asked her if she wanted him to sleep there/with her. She said no. So I told the guy well let's go away we will help you to get back home. C backed me up, the guy was reluctant but I once again interrupted him, and told the girl that we were going to take care of him and she could go in her apartment and to sleep well. She looked at me with big eyes, kissed me on the cheeks and said ""you were awesome, thank you"" and closed her door. We brought the guy downstairs, he kept telling us that he wasn't that kind of person, that it was a misunderstanding, that she led him on etc. I just nodded. He left, and C and I went back to our party.

I feel so relieved that nothing happened to her. I'm glad C had my back. I'm angry at that a-hole. And I still feel a bit overwhelmed.

I told him this happens to nearly every woman sometimes multiple occasions. He couldnt believe it so i told him about the time i worked in an office and my job was to manage the on road reps, their schedules, their expenses etc .
One rep was awful, he had a serious disrespect toward women .He came from a culture where u were only good for babies and basically servitude, he made this quite clear to me the 1st time he met me.

I brought this up to my bosses on numerous occasions but they dismissed my concerns, they were also men, not sure that matters but hey.

Anyhu this rep is out on the road and they have to take pics of the shops the visit and send them back so we used a drop box account. It was my job to look at the pics near the end of the day and place orders for refilling the stands... they all knew this.

He keeps sending me pics of his little johnson im shocked so quickly delete. Next day it happens again , always at the same time when im the last one in the office, so now i get upset like he HAS to know. 

The next day i say it to my bosses and show them the evidence , he is called in for a chat and he walks to my desk smiles at me and says ooo sorryyyyy .

Next day, yup u guessed it, happens again... except this time i ""accidently"" put it in the wrong folder being so upset and all and this folder belongs to a client , a client who has access to it.

Next day there is no sign of rep apparently the Male customer was so appalled the rep was fired. However i was just supppsed to get on with it.

Somehow we started discussing the death penalty and then the discussion led to abortion. And then, out of nowhere, my sister turns off the tv, looks at me with a calm and gentle look in her eye and tells me that she had an abortion seven years ago. There is nothing going on in my brain. I look the woman I love the most in my life and the only thing I can ask is ‚Äúwho was the father, Luke (name changed)?‚Äù.  Yes, it was her then boyfriend. Her workaholic, mean boyfriend who made her feel very bad about herself. Also: ‚ÄúDo mom and dad know?‚Äù Of course not, no. And all I could say was ‚Äúokay‚Äù. And then we continued watching the documentary.

On the way home, I was completely numb. I was out of balance of how I didn‚Äôt feel like I thought I should have felt. The conversation was nothing I ever thought it would be. I had always thought that I would immediately cut out the person who confessed me something so horrifying about themselves. But this was _my sister_.  My sister. The woman who paid for my every single living expense for 8 months when I had a rough patch in life, including a new laptop so I can continue my university work. My sister, who texts me every day funny things and wishes me a happy day. My sister, who literally rocked me in her arms when I was in my lowest point in my eating disorder. And then it hit me. She never told me this. She. never. told. me. this. 

Here's some background: I have been passionately pro-life my whole life. Our family is pro-life. I was one of those girls who posted things on social media and was participating in activism to end abortion. It was something that was so dear to me it was pretty much a part of my identity.

We haven‚Äôt discussed this since that day. I simply can not open the conversation. But since that day, I have changed. The seed was planted in me two years ago when I saw my sister struggle with her pregnancy. But now it bloomed. 

I am happy she had that abortion.

I am happy that today, she has her husband and her son. She would have been miserable, stuck with him. 

And I wanted to justify my thoughts to myself. I wanted to justify them so bad. It was different from other women who have abortions because‚Ä¶ What? He was worse than the other fathers? No. He wasn‚Äôt a drunk, he didn‚Äôt abuse any other substance, he didn‚Äôt beat her, he wasn‚Äôt completely broke. But he wasn‚Äôt a nice person, at all. Would my sister been worse off than the other women I have always thought should just be responsible for their actions? No. She had an education, they would have somehow managed the finances,  she wasn‚Äôt _too_ young. She would definitely had managed to become a mother. Survived.

But here is the only difference... I love her. It wasn‚Äôt meant to be her life, the life she lives nowadays is. And that‚Äôs it. 

I am a hypocrite. 

I am ashamed of the way I have behaved in the past. 

I am glad she didn‚Äôt tell me when I was 16.  I would have behaved like a monster. She knew I wasn‚Äôt mature enough to process it then.  She has been watching the way I have behaved all these years, knowing what she knows, and she has forgiven me for that. I was never there for her, not one of us was, when she was always there for us. She felt so alone she had to do it all by herself. And now she trusted me with this. And I am so grateful for that.

All I want to say is: I am so sorry.

The professor in question is a very well-dressed woman, always wearing makeup and heels, sometimes wearing skinny pants and the like.  Her clothes are never revealing‚ÄîI know this because I have paid attention to her clothing every lecture since this encounter.

A woman can *literally* be intelligent enough to gain a tenured research position in the country‚Äôs top university, but if she looks good, *it doesn‚Äôt fucking matter*.  Because the thing is, I would probably dress similarly to her, in her place.  I pride myself on feeling good with how I look and choosing a cute wardrobe.

Please reassure me that my entire STEM career won‚Äôt be like this.

A female researcher must be twice as smart, but if she dresses well, she‚Äôs distracting and unprofessional‚Äîand not taken as seriously‚Äî and if she dresses ugly, then that is commented on as well.

There is way too much compassion for men that say and do things that are intolerable.  A healthy society reinforces consequences for intolerable actions.  A society where judging a formidably intelligent woman by her dress is tolerable, has a problem.  So if we want to progress, we politely explain why that is not okay.  And I explain with a smile because I‚Äôm compassionate.  Because they‚Äôre my friends.  And god knows I‚Äôve had to explain these things hundreds of times.  But you know what?

1610164657.0,A strange tactic I used to stave off an attempted rape,"I‚Äôve been thinking about an incident that happened to me a few years ago, and what it says about male psychology when it comes to rape.

I was living and working in Dubai at the time. It was 1am and I had decided to leave the club before all my friends because I was drunk and tired. I waited outside for a while, trying and failing to find a taxi. A man was standing at the entrance smoking, observing my struggle. After a while he comes up to me, strikes up a conversation ‚Äì he‚Äôs my age, clean-cut, very polite and friendly. We chat for a while, and then he mentions he lives in my neighborhood and he‚Äôd be happy to give me a ride. Stupidly, I agree.

Shortly after getting in the car with him, he reaches for my hand and starts holding it. Afraid of angering this strange man I suddenly realize was a bad idea to accept a ride from, I let him. He unzips his fly and puts my hand on his dick. Still scared, I let him. He starts jerking himself off with my hand. He pulls over and comes over to the passenger side of the seat.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do this,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúPlease just let me out of the car.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you want this,‚Äù he said. He‚Äôs now standing on top of me, unzipping his fly.

‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet me go.‚Äù

He starts kissing me. I pull away. He‚Äôs trying to spread my legs.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this!‚Äù I say louder.

‚ÄúShut up, you want to do this.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. This is rape. You are about to rape me. You are a rapist.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a rapist.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes you are. You are raping me right now. This is rape.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is not rape! You want this!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre raping me right now. Rapist! Rapist! Rapist!‚Äù I start shouting hysterically.

""Stop saying that!"" he shouts. ""Wallah, I'm a good Muslim man, I would never rape a woman.""

Finally he pulls away. I jump out of the car and start walking away rapidly. He drives off. I‚Äôm now in the middle of nowhere, phone is dead, no taxi in sight, but hey, at least I haven‚Äôt been raped. It takes me several hours to find my way home, crying the whole time.

I‚Äôve always found this story kind of interesting because of what it says about how certain men perceive non-consensual sexual experiences. I‚Äôm sure if I hadn‚Äôt said what I said, the next day he‚Äôd be bragging to everyone he got laid and the woman loved it, she was begging for me. I think men, especially when drunk, can get blinded by lust; they want it so bad and they don‚Äôt understand how we could not want it. Actually telling them that what they are doing is rape can maybe wake them up to the severity of the act they are about to commit ‚Äì not in all cases, of course. But maybe sometimes.

Just wanted to share in case this ever helps someone get out of a similar situation.

*Edit:* I'm not able to respond to all your messages, but I want to say I really appreciate the outpouring of support, and the experiences everyone has shared. It seems this is a sickeningly common situation, and I'm sorry for the pain and fear so many of you have gone through.

Quite a few women have shared stories where they used this exact tactic and it worked, so I really think we should add this to our arsenal of protective strategies against sexual assault. Sad that we live in a world where this is necessary.

To the people telling me it was my fault for getting in the car with a strange man - I know that was an incredibly stupid thing to do and am not justifying it, but that doesn't mean I deserved to be raped. 

Have also received several dms saying that I jerked him off, I was a tease and I wanted it. Did you miss the part where he took my hand and moved it for me? Even if I had done that of my own volition, the moment I withdraw my consent it becomes rape.

1553038667.0,Genital hygiene really should be taught in Sex Ed,"I'm a millenial from the UK so I've had a comparatively good sex education, but absolutely none of it covered looking after your genitals, only the inner workings of things. At 10 they made us watch a woman give birth, but apparently telling us at 16 to pee after sex was too graphic/not suitable?

As an adult, I have had countless friends get yeast infections because they didn't use the correct soap, and who thought it was normal to deal with excessive smegma, or who didn't realise that they had to clean UNDER the foreskin - I myself have even had to look up what lumps/bumps are ""normal"" as I was scared there might be something wrong.

Anyway, I wanted to get this off of my chest because it seems like a really simple fix to me - rant over.

edit: For those of you saying that its a parental responsibility to teach their kids: I totally understand, but not everyone has the privelage of having genitally savvy parents/parents at all. So I think the best way to reach most is by adding these things to the curriculum at an early enough point that it doesn't become ""awkward"" for any party.

He is ""callous and unemotional"" which is a nice way of saying he's a sociopath who is too young to be diagnosed. I did everything in my power to protect her but he's manipulative as hell and the pediatric mental health care system is in shamble. We would be forced by law to take him back into the house or be charged with abandonment. He always found new ways to hurt and traumatize her.

Several years ago he acted out sexually, she told me immediately and the police got involved. He never came home. He's been bouncing between treatment facilities ever since. The number one thing I hear from our relatives? What's going to happen to Son! What's his future going to be? Not because of the affect on his sister, but because his life is ruined already and he's not even 18 yet. 

Not a word from relatives about what his sister is feeling or what she's planning to do with her life now that she isn't living in constant fear. She's thriving. We thought she had allergic eczema her entire life, it turns out her trigger is stress, without him in the house her skin has completely healed. Her eyelashes grew back. She has friends for the first time in her life. Anybody in my family happy? Nope. All they care about is the tragedy of my son throwing away his life.

To people who asked how it turned out like this he grew up in a two parent household, no violence or drinking. He was a difficult toddler, we didn't bond well and that's on me. He had a speech delay that caused him frustration. He resented her from infancy because of her crying. We thought it was the normal sibling rivalry but it got serious. 

He destroyed anything she showed an interest in. He would slap her or just attack her for no reason. I never left them alone together but he still managed to hurt her. She was too afraid to sleep in her bedroom because she thought he might sneak in, lock the door and kill her in her sleep. He threatened to. He tried to trigger her food allergies to see what would happen. Every single therapy we've tried he does the absolute minimum. He doesn't care.

I'm 25 now and that still hasn't changed. I've heard it all from people - you'll change your mind when you get older, your husband will want kids, you're not doing your ""womanly duty"" if you don't have kids, you're selfish. 

However this past weekend was my worst experience with this. I ended up in the ER, and the doctor came in and asked if I had children (it was related to why I was there). When I said no, he went off about how when he was my age he thought the same thing but as he got older, he got wiser and realized that his life would never truly be fulfilled until he had children. He told me that if I wanted to enrich my life I should go ahead and just start having children now and make my life better earlier instead of waiting until I'm older. Y'all, I was livid. I was in the ER, in excruciating pain, and all I wanted was to feel better. What I got was this jackass shaming me for my life choices instead of spending his time helping me with what I was there for.

(yay!!) Which means that I went through the inspections and contractors on my own. By the time all the inspections were completed, I knew what needed to be replaced, why it needed to be replaced, and what kind of budget and time frame I was looking at.

My realtor had recommended a contractor that typically does good work. The guy supposedly came out to the property and wrote up an estimate. All was well! The sellers provided the money needed to complete these repairs based on his estimate.

Once I closed on the home I called to schedule the contractor to come out and complete the work. We spent about 10 minutes going through the itemized estimate to decide what needed to be completed sooner rather than later. At the end of the call he said ""so, do you have a spouse or someone I can talk to when I get to the house?"" As if I was unable to discuss the home repairs with him or the work that was being performed. Um.. what?! No.. no you don't. It's just me, but thanks. I'm the one that called to talk to you for a reason... but I guess that doesn't matter!

Anyways, he is no longer doing the repairs to my house. Also, I found a way better contractor and passed on his information to my realtor. My realtor will no longer be recommending him for home repairs. So in the end, it was a win/win, but man I hate being talked to like an idiot for no other reason than being a woman! End rant.

I felt inside me I wasn't okay and decided to stop by the emergency room and see if they could take me more seriously. Well after waiting a few hours this male doctor walks in and took every word I said seriously and actually gave me a physical exam where he discovered a piece of tampon had fallen off. He then tells me I was beginning to feel the effects of toxic shock syndrome. I told him what the other doctor had said to me and he replied that had I waited even two days it could have been fatal.

Ectopic pregnancies typically cause your internals to rupture between 6-8 weeks. 

So basically they‚Äôve just told me I won‚Äôt get treatment until my tubes rupture, I begin bleeding out and have to be driven to an ER asap before my body goes into shock and I literally die from bleeding out.  There they will have to do surgery to remove whatever internals have ruptured and possibly one or both of my fallopian tubes. 

This is a simple procedure right now. I know the exact dosage and treatment I need yet the state of Oklahoma would rather see women like me on the verge of bleeding out rather than administering treatment in a safe and timely manner.

He was sober and the DD, taking me home. After quite a few more than just liquid courage I asked him to come over, and he said no. I was a little hurt at first even though he's a very close friend, I felt silly. He brought me home, kissed me goodnight and I told him I wanted a raincheck which he quickly agreed to. 

Once I got into bed I had a text from him. He said even though he knew it's what I wanted, he didn't feel right having sex with someone who was drunk.  He said we could do it another time when we were both sober. And it really meant so so much to me. It was so sweet. If I had ever suggested that in the past with other partners it would have ended badly. He thought I was being a little bitter about it but I told him I respected it,so much. 

It's so small but I've never had this option in front of me before and I wanted to cry. He said he didn't trust consent from someone drunk and I could make my decisions sober. It's sad that this had such an impact, I guess but it means so much

1) I don't drink very much this isn't normal for me. I had a hand full of beers on an empty stomach, and I don't owe you guys much more explanation on my alcohol tolerance. 
2) someone said if I needed liquid courage to have sex I didn't actually want to.

1693132599.0,I was screamed at by some right wing psycho in Costco yesterday while waiting for ice cream with my five year old.,"There were probably 30 people waiting for food because Saturday Costco is bananas but my son really wanted to try the new strawberry ice cream they have here. I figured no big anyways since my husband offered to deal with the check out line. We ordered and walked off to the side next to some white boomer dude and his wife. 

It's Texas so of course we start up a conversation in line. I mentioned how rough it must be to work there since it looked like all of five people were getting the food out. This somehow visibly pissed him off and he started in on how a job is a job. I probably should have left it, but I decided to just casually say some jobs are a lot tougher than others. His next words exactly were ""just like a fucking Democrat"" and I said something like really dude? It was over at that point. 

He went fucking nuts. He started screaming at me to go back to California? I picked up my son and said I was a Texan, born and bred, but that I thought it was time to leave it at agree to disagree because he was becoming aggressive. **I walked to the other side of the counter with my son** and he is yelling the entire time. I'm standing there in a group of strangers and the guy is just going off on me while my son is clutching me and clearly terrified. 

Then I did it friends, I turned to look at him and I said you look as stupid as you sound or something to that effect and this one statement back was enough to make him push his cart over to his wife and stomp past me, **literally knocking into my shoulder**, just to let me know he could hurt me if he wanted. 

I'm on the verge of tears and I go find my husband and tell him what happened. My husband tells me the point him out and he walks over ready to murder the guy. Wouldn't you know it, all of a sudden now that a man is involved the guy has a visible tail between his legs look. He just starts saying ""No disrespect"" over and over like as though that fucking means anything. He wouldn't even look at me. I asked why he was apologizing to my husband for screaming at me and he still just kept talking to my husband. It made me feel so fucking small and weak.

I don't know what I even want from this post except to cry about the fact that I can't even feel safe getting ice cream at fucking Costco anymore. I feel like I can't go anywhere without my husband. This is the worst one, but it's not the first time a guy has made me feel unsafe with my kids in tow. The last few years have been horrendous. There's nothing more jarring than the moment when you don't know how to protect your child from a stranger. I'm just scared and angry. Why the fuck are people like this?

Edit: I think it's important to note that I couldn't even find a manager because they were so busy. And this is Texas, I wanted out of there before the guy had time to get to his I'm sure oversized truck and grab a gun. I just wanted to go home, and I think a lot of y'all would have felt the same way in the situation. I also do carry pepper spray but I definitely couldn't have used it here.

It‚Äôs information THEY provide on an online social media platform.** And even so- the point isn‚Äôt to harass teens or threaten kids, it‚Äôs to let the school know these kids are cyber bullies.

\- old man: well it goes for him too, and for you

\- me: no it does not.  She, correctly, said it was a bison.  He argued it was a buffalo.  She argued back that it was a bison, and then he accused her of being argumentative when he baited her into the argument and was being argumentative himself.  And then you walked up to her and gave her the awful advice that she needs to let him have this or else, presumably, lose him. 

\- another woman behind me pushing a double stroller: because god forbid she corrects him when he's being an idiot. \*turns to girl\* honey, you should consider leaving, he's not respecting your time or your joy.  It won't get better. 

\- old man: I didn't mean to make this a woman thing.

The other woman, the young girl, and I all silently agree to ignore him and the woman behind me loudly said to her kids ""look at that BISON"" which the young girl also loudly added while grinning ear to ear ""oh they have BISON in this enclosure? Is this the BISON exhibit?""

1685972051.0,This is why many women don't feel safe using rideshare services. After a serious safety incident where my Lyft driver refused to pick me up unless I gave him my personal phone number and email (leaving me alone in a high crime area at night) Lyft ignored me saying I wasn't safe and refused to refund,"I prebooked a driver on Lyft, because I was in an unsafe part of the city, staying with a friend who had to dodge stray bullets while walking the dog at 2pm just two weeks ago. I get my suitcases downstairs, driver is nearby, so I go outside, closing the door behind me. (I don't have a key and my friend is asleep) Suddenly the driver starts texting me repeatedly asking for my personal phone number and email, saying he needs it because there is ""an update"". This is obviously completely wrong, there is no reason for the driver to get this info. A criminal scam at best, a dangerous safety situation at worst since he knows from my picture that I'm a woman.

I refuse. He refuses to come my way and keeps asking. Obviously at this point I have to cancel the ride. $5 charge!!

I contact their safety team to report this. They ask if I'm safe. I say NO, actually I'm not safe. It's night time, I'm standing in a high crime area, alone, and now this creep knows exactly where I am standing, without a ride, having just canceled on him...

They respond with : ""Great, I'm glad you're safe!"" ????

And then refuse to refund me.... Best they can do is unpair me so I won't get this driver again. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.

**Edit: Half a million views on reddit already. Enjoy the bad publicity $5 bought you, Lyft execs!**

Edit 2: The $5 has been refunded with a rather vague, evasive apology that doesn't really take responsibility:

""Thank you for your patience. You were charged a cancellation fee, we apologize for any confusion previously. We understand that you were being asked for personal information, and please know, Lyft will only ever request personal information using:

Phone number: 855-529-5676
SMS text number: 61416

We refunded the $5 cancelation fee. This may take 5-7 business days for your bank to process.

We thank you for contacting us today and for being a valued part of the Lyft community, it was our pleasure assisting you with your cancellation, and if you have any other questions, please reach out.""

We are getting better at delegating tasks evenly between ourselves. I didn't work all summer so I did pretty much everything. Now that my full time job started we've been having a lot of conversations about more evenly distributing housework and putting it into practice.

I expect him to pull his weight and he does too, but that doesn't mean we don't thank each other for it.

While I was in the shower my husband came into the bathroom hoping I would stop showering and start making dinner. Yes, really. Our conversation went like this‚Ä¶

Husband: Are you okay?

H: I was wanting to know if you want to eat dinner.
Me: (still showering) Like, right this minute? 
H: No, I just mean some time tonight.

People of Reddit, I have been married to this man for 20 years and I promise in all that time I‚Äôve never needed a welfare check while I am showering. We had the menu planned and groceries bought hours ago (I made a suggestion, he said no and specified another entree).

Just one for the whole night. 

No, he won't.


EDIT :


Fuck you for comparing one dance on NYE to  FUCKING RAPE. I am not a rapist. You guys are insane if you think one dance in a public setting on a NYE party is equivalent to me coercing him into sex or smiling or touching or anything else I've been accused of. 

Also this is not a relationship post, I'm not asking for advice, I was complaining of a situation I KNOW lots of women were in last night : their partners putting their wants before theirs, even for the smallest compromise possible: ONE DANCE (3min) in a party of 6 hours.

Fuck you for saying ""no means no"" in this context, as if it's not totally de-politicizing the motto, as if it's not a huge anti-rape slogan. No will always means no for me in any consent related situation. But ""I don't want to so I won't make an effort"" in an everyday setting will always means I'm disappointed. 

Also, you don't know anything about my relationship or myself. So don't flatter your pathetic selves by assuming because I was disappointed and made ONE (1) reddit post, I am a coercing abusing person. You are jumping to conclusions. 

And to the comments mocking me, yes, I was sad and ""pouting"" for 1 hour because I could not dance with the man I love the most on a special night. Of that, I am guilty, laugh all you want. 

To everyone else, thank you for your comments, they made me feel a little bit better and lot of them were super funny. Love you girls. 

And for those interested, in the end we didn't dance but we made up and I apologized for bringing down the mood when he said no. It wasn't very understanding of me, and he explained he was feeling a bit bloated when I asked and didn't want to tell me at the time (men's secrecy with their digestive system I guess). 

So all is well.

Happy New Year, 2xers! We have decided to make some changes.

New Posting rules:
 
>No memes, rage comics, or image macros.

>>Memes and rage comics are however overwhelmingly accepted at /r/TrollXChromosomes. While still smallish it is growing very quickly and would welcome any and all you that would like to join them.

>~~Images are to be submitted within self-posts only and will be moderated for content.~~

>>Your post must ***contribute substance*** to the subreddit at a level higher than ""Look at my rainbow cake/ engagement ring/ no heat curls/ boyfriend,"" (which are welcome over at /r/2xLookbook). We also have a great list of related subreddits [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/faq#GirlinessandWomanhood)

>Linking to other subreddits to start drama is not allowed.

>>This includes self posts with pics of comments or posts, mentioning  or linking to that horrible subreddit you just saw within comments or posts, blogs that just happen to be talking about that subreddit you hate etc. All will be removed with out warning. Promoting your FABULOUS new subreddit is, of course, always welcome.

>No questions generalizing all people from one group

>>We will no longer allow ""friendzone"" questions or ""Dude here; Why do all women.. Why won't she... Why do females"" posts that blanket categorize people.

>All posts must be focused on women or being a woman.

>>side note to this rule: We're coming into an election year, political posts are going to abound. Posts from major media sources with the bulk of the article focused on a candidates stance on women's issues are allowed. Blogs, self posts about why Johnny Appleseed is the bestest (or worstest) candidate for women, articles that mention abortion in passing, or direct links to donation pages should be posted elsewhere. 

>**Posts found to have an influx from ***any*** group of users may  result in those users banned, en masse, at our discretion.

>>Users who wish to appeal may do so. Consideration will be given to otherwise positive members of 2xc ***regardless*** of other subreddits they are involved in. Throwaway accounts will not be given any consideration.  User history will also be taken into consideration. Differing opinions are welcome, voting and participating in threads as an organized group is not.


ETA: To be clear, we absolutely are not trying to get rid of throwaway accounts used by users with secrets to share or in need of support. I've moved a few sentences to hopefully make that clearer. Throwaway accounts used to troll or participate in a thread in an organized fashion with outsides groups will not be given any consideration when banned. 

Second ETA: We still want silly posts, we still welcome self posts with fun/silly questions, silly articles about whatever affects *your* life are all still welcome! Only if your post has a political slant, you must do it from a woman's perspective.

Basically I'm a father now and the prospect of me being a father to a little girl kind of is exciting and also scary. I never had a sister, or really any girl 'friends' per se. In researching stupid psychology on the internet the whole idea of acting as a man (ie be a dick to your daughter) is generally what a lot of men say to do - especially to their potential boyfriends/friends. That doesn't sound right.

So ladies who have great experiences with your dad please share. Dancing classes, softball, soccer, camping?  And if you didn't have a good dad also please let me why you think that.

I grow from discussion. There's a lot of craptacular books out there I know but the ones I've read just don't speak to me. Plus in so much of my life i've spent winging the details - I don't want to wing/clutch the details of anything related for my daughter. ",TwoXChromosomes

In high school, I met my friend and ended up getting along really well with her family. 5 years later I can hang out and the mom is pretty comfortable with me.

So I have spent the month here, because my friend just had her baby and she wanted someone around to keep her company at home. 
While being here my friends mother was talking about wanting to end her Marrige because she is very unhappy in it. He is emotionally abusive, extremely controlling and,  mooches off of her with no job an does basically nothing around the house outside of telling everyone else what to do and the ""right way"" of doing it. 
The problem is, she is afraid to do it. In the past he had a drinking problem and ended up beating her up pretty bad. He quit drinking and they ended up getting back together. She is stil afraid of him and during some arguments he kind of threatened her, IMO. For example she brought it up in an argument and he said ""that was mostly my fault and partly yours. I was mad and was drinking and you kept giving me mean looks like the one you are giving me now. You only bring this shit up when there are other people in the house, like you are trying to provoke me into hitting you. I only did that cause I had alcohol, I won't hit you. If I had alcohol it might be another story..."" and so on.

She really doesn't want to involve police or anything like that. She is stuck trying to think of a peaceful reason to end things. Recently a pretty shocking thing in his past came up which is pushing her at the edge. Whenever she brings it up he immediately dismisses it. 

TL:DR Friends mom wants to end Marrige, though due to past abuse she is afraid.

I was a little girl, maybe 8 years old, and I was spying on my parents through a crack in my bedroom door, because my dad was sitting on the couch in the living room CRYING. I'd never seen him cry before, but his uncle? had died and he was crying about it. My mother was sitting next to him on the couch and she put her arms around him to comfort him and the motherfucker started to play with her boob. My mother reared back in shock and I shut the door fast because I didn't want to see that shit. 

Fast forward to the rest of my life and literally every man I've attempted to comfort by giving them a hug has tried to make it sexual. Both of my husbands, each man I've dated, and random male friends have also done it. I have rarely met a man who can accept a comforting hug without somehow assuming we want to fuck them. 

So I got wise to this, eventually, and did what many of us are forced to do and I became a cold bitch. Because why would I reach out to a friend with comfort when that's going to happen? 

What prompted all this, including the dream, I think, is that I work with a man who has a progressive disease and he's been missing a lot of days because of it. He was back at work the other day and I stopped at his desk to welcome him back and see how he's doing. As I left I put my hand on his shoulder and wished him a good day. HUGE MISTAKE. This goddam man, 55, sick, obese and sweaty, tried to hit on me later in the day. 

There seems to be nothing that will stop a man from trying to turn simple human kindness into an imaginary come-on if it's from a woman. 

I know that most men are so touch deprived that it seems like a good idea to shoot your shot under such circumstances but what they need to do instead is get over their homophobia and go ask a male friend for a hug. I know other men who have started doing this and non of them turned gay. And if you hug a male friend and he hits on you, well... learn something from it. ",TwoXChromosomes

I talked with my SO this evening. We ended up having an hour long conversation where I told him honestly that I didn't think I could be a parent today-some day in the future (with him hopefully) but now I was not equipped. I asked him for his feelings and he said he felt like I was rejecting a piece of him and abandoning a child-our child. (Which honestly made me feel very guilty. Not guilty enough to justify bringing a child into the world though.)



I told him I felt differently but that his feelings were valid. But I decided to get the abortion because I'm just not ready to be a mother now. I hope to be someday, and I don't want to have a child before I can devote myself entirely to it. He said he sort of understood but still felt as though we were abandoning a child. I apologized to him. 



I asked him again if he could go with me to the clinic because (I know it's selfish) I really want someone I know well with me. He said he'd think about it and get back to me. I made an appointment for next week. 



So I'm not sure where our relationship will go from here. He still hates the idea of abortion but I think he hates it a little less now. I'll have to see how he feels afterwards. 



I'm really glad I made the appointment though because the thought of being a mother scares me even more than him leaving, although that's a really hard choice to make. Thanks to everyone who wrote. I appreciate it. ",TwoXChromosomes

Lately she's been having a rough time with school, friends and boys. There's also been conflict with her parents. I think some of the issues she's encountering are normal for someone her age but there are some other factors at play. She was adopted and has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

She has admitted to ""doing stuff"" with her last boyfriend but says they stopped short of having sex. Now she has a new boyfriend and recently told me (and her mom) that she doesn't understand the big deal about sex and doesn't see many reasons to wait until she's older.

She and I get along well and I feel she values my POV more than that of her parents because she sees me as more relatable (I'm in my mid twenties). She thinks her parents want her to save sex for marriage because they are religious so she discounts anything they tell her. I've tried talking to her about the consequences of having sex but I don't think any of what we discussed will deter her. We talked about pregnancy but she thinks the biggest negative would be getting kicked out of her house (I don't know how realistic that is). I tried talking to her about the emotional impact (what if they have sex and he decides he doesn't want to see her anymore? Could she handle that?). I don't think she has much foresight and I don't know how well she understands the consequences of her actions. 

She's been bullied at school and is very hurt that other girls call her ""slut"" behind her back. We talked about how unfair this double standard is (no one says anything negative about the male party) but it doesn't make this any easier for her to deal with. I'm really worried about the possible implications of her having sex (especially her getting hurt and the bullying getting worse). She doesn't have good coping skills as is and I'd hate to see her go through worse. I'm totally at a loss for what else to say to her from a sex-positive point of view (or am I not being sex-positive by thinking she's too young to have sex?). I welcome any ideas/suggestions.

He's always calling her princess, comparing her to goddesses, and just generally being a bit of a try hard. If I'm understanding it right, they also started dating while he was also dating somebody else, which is when all this princess stuff started.

The way he talks to her is like something out of one of Shakespeare's plays, she gets all giddy and googly eyed whenever he's like that, and it just seems really odd.

The first time we heard anything about him was when he was calling her a goddess, saying that she was more than that, it just screamed player to us. There's a huge timezone difference between them, she's in the US and he's in Norway (I think? Somewhere around there) so they really only talk through texts/Skype, she said that he's ""busy"" for weeks on end and is barely around, too.

Are we being too paranoid? Like I said, she's had some shitty boyfriends, and we really don't want her to get hurt again. I've mentioned it to her, and she went on about how he was perfect, how he was different from other guys, that sort of thing. ",TwoXChromosomes

1661776075.0,"Even If The Transphobia Doesn't Bother You, Please Don't Buy (or Even play) The New Hogwarts Game","Stole the following from FB, and it's a pretty good commentary on why you shouldn't buy, or even play the upcoming JKR Hogwarts game

So let me get this straight. There's a new, very polished video game set in the Wizarding World of committed transphobe JK Rowling. The plot of the game is that there is a rebellion of goblins who are fighting against racial discrimination and prejudice by the Ministry of Magic and the wizarding community as a whole. From the Harry Potter Compendium - ""The Goblin Rebellions were a series of rebellions in which the goblin population of the Wizarding world revolted against discrimination and prejudice toward their kind by wizards and witches. They were most prevalent during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but even in modern times there are subversive goblin groups working in secret against the Ministry of Magic, according to the Daily Prophet. The historical rebellions have been described as ""bloody and vicious."" ...These rebellions may have occurred because of lack of goblin representation [in magical Parliament], attempts to enslave goblins as house-elves, stripping of wand privileges, wizard attempts to control Gringotts, or the brutal goblin slayings by Yardley Platt.""

And you, the hero, are a wizard whose ultimate task it is to quash the rebellion and put these goblins back in their rightful place under the rule of the wizards.

The goblins of the HP series have long been criticized as offensive Jewish stereotypes, with critics pointing out their control of the magical banking system, their greed, and their exaggerated facial features. And the game is set in 1890, around the time the antisemitic hoax ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"" was being developed (published 1903 amidst a new wave of antisemitism in Europe). Part of the official gameplay reveal shows the two villains, Ranrok the goblin (pictured) and Victor Rookwood the dark wizard, discussing what appears to be a child abduction scheme. From a fandom site: ""Ranrok was a very greedy individual who sought to claim a magical power he caught a glimpse of that wizardkind hid even from themselves. His worldview was skewed by his hatred for all wizards and witches, who he sought to destroy entirely.""

The lead designer for Avalanche Games, Troy Leavitt, has been a harsh critic of social justice movements, was a proponent of Gamergate, called the MeToo movement a ""moral panic,"" and claimed that society gives deferential treatment to LGBTQ+, POC, women, and disabled people. And Warner Brothers knew this before they hired him to make this game. This game where the player fights against greedy, child-abducting Jewish stereotypes. The game where the player suppresses an uprising of an oppressed race who are pushing back against their own disenfranchisement, disarmament, slavery, and murder, in order to maintain the supremacy of the dominant culture.

Um...

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS NONSENSE?

Listen, friends. I know a lot of you still love the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. You've got a lot of emotional baggage tied up in whether you're a member of House Braggadocio, House GiftedChild, House SamwiseGamgee, or House EugenicsAreGoodActually. But I beg you, please, don't buy this game. Walk away from both Rowling and the Wizarding World. Don't give Warner Brothers any more money.""

1399523231.0,What it's like as a woman having thin hair [a rant].,"I have thin hair. Not only thin, but fine and smooth. Let me define those terms.

Thin hair means I have not a lot of strands on my head. 

Fine hair means the individual strand width is not big around.

Smooth means each strand has little friction against the others.

I have my hair highlighted blonde because bleach damages the hair strands and makes them a little frizzy. This helps with body.

I never use conditioner.

So I have little hair which is small and lays like silk against my small melon (head). Not only that, the back of my head is pretty flat, so if I don't poof it out at the back I look sort of like a half melon stood on end. 

In addition, I have a wide neck. So if I cut my hair into a pixie cut I just look out of proportion. Like Zippy the Pinhead if you're familiar with that comic. The best look for me is a turtleneck (which have, unfortunately, fallen out of fashion somewhat) and during summers I am SOL. I wear v-neck shirts exclusively which helps, somewhat.

All of this means if I want to leave the house each morning looking halfway decent, I HAVE to wash and blow dry my hair. Every day. If I shower at night and want to 'get up and go' the next day it requires a hat. 

I am constantly asked why I keep my hair short. It's because I cannot grow it long. First of all, it stops growing when it gets to my shoulders and second, it gets stringy at the bottom long before that point. I would grow it out and put it into a ponytail but that exacerbates the smallness of my melon and the ponytail is only about half an inch thick. The Asian women at my work exclaim over how small it is. I have yet to come up with a witty comeback.

Google ""fine thin hair"" and you'll find photos of various celebrities **including Jennifer Anniston**. Are you fucking kidding me? She's GREEK. You'll also find a lot of photos of people with huge heads and thin necks which can make short hair look pretty good.

Everyone thinks they can give me advice despite the fact that I've been living with this hair for over 40 years. ""Oh, you should try this"" or ""My friend did that"", all of which assumes I don't know or understand how my hair grows and what looks best on me.  They all ""know"" what will look better despite never having worked with my hair, head, neck or face. 

When I had extensions they were so very pretty. People smiled at me, held doors for me, hit on me. I was dating at the time and I posted a pic online and within a day or two had over 200 responses. Before I had the extensions I had maybe 15 over a week. 

Guys who can't grow beards know my pain, to an extent. They understand what it's like to want something that others have but they cannot have. But... imagine if 99% of actors had beards. If every guy on a magazine cover had a beautiful beard. Imagine if it was universally accepted that beards were attractive and no beard was what older or less-attractive guys had. Imagine if every woman they met was taken with beards and most guys could grow beards and beards were the absolute norm. Yeah.

I do the best I can. /rant

1399562229.0,Some perspective on the new default status of twoX,"I've been on Reddit for over a year now and while I don't post much, I spend a lot of time on the website just learning new things related to my interests or seeing interesting things that people have experienced. As a woman, it is sometimes hard to love reddit because of the frequent misrepresentation of women and the misunderstandings that happen so often about women. 

I'm well aware that there are subreddits like /r/feminism but I was afraid of subscribing because I didn't know if the subreddit was full of women wanting to support feminism or if it was a bunch of man-haters looking to circlejerk in the opposite direction. I had no idea that twoX existed until it became a default and it looks like exactly what I need in terms of a female perspective subreddit. I also find that it is probably what the entire reddit community needs in terms of a default subreddit to represent what women have to say. 

While it's true that putting the community on public display means that you're going to have to deal with trolls and misconceptions on a regular basis it's also the case that people that are not women will now have the opportunity to hear what women have to say. It's also the case that women on reddit will discover that there are many other women out there that they can relate to and talk with. 

It's true that its hard to talk about being a woman with people that are not women. Every person has lived a very different life from everyone else and sometimes it's hard to feel as though there are people that are actually taking your perspective seriously. While these conversations are extremely hard to have and often frustrating they need to happen. People need to stop perpetuating false notions about women (or all genders for that matter). This subreddit can help to do just that. And when trolls come along, report them. It will be hard to not take what they say personally but don't take it personally. That's exactly what they want you to do. 

Anyway. tl;dr I think this should be a default because reddit needs more women voices. And it's going to be hard sometimes but we should put ourselves out there. ",TwoXChromosomes

I don't really care about the wedding itself, I just want to be married to the love of my life, but I do want the ceremony/ritual is slightly important to me, I want  it to be beautiful and memorable.

1672154896.0,The hate Kim Kardashian is getting right now is mind-boggling.,"I just commented aloud on the amount of toxicity on articles discussing Kim Kardashian and her attempts to co-parent peacefully with Ye. My sister said ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs not like she does anything. I don‚Äôt know why you feel bad for her.‚Äù

That‚Äôs basically what every comment on FB says too. ‚ÄúWow must be so hard with all those nannies.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt least Ye doesn‚Äôt exploit his kids.‚Äù ‚ÄúAll she wants is money.‚Äù ‚ÄúMust be hard when she‚Äôs getting 200k in child support from him every month.‚Äù

People. There are totally legitimate criticisms of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. But these comments are rooted in misogyny, plain and simple. Kim works hard for her money: she‚Äôs poked and prodded for hours daily, she does frequent appearances, she‚Äôs on set and filmed constantly, she sells multiple products and runs a successful business. You can argue she‚Äôs paid more than she‚Äôs worth, or millionaires shouldn‚Äôt exist, or whatever, but it‚Äôs ridiculous to suggest she‚Äôs just sitting on a golden throne doing nothing. 

And the comments criticizing her parenting and saying she‚Äôs worse than Ye as a parent. I have no inside scoop ‚Äî and no one else does ‚Äî but from all appearances she cares about her kids and has made sacrifices for them. Having nannies doesn‚Äôt make someone a bad mom.

Last but not least. The totally unjust accusation that she‚Äôs ‚Äúworse‚Äù than Ye because she‚Äôs a reality TV star or something. I haven‚Äôt heard Kim making awful anti-Black and antisemitic statements so I think we can all agree she‚Äôs not worse than Ye. Again, you may disagree with her lifestyle choices, but Kim has advocated repeatedly and successfully for unfairly incarcerated individuals. This woman is not worse than Ye.

1399558113.0,"Boyfriend broke my trust in him, how should we salvage our relationship? (we have too many mutual friends for me to speak openly about this)","The other day I decided to download Snapchat. I had it on an old phone, but the only people ever talked to was my best friend and my boyfriend (whom I'll refer to as ""A"") . I was getting reacquainted with it when I noticed Snapchat has a feature I didn't remember: it shows a user's 'score' and the top few people they talk to. And I didn't recognize any of the three people A was apparently interacting with often. I had a feeling one of them was his cousin (spoiler, it wasnt) so I decided to Google them. 

One had a twitter account under the same name. She lived far away, was a few years younger than us, and one of those cute little petite brunettes that always make me feel insecure. Worse than that, though, was the fact that she had uploaded a screenshot of MY BOYFRIENDS FACE from Snapchat to her Twitter and it had the hashtag of ""man crush monday"". 

My first reaction was, naturally, OH HELL NO. 

I want to murder her, but to be honest she probably has no idea he has a gf. So I closed out her Twitter and popped open a bottle of wine (Line 39 Petite Sirah, if you're curious). 

After I calmed down, I texted the boyfriend. He immediately acknowledged he was in the wrong, shouldn't have done it, he kept saying ""I don't know what I was thinking"", and that I deserve better, especially with what happened between my ex-fianc√© and I (long story short, he was constantly emotionally abusive, tried to cheat on me (but was kind of a stereotypical neckbeard so he never got out of his self-imposed friendzones) and basically tried to change me from who I am to some meek little girl who did his bidding. I think the worst part about this was that A knew all this, and still chatted with other girls without telling me. 

He crossed a boundary, one that we've discussed I am not okay with him crossing. So it isn't like it would've been a surprise that I'd be upset if I found out about it. He probably thought he could essentially stay anonymous and anyone he was talking to out of his real life. 

Now, there are two reasons why I'm not going to break up with him. 1) he has always been a little naive when it comes to relationships. He only has had two girlfriends and lost his virginity at 20, when most people I know lost it under 18. His first gf was a normal relationship, they just realized it wasn't working out after a couple of years and parted ways fairly amicably. The second was a ridiculously hot girl who has guys throwing themselves at her left and right. She essentially used A for half a year to drive her around, pay for her pot, and then ignored him for an entire winter, before coming back into his life for another couple of months before A realized what was going on. He has been picky about dating ever since, and somehow we never crossed paths until a year and a half ago, despite having quite a few really good mutual friends. We clicked instantly, and it's safe to say that he is pretty much me with a penis. 

That's actually why I can understand WHY he'd want to talk to other girls. I'm not gonna lie, I like attention. I dress really well, and I'm the type to get free drinks from bartenders. I don't think I'm beautiful, but I think I have a friendly disposition and a nice smile that makes people like me. I even did that stupid /r/rateme once because I was curious what other people would say about me (mixed reviews, and a lot of creepy pm's. Learned my lesson -  I don't need THAT kind of validation). The difference is my boyfriend is fully aware of these things. They aren't surprises. When a bartender bet a free drink that I couldn't do a cartwheel, I told my boyfriend what I was doing. The same with the rateme subreddit. It isn't that I wanted permission and I don't necessarily want to give him permission, but I want his honesty. 

And I consider lies of omission as dishonesty. I probably would be a little uncomfortable if I knew he was talking to other girls, but I think him making it clear he has a gf would have been all I needed if he had told me he wanted to connect with other people across the United States. I honestly think it didn't occur to him what he was really doing, and that it mattered. Or fell under the boundaries I previously set. 

2) He absolutely started bawling when he thought I was going to break up with him. He isn't the type to show or speak about his feelings really. He likes to touch me a lot, just nonsexually, a caress here, a little squeeze there. He says stuff like ""I love you"" and has expressed that he sees a future with me, and would like to get married and have children with me, but nothing poetic, emotional, etc. We've actually been working on that aspect of our relationship, to decent results. But I digress; so he burst into tears. He didn't try to gaslight me or act like he didn't do anything wrong, like other people do. I must admit it was pretty satisfying watching a 6'2"" semi-athletic manly man type break down and throw himself and his future at my mercy. 

My parameters are that he can never, ever do this before. He knows I've stuck to my guns in past relationships regarding  that concept. I also told him he'd have to really work at his communication, and we'd have to repair our bond quite a bit because of how overwhelmingly disappointing this infidelity was. I also warned him that it would likely be a while before we had sex again, because frankly once I've developed an emotional bond to a sexual partner, I can't remove that emotion from sex. And of course I'm still in love with him, and hurting too, so having sex with him is going to cut me up, no matter how good it is. I also said I was going to look into ways to rebuild our relationship (I'm pretty big into psychology, though I know it isn't a perfect science) and that if I found something that I thought might help, I'd want to try it. No idea what I even really mean by that, to be honest. 

So yeah. That was a terrible day. My relationship, once so very great, hit one hell of  speed bump. It can't be swept under the rug, but I'm not going to let it be the elephant in the room nobody talks about. He is more than willing to take the time and effort to help me heal. He accepts that it'll take time to heal. 

Mostly I just had to get this off my chest, and I was wondering how other relationships survive inappropriate flirting, cheating, and/or infidelity. I don't accept the excuse ""boys will be boys"", and I don't accept stupid ""biotruths"" that men are going to always want other women. I'm not saying that can't look, I certainly do, but I believe in communication and honesty, and consider this a breach of those. Considering that this sub is now a default, I'm aware this will likely get down votes, but I'm hoping that the normal audience of TwoX will see this and comment as well. I really just want support and advice on how to get through this. I absolutely do not think this is something I should break up with him, unless he does it again.

The distance hasn't been a big deal (although I absolutely hate having to pack everything up on my own) but as I sit here, surrounded by our boxed-up lives and cleaning supplies, I'm starting to panic.  

I haven't been financially dependent upon anyone since high school.  Except for the small amounts of help from my mother throughout my college days, I've done pretty much everything on my own.  Now, all of a sudden, I'm going to be dependent upon someone else for my finances... at least for a little while.  I've been searching and applying to jobs in our new city, but have gotten nowhere.  I have a pretty marketable degree, decent experience, and a lot of passion, but no job.  

I think the panic I feel is coming from the worry that, for some unknown reason, my boyfriend and I will break up and I will be left poor and alone.  I am also finding myself equating a paycheck with self worth and am feeling pretty down about the entire situation.  He proposed getting a joint bank account and has set up direct deposit from his job into that account, but I just don't feel right spending his money.  

If anyone has experience with this, I'd love some advice.

1399508385.0,How do you exude professional confidence?,"I always love the advice this subreddit provides, and I'm not sure where else to ask. So thank you in advance to all the professional/confident women who may help me out.

I've just received a huge promotion and will be the assistant manager in a store with over 60 associates. I will be in charge of teaching, leading, correcting, and assisting these associates. I've been in positions of leadership before, but not to this level.

I was originally confident that I would succeed, but my training has shaken that confidence.  I am young, and look younger than I am.  Many of the associates I will be in charge of have worked in that building longer than I've been alive, and have a reputation for challenging fresh meat.  Despite that, I felt ready.

However, all the people who have been training me have assumed I am not confident, saying things like if I don't toughen up, I will be ""chewed up and spit out"".  This was based not on my prior leadership skills, because they haven't witnessed those, but based on how I present myself in my interactions. I'm shy, soft spoken, and very quiet until I feel comfortable. The people I've worked with for years have no doubt in my knowledge and skill, but there is a discrepancy in how I am read by those I don't know well.

My question is: what are some tips to exude the confidence I had without coming off as a know it all? What are some tips for addressing or correcting people old enough to be my grandparents, who know as much as I do about our industry? How can I not appear afraid, but not seem naive to the challenges I will face?

I already bought some professional clothing and am considering a haircut, but tips are welcome here as well.

How can I get my confidence to shine through?

Former fiance heard me say ""I am unhappy in our relationship because you allow your family to treat me like crap, and you put your mothers wants before my needs every time"" (including when WE bought a car) Over, and over, and over.

After a year of telling him the same thing, I was done.  When we broke up, he was shocked! He thought we were happy!  You have to give me a second chance!  You never told me there was a problem!

Ignoring the fact I had already given him a hundred second chances at least.  But no, I obviously left him for another man!  I didn't I left him for my sanity.

I see the same thing in my current marriage of 20+ years.  I say the same things over and over and over (much smaller scale stuff).

I've come to the  conclusion that because what bothers ME doesn't bother THEM, it's obviously not   a problem, and I'm jist being silly and emotional.  I'm dead certain if marriage therapy doesn't work, I'll be leaving once our youngest is done high school.  Yet again, it will be: You never told me you were unhappy!

So many women post about sexual violence, and get torn down like they're evil man-haters who have nothing better to do than reputation ruin. 

We get stats thrown at us about how women lie, and lectured about how sexual allegations against men are life ruining. 

But Terry Crews tells the same story that millions of us have, and there isn't a negative message to be seen. 

No lectures. No accusations. No rape threats or violence. 

Just empathy and understanding. The sentiments that we all ask for and rarely receive. 

I am so happy that the conversation is shifting, and that Terry is getting the support that he needs and deserves.

1399493529.0,Possible allergy to long-term Paragard? Thoughts please.,"Hi everyone. I've had a paragard for 3 years. I wonder if this is related or not. My question is as follows:

I keep getting infections. For the past 4 months, every month before my period I get a yeast infection or BV. Usually they go away when my period starts, but not this time. I'm actually itching *inside* (Also outside). It burns when I pee & I itch continuously.  

I also have begun to spot before & after my periods. Last month my period was 2 weeks late (it came the day after my husband came home from the oilfield, haha whoops), which I chalked up to stress. It started right after we DTD.  I had a really light (for me) period, but it lasted *12 days* (So no more fun times & then he had to leave again!). I use a Diva Cup & that's practically unheard of for me (I usually can't leave the house the first two days). 

A year ago when I got my pap the iud had migrated to the side (not sure why). The strings are so short I have never been able to reach them. When I went to the dr they brushed off my concerns & said it was just the iud adjusting. Since it is non- hormonal & it's been 3 years, shouldn't my body have adjusted by now? 

I am also very allergic to nickel (I break out & get a weeping itchy rash from copper plated nickel, silver plated nickel, etc). I know that the paragard has a nickel core (just a tiny amount). Could I have developed an allergy to my iud? 

I am not averse to getting it out, it's just really expensive w/o insurance. 

Note: I am not eating processed sugary foods & am eating a ""keto"" diet (basically very low carb paleo).

A little background: I have been working in this line of work for a while now (3 years at my present company, seven years total professional experience). It's a male-heavy industry, but I am one of two women in my specific department. The issue I'm confused about here involves being a 32 year old woman who looks approx 10 years younger than I actually am. Normally, I'm pretty pumped that people see me as younger, but my co workers are all below the age of 25. I've been thinking more about this lately, especially since we just hired a new person right out of college. He's 22. 

Aside from feeling a bit like Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused (I keep getting older while they stay the same age) I am wondering if looking much younger is hurting my career. I'd like to move up and be given the opportunity to grow, but feel like I can't because my superiors might think I ""lack experience"". Not everyone knows my work history. But I feel like I am to blame for letting my bosses think I'm a 22 year old newb because I'm viable parinoid about my actual age, rather then reminding then I'm been working for 17 damn years, and in this industry for 7. 

I'm also a little ashamed because  hiding my age is such a ""woman"" thing (ugh) that is to be expected. 

I'm sorry if this is not the right place, but it's such a weird situation and thought some other woman has had this sort of thing happen, and how the hell do I deal with this conflict in my head? 

I guess that I should mention that every time I bring up my age to anyone, ANYONE, they don't believe me. I still get carded at bars and when buying wine out. Last week when I told a fellow female worker in another department that we are, in fact the same age, after she condescended to me she demanded to see my damn drivers license.

AND I CANNOT believe we're making the actual emotional biases behind wasting money a trend. We're talking about it and that's good. But we're progressing in the wrong direction! This is like those other trends like the shopping therapy one, ""self care"" but much worse

My boyfriend and I went to a party with his co-workers whom I had never met. He never drinks a lot but that night he drank way to much so i had to drive him home to his parents. I thought it was very silly at first since I had never seen him like that so I was in a good mood walking him to the car. When I started driving  I wasn't exactly sure how to get home so  he told me where to go. After a couple of minutes I noticed we weren't going in the right direction so i told him he was wrong, he then got very mad and started yelling and yanking at my seat belt so I parked his car at a parking lot. I tried getting my phone to work but it died so I took his phone, he then started telling me to put ""the numbers in a computer"" I just ignored him since he wasn't being very clear and I kept telling him I was doing that. He then got furious and started yelling for me to look at him and since I didn't he grabbed on to my wrists and wouldn't let go. I got really scared specially since he had never done anything like that to me ever . I started screaming and yelling for him to let me go and I got one hand loose so I smacked him and he then slapped me back so hard. Then I started crying and I didn't know what to do so I called his mother and told her I was taking him then he tried to grab me again and the phone fell so I ran out the car and when he tried to follow me he fell and he calmed down. I then grabbed the phone and told his mother he hurt me but that he was calm so I'd start driving. On the drive back he kept yanking the seat belt and he tried to put it around my neck but when I yelled he moved back. He then started saying really weird things like how did I hurt you if you don't have feelings and ""is it OK if I rape you"". At that point I was close to his home so I felt like I was in a trance so I got off and helped him to his door. His mother answered the door and asked what happened but I couldn't even talk and the whole time my parents had been calling me so called back and they said they were on their way. His mother offered me a ride but I told her no since I didn't want to be near them. She then took him inside and he kept ranting about how he was afraid of me and how he didn't trust me and when I went near him and he yelled not to touch him, everything exactly how I had told him on the road moments prior. So she asked what I had done and I just walked out in time to see my sister in the front door. I ran to her and she hugged me and asked me what was wrong I told her my so had hit me and she them tried to run inside but so's mother wouldn't let her and she told my sister I had no idea what I was saying and she told us to go home. My father tried to talk to her but she said we had to hear his side of the story. So I went home with my family. My family was furious because they had trusted him and they were mad at his mother for her behavior towards me. The next afternoon he texts me that he's sorry but doesn't remember a thing and that his mother asked what I had done to him so I explained to him the same story and he felt bad and said he wanted to talk to my parents. I told him to clear things up with his parents because I thought it was unfair that they put the blame on me. He waited until the next day and he came over after that. Now I was raised to believe that men don't hit women and I always told myself I'd leave whoever laid hands on me. So he apologized and asked why I had let him drink so much and he said it wasn't him that he'd never do anything like that but I couldn't even bear sitting next to him because I was so scared and I felt like he didn't understand how terrified I had been that Saturday night so I told him to leave. Before he left my mother asked him to talk to her so they sat down and she (surprisingly calm) told him she was disappointed in him and that his mother owed me an apology earlier  he said his mother wasn't mean to me but my sister explained to him what happened and he said we were right. And this is where I'm not sure I did the right thing or not because even though he seemed sincere I told him I didn't want to be with him. My mother told him to try to get me back and now I'm sitting here in my bed not knowing what to do and I'm too embarrassed to ask for advice from anyone. sorry for the rant and thanks for reading .

I started taking Loestrin 24 FE in September of 2013. The first five months or so were perfectly normal (typical light spotting issues the first month or two as are common when starting the pill, so I consider that to be ""normal""). I still got periods, but they were significantly lighter than what I'd had before.

The fifth month is where things started to get weird. I normally take my pills at night before bed, but forgot to one night, so I took it first thing in the morning -- about 12 hours later. According to my pill, that's perfectly fine. Two weeks later, spotting, and I was 5 days away from the 4 placebo pills. Period came as normal.

Then, the next month, I spotted very very lightly in the first half of the pack... followed by no period at all during the placebos. Again, fell asleep before taking my pill just one time, but took it first thing the next morning, well within 12 hours.

After no period at all during the placebos, I started the next pack. 6 days into the new pack, I started cramping/bleeding... was light at first, then much like a regular period... and it lasted nearly a week. I've also been kind of queasy some mornings. Nothing that keeps me from eating, but sometimes I'm not as hungry as I used to be when I wake up.

My boyfriend (he's clean) and I just use the pill as BC. I've taken 2 pregnancy tests after not bleeding on the placebos -- both came back negative.

I've been a bit more stressed than usual the past 6 weeks, and I've changed my diet/exercise regime slightly the past few months. But I'm just a little paranoid that something could be up. Obviously concerned about the possibility of pregnancy even though the tests came up negative (the internet has lots of scary stories about this happening). I went to the doctor, told her all this, and her conclusion was to up my dosage starting on the next pack.

I'm getting worried that any assertive or dominant behavior in a woman is getting demonized. These analogies put forth, eg, on the latest ask Reddit page, are behaviors that people are much more permissive of in men. Eg- ask for the manager. 

1) it is unlikely Karen would ask for the manager if she were... I dunno.. Phil, because the worker will scramble if Phil is annoyed. 


2) If Phil asks for the manager, the next words will be ""I'm sorry, sir""

3) His issue won't dismissed as petty, even if it is


I have seen people avoid asking for anything fixed, eg, missing food or the wrong meal, for fear of seeming like a ""Karen"". That is a disservice to the server and the restaurant because this winds up being potentially reflected in a tip without a chance to fix it.


It's hard enough to be taken seriously, and now... 

I worry that any assertive behavior is getting lumped into ""Karen"". I saw a video that made me ask if I am one. I only recently grew a spine after a lifetime of being abused in one way or another. I try to keep my spine, but I know that psychologically, people dislike overweight people etc, so the moment I am assertive- with a higher pitched voice, with my weight, they probably roll their eyes and dismiss me. 

It's so easy to just lapse into being as little a bother as possible, even when it's literally someone's job to bother. And they did it wrong in a way that means I have paid for food I can't eat because it will make my mouth break out in blisters  :(

1702395745.0,I love being a woman,"Hi there, trans woman here. I just wanted to share my own perspective on womanhood, and why despite all its dangers, I genuinely love it. 

I love being able to show emotion genuinely. Being a boy was all about being tough and showing nothing, and I just love being able to be happy and bubbly, or sad, or whatever, and *showing* that. I feel so much more in tune with myself, being able to express myself freely instead of bottling everything up for the sake of meaningless social expectations. 

I love my body. Maybe this is weird and/or lesbian brain, but I just love the curves and shape of my body as estrogen works. I love femininity, and being able to express it with my body. And its not just mine; The variety of body types in women are all beautiful. 

I love the style choices for women. The colors, the patterns, the style‚Äîits so varied and brilliant. I know women are pressured to wear makeup, which is a bad thing to be sure, but at the same time I love wearing it. All the possibilities for appearances and dressing up are magical to me. The myriad ways of expressing womanhood are all wonderful, whichever direction you go.

Most of all, I love the solidarity with other women. The way women treat each other is so much better. There's just such a sense of camaraderie and sisterhood that men don't have anything like. The feeling of mutual support I see is wonderful. Even just the way women will compliment each other on whatever, it's beautiful to me.

I know womanhood isn't all perfect. I know the risks we face every day. Goddess, I know there's a flipside to the things I've listed here, and that some of them probably arent universal. But all things considered, I still love it. I love being a woman.",TwoXChromosomes

1400265292.0,To the mods of TwoX: Going default was a good decision,"We've heard a lot about why everybody thinks the defaulting of this sub was a bad decision.   

* On the one hand, we've got the faithful TwoX subscribers who are battling the influx of shitposting and rage-inducing commenters and fear that our little 'safe' space is going to the dogs. 
* On the other hand we've got the MENZ. The ones who are pissed off that their internets are contaminated with with girl germs and instead of unsubscribing, they'd rather tell us how wrong we are to think we deserve a portion of their all important brain space (it is usually quite limited in these specimens, so I can see why they'd want to prioritise it...)
 
While I have zero sympathy for the latter, and a lot of empathy for the former... I still disagree with both. I think making TwoX a default was NEEDED, and I'm glad the mods decided to give it a go. I hope they stay with it for a little bit longer. 
 
My reasoning: reddit needs more diversity on its front page and in its default subreddits if it's ever going to become a less shitty echo-chamber of awfulness. As a woman and a redditor for 7 years or more (on my regular account) I've seen reddit go through a lot of changes. Over the years, I've retreated into fewer and fewer subreddits because of the shitty behaviour and opinions of the masses. There are now maybe five subreddits I visit on a regular basis, twox being one of them. I'm not a particularly fragile flower, so the fact that I feel reddit is basically a hostile, unlikeable space for the most part is probably a good indicator that plenty of others do too - and anecdotally I think we can all agree a lot of women feel that way.  
 
**This general awfulness will never change unless there is more diversity in the defaults.**

Does this mean things are going to be easy? No. It probably means TwoX will go to shit... for a while at least. It probably means the mods are going to have a hell of a job moderating shitposts and shitty comments. It means we, the community, are going to have to put up with some uncomfortable situations - and I by no means think the community has to put up with something that makes them uncomfortable. Sexual harassment or rape threats or anything of that nature is **not acceptable**. For users who have to deal with that (and the fear of it is what's causing me to use this alt today, tbh), I'm not sure what the answer is. I'm not sure what's best. For those who choose to stay and engage in TwoX anyway, we'll have to be strong and vigilant and report bad behaviour to mods and admins.  
 
Default status may even mean - worst case scenario - that TwoX is unsalvageable. But I know that you're not going to make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. Hopefully the eventual omelette of a nicer, more equal and tolerant reddit is a delicious omelette worth fighting for (ok, my metaphor ability sucks...)  
 
In the mean time, I'd like to mention that /r/SRSWomen exists - it's a lot like TwoX but men are explicitly forbidden from posting/commenting and some women here might find it a safer space than TwoX until shit dies down here.  
 
**edit:** if there are other women-focused subs that explicitly foster a safe space for women, let me know and I'll list them here too. I realise /r/srswomen might be offputting for some, but I honestly don't know of another sub that strictly enforces a safe space for women...

1399538128.0,My husband is a sexist asshole who harasses all the women that work for him.,"I usually browse more than post, but I'm going to use a throw away anyway to avoid being identified.

My husband and I have been married for a year. We're both pretty young - I'm 21 and he's 22. I'm in graduate school and he graduated from undergrad last year.

He opened up a restaurant 6 months ago. For those of you that don't know, the restaurant business is pretty terrifying. Like 99% of new restaurants fail. But he's doing okay. Business was really good for the first month and has trailed off some, but it's held steady for a while and it's good enough to support us comfortably.

The issue is he's a sexist pig. He treats all the waitresses very poorly. He's very belittling and treats them like they're idiots. Just as an example, some time ago he started calling the waitresses ""his girls"" and himself the ""pimp master"". It's gotten to the point where he purchased a purple suit and cane that he wears when he's at the restaurant. 

He claims it's okay because they don't mind because he's paying them well (they make $15/hr + tips). But that makes it worse - most of them are college students (we're located about a 2 minute walk from a very very large university. Most of the people that live/go here are students and it's where all the good restaurants/bars are), so they're just willing to put up with being harassed because, like most college kids, they need the money.

I figured that after a little while customers would see his behavior, get mad, and he'd be forced to not be a douchebag and that'd be the end of it, but it hasn't happened. The customers don't give a shit. 

His behavior is also a bad example for the customers. The average customer is a drunk 20 year old (the restaurant is right by most of the bars - literally 50% of the people that come in are drunk. Peak hours are between 10pm and 3am on Friday and Saturday, as an example.) Seeing him be an asshole to the waitresses encourages the customers to do the same, making their job even harder.

He's also an asshole to all the female customers, but to a lesser extent.

My boss to then went on to state he was hired at $50k As a buyer.

Now, a little background on why this irks me.
1. I held the buyer position until my current boss was hired for it, I trained him. At the time I was making around $37-$38k. He was making $50k.
2.I'm literally the first employee ever hired at this branch. Ive held every position at this branch simultaneously before, with the exception of GM.
3. I'm the only female. Ever. In 4 years I'm the ONLY female At this branch. I've heard things said such as ""this is a man's company"" and my previous boss outright blatantly stating ""no more women at this branch"".
4.I offered my current boss that I would absorb the buyer position into my daily duties for a raise, which would have saved them 10's of thousands of dollars a year but was completely disregarded.
5. My current boss was promoted to GM above me, and I once again had to train him for that position. Even though I never officially held it, I had to assume the role sometimes when my previous boss was out.
6. My previous boss raped me. He was terminated because of that, and has since moved on to a company we have worked with in the past. I come into work one morning and see my current boss has forwarded me an email asking me to quote something for my previous boss. When I told him I was in no way comfortable with this situation, I was told to ""Let it go, it's in the past"".

I called / emailed the physical  planning of my school several times and no one took my call or replied to me.  I called the animal shelter to see if they had received any cats from campus, they assured me they haven't.  During the day I wasn't too worried cause I had hopes they ran and hid (but the hole *was* their hiding place), so I just stayed by the computer and the phone and went there several times to see if maybe they had escaped before the hole was cemented.

1413401614.0,R.E: ALL ABOUT THAT BASS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE BAD FOR FEMALE BODY IMAGE,"http://spoonuniversity.com/2014/10/bass-delivering-harmful-messages/ (original article)

Ok so I never do this, but this is something that I feel so strongly about that I feel the need to share my opinion. I have to say I agree with this article 100%. As a naturally skinny person when I first heard this song, I felt disgusted. Not at the song, at myself. I am that ‚Äúskinny bitch‚Äù that she refers to, I have no junk in no places and I am that size 2. (UK size 4) All my life I have had to smile and laugh when girls and boys say to me ‚Äúomg you‚Äôre so skinny go eat something.‚Äù To which I always have and always will reply, I do eat, I eat more in 1 day than you will eat in 2 or 3. You know why? Because for years I have been obsessed with putting weight on. People ignorantly say to me ‚ÄúI wish I had that problem.‚Äù They don‚Äôt realise, that ‚Äúmy problem‚Äù is just the same as theirs. I feel the same way that they do when they look in the mirror and hate what they see. Now in no way am I looking for any sympathy from anyone, I just want people to think about how they would feel if I approached them and said ‚ÄúOmg you‚Äôre too fat, stop eating‚Äù because I‚Äôm pretty sure someone would easily lift their hand and smack me upside the head.





If it‚Äôs not ok for skinny girls to call out bigger girls, then why is it acceptable for bigger girls to call out skinny girls? Even as I write this I have deleted the word ‚Äúfat‚Äù and replaced it with ‚Äúbigger‚Äù because I‚Äôm very aware that by using the word fat, I could easily offend a lot of people. 




Like the author of this article said, the lyrics of this song say ‚Äúboys like a little more booty to hold at night.‚Äù And I would love to know why when girls talk about their size, it always comes down to what MEN prefer. Even on any social media platform there are always girls sharing those stupid pictures with the quotes alone side them saying ‚Äúreal men prefer curves, if they wanted bones they would get a dog.‚Äù Not too sound too much of a feminist here but why the sweet fuck (sorry mummy) do you care that much what boys like? Because believe it or not girls, boys like anything they can get their hands on. They will tell you whatever the hell you want to hear just to get close to you. Yes I get that girls naturally do crave the approval of men, it is just how we are programmed but if you feel like you have to body shame any other type of girl to get that approval, then you need to work on your own insecurities and who YOU are as a person. 



Now I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and say that all girls should unite and come together to stop this because that‚Äôs not going to happen. Girls see each other as competition, whether you like to admit it to yourself or not it‚Äôs true. But what we should be doing is working on ourselves as individuals, if you are confident and believe that YOU are an attractive woman then you will not feel the need to bring others down. I genuinely believe that songs like this and even Nicki Minaj‚Äôs Anaconda, (yes I‚Äôm going there, just because I love Nicki Minaj more than you love your mother does not mean I‚Äôm going to ignore the fact that anaconda is equally sending out the same message with lines like ‚Äúfuck the skinny bitches.‚Äù) make it more difficult, for girls who do not fit those descriptions, to feel confident in themselves. I have seen a lot of people arguing that bigger girls have been bashed for so long that it‚Äôs their turn to feel beautiful now. 



Yes there was a time when people highlighted skinny as being the most desired and the most beautiful body form. But, and please feel free to correct me if I am wrong, never has there ever been a song about how big girls are not attractive. People simply would not stand for it, so why when the tables are turned do people laugh and sing along? Like the article states, we need to get away from the idea that women‚Äôs bodies are objects that need to be worked on. Because it‚Äôs not, what we need to be working on is who we are as people and how our words and actions affect other people.


No doubt after I post this, people will have plenty to say but I genuinely don‚Äôt care. At 20 years of age, I have JUST reached a point in my life where I have accepted that I can‚Äôt change my body, no matter what I eat, I‚Äôm not going to put any weight on. It is just my natural form. I have embraced my small boobs, my thigh gap, my knobbly knees and my small (but not flat) behind. And honestly, if you haven‚Äôt reached this point yet, I can‚Äôt wait to you do, because once you accept it and realise there‚Äôs not a lot you can do about it. You will be a much happier person. Peace out.

In fact, they get told that they're imagining it, or get downvoted into oblivion for daring to suggest that misogyny is a part of their lives. I got lectured today by someone who claims that because I live in the UK and not Iran or Africa, I have no idea what oppression looks like. Women in the UK have total equality, they said, and only a priveleged dumb bitch would talk about encountering sexism from the patriarchy (because we all know that in a REAL patriarchy women have no rights whatsoever).

This is BULLSHIT! I am so tired of men who have never had to wear my shoes for a day telling me that misogyny is a lie I've invented because I want to be a victim. I don't know if they're scared or angry or just pig ignorant but it's exhausting, and moreover they don't seem to realise that men feeling entitled to tell women what to think is an EXAMPLE of inequality. When they see stories about the oppression of women in a real patriarchal society like Iran or Africa, men on Reddit start crowing about how it's an atrocity, but they cannot or will not acknowledge what is right in front of them, the stealthy oppression of women still happening in First World countries, where we're constantly told we are equal but know it's not true.

""Even people like you deserve a chance at happiness"" ""Really?! But, you look like a girl!"" ""Look on the bright side, at least you never have to have a period.""


I'm mtf transgender if that wasn't obvious, I cringe a little bit just having to type those words. 


Transgender, it's a pretty innocuous little word with a simple etymology, but it holds a lot of weight for me. I feel shame go through me as soon as I see it, that nauseating little surge of pain we all feel sometimes, letting us know that we have failed, not just ourselves - our friends and families too.


That's what I feel like, a freak and a failure, an outcast and a spectacle.


I don't want to be seen anymore, I just want to be left alone, I don't want you criticism or your complements. I don't want to be told I'm brave, I don't want a special support group for me and all the other freaks.


I know I'm not being fair to myself, I would never call another lgbt person a freak or judge them, but I just loath myself.


And I envy you, and my envy just festers and turns into bitterness and self hatred. I envy you so much just for getting to be women, for being free to use that as a matter of fact label instead of a radical assertion. I envy you because you never have to know what it feels like to see your body changed into something so disgusting, so shameful and abhorrent. I envy your voices, I used to love singing, but no matter how I strain the sound of my own voice racks my body with another surge of shame and fear. I envy that you get to enjoy your body and feel sexy without being labeled as deviants or autogynephiles or some other pseudoscientific nonsense. I envy that you get to have relationships without having to have a talk about your history or the stats of your genitals.


I hate psychiatrists and doctors, I hate their arrogant scrutiny of something that is so saliently urgent and valid to me. I hate reddit and it's pedants, I hate radical feminists and their insistence that hormone therapy is abuse. I fucking hate testosterone. I fucking hate the gender roles I was forced into that made me assume that I was simply broken and inadequate. I hate the society that made me lie to myself for years. I hate this quarreling tangled mess of desires and fears between my ears, it just feels like I'm being torn apart some days.

I don't do this out of bravery, I do it out of fear, but I suppose you can't be brave without being scared. I do this because I know if I didn't all I would have left is distractions and drugs. I do this because I don't want to inflict the pain of my suicide upon my family.


I just want this all to be taken away, this burden to be lifted, but it won't be. I can learn to manage it, but it won't leave. There's no justice, there's no plan. It could be so much worse, I could have died of leukemia when I was 5 instead of this. But that's not how our perception of pain works.

I'm told I need to smile differently, that my eyebrows are too thick, etc. This has happened literally every time I posted something stating I was trans, and has never happened where I didn't reveal that information.

This ""constructive criticism"" really isn't helpful. Most of us know what we need to do, and we sometimes have trouble doing it safely. For example, I have yet to have my eyebrows successfully threaded or waxed without having the skin around my brows horribly cut, so I have to be careful about when I can do it. I couldn't wear any jewellery when I was first coming out, despite numerous suggestions to, because the one necklace I had at the time acted as a hate magnet.

Also, it's kind of insulting. Every transgender person I've met has done rather extensive investigation into exactly what they need to do in order to get to where they want. Being told to do everything you're currently working on is just pointless. It's like someone telling you that you should exercise more while you're on a treadmill.

Many people, including both women and men, who wish to discuss serious women's issues only are downvoting posts that they find to be trivial. But the aim of the sub was never to be about serious issues only, so maybe we should all take that into consideration. In the rules section,  the things deemed ""irrelevant"" include :

1478058075.0,Does no one care about sexual assault on the dance floor?,"I'm a bit confused about a common behavior that is tolerated even though it seems like pretty obvious sexual assault. Am I over-reacting here?

Frequently when I'm out dancing with my female friends, some creep will approach me from behind and starting grinding me without permission. They are literally rubbing their crotches against my butt without my permission. But everyone seems to act like this is normal dance floor behavior. If I yell at the guy or push him off too forcefully, people either laugh or act like I'm the one who is being too aggressive.

How is this not sexual assault?! They sneak up on me from behind, so there is no way they could think I gave them permission to touch me. This doesn't happen at every place we go, but it happens enough that I no longer enjoy going out dancing. I'm sick of constantly feeling like I need to watch my back.

For a while, I tried only going dancing with coed groups of friends in hopes that dancing near guy friends would scare off the creeps. But it's not right that I feel like I have to have men by my side to be safe in public. Last week, one of my good guy friends noticed me struggling to push a creep off me and helped push him off me. But everyone was acting like my guy friend was out of line for putting his hands on another guy. It's like grinding is acceptable, but pushing to prevent grinding is not?! ",TwoXChromosomes
1436760055.0,"A 31 year old woman who has never dated, never been kissed, never been intimate, never had a relationship.","I've posted here before and said I've never been with anyone, but anyway. My situation is very unusual. Most people IRL wouldn't believe me if I told them I was a 31 year old virgin. When I was 22 I had a therapist who didn't exactly believe me (helpful, really). I have also never even been kissed. I've never been on a date or really tried, I guess. I thought that it was just supposed to happen naturally in life the way it seems to for everyone. I had a serious crush on my boss for nearly two years, but it's clear that he doesn't feel the same and I'm not really sure how I feel about him anymore and I've started distancing from him.

I feel very bad about this. I really did want to be a happy wife one day, but the older I get, the more this dream seems to be lost to me. I won't settle for just anyone. I can't. I can't risk ending up with the wrong person. I recently had a coworker express interest in a very creepy way. He still won't leave me alone, but that's another story, I guess. He was wrong for me in just about every possible way.

I know I have to try and have a social life and meet people, but the idea terrifies me. I have very severe social anxiety. I don't know what to do about that.

I am embarrassed to admit to this, but recently I tried to initiate ""sexy"" conversations with a few different guys on Reddit. I guess I'm just lonely, and pathetic. None were really interested, maybe because I had a reputation as being sort of a nutcase (I'm not, but some thought I was, I guess). I also made a sort of creepy sexual comment to a guy on Reddit, which was ignored.

I watch a lot of porn...it's embarrassing to lay this all out there, but I feel like I haven't fully told my story. Porn. Men receiving oral, handjobs, men masturbating. So my sex/erotic life consists of crushes that never work out, watching porn, sex scenes in films, and fantasies. At 31.

Needless to say I don't want this situation...it's kind of miserable. I have posted to many places looking for advice, I know I shouldn't be desperate, but I really am. I just don't know what to do.

I don't want to live this way anymore. This is made much more difficult by the fact that I am a very sexual person and would have sex every day, maybe more than once a day, if that was my life. But it's not.

I think about intimacy, think how wonderful it would feel. if only wishing could get you what you want. It just seems like it's so easy for everyone else.

1705006088.0,My best friend almost died in the hospital last week and her husband just... didn't tell me.,"I've been best friends with Anne for over twenty years. We call each other sisters (my family is super dysfunctional and small, and in high school she just basically brought me in to hers). Last month she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She has a really severe heart condition, so her options were limited but her doctors decided to do chemo and then a mastectomy. Her first chemo treatment was meant to be just after Christmas. We'd kept in touch and she wasn't feeling great but was doing ok.

Then last week she just stopped responding. We're on a group text with another friend, and Anne stopped responding there. We both texted her separately and got no response, so we agreed that while we didn't want to bother her if she was just feeling poorly, we were worried and I should reach out to her husband. I texted him last Sunday saying we were worried. He said she was in the hospital with some sort of infection that they were trying to pin down. I asked if either of them needed anything or if I could be helpful with their son, do a grocery run, anything. He said no, he was fine. Then I heard nothing.

As of today, Anne still hadn't responded to anything so I texted him again asking how she was doing and if he needed any help with anything heading into the weekend. He called me, said that the only reason he was even able to make this call was because he was on his way to pick up their son from school, and told me that Anne had gone into shock due to a candida infection, been intubated (was just extubated today), been on a feeding tube, and was still on dialysis. They'd had to take her off of her heart medication while they dealt with the infection, which complicated things further. She was still confused but showed no signs of having had a stroke. After the phone call, he texted me to say that at some point during all of this, her phone was destroyed and even when she was lucid, she wasn't able to contact anyone.

I recognize that when your spouse is dying, your first thought isn't to contact their friends, even if they're considered family. He was just trying to keep his head above water. But then he told me that he'd called his friend (who is a doctor that specializes in a relevant field) and been in communication with him throughout the week, to the point that this friend had traveled across multiple states to be there. After hearing that, I was less sympathetic about him not thinking to contact any of Anne's friends.

I can't really sort out how all I'm feeling. I'm scared for my friend, because further chemo is off the table and no one is sure what longterm damage this has done. I'm scared that we almost lost her. I'm hurt that she could have died and my other friend and I would have had no idea anything was even that serious. And I guess I'm also just really fucking mad that he never thought to level with me about how bad things were despite me reaching out to him multiple times. I called our other friend to give her an update and she feels the same way I do. We both agree that there's nothing to be done, because telling someone whose wife just almost died that he's being an asshole is an awful thing to do, but he was, in fact, being an asshole. After things level out and we get to see our friend, we think we're just going to make a point of telling her that we're glad she's doing better and we're sorry that we weren't more present, we would have been if we'd known what was going on, just so she doesn't think we didn't care.

I'm just kind of feeling a ton of emotions right now and needed to vent.

ETA: by the time I texted on Sunday, Anne had been in the hospital since Thursday and intubated since Saturday, meaning she was already intubated when he told me she was just on antibiotics. I also removed a line that was inadvertently insulting.",TwoXChromosomes

Remember and honor those of my brothers and sisters lost in the last year.

There are many ways you can participate, and it would mean the world to me and my transgender/gender non-conforming (TGNC) family to have you stand with us as allies.

* Find a memorial vigil or event near you and be present. (Find them at www.tdor.info) Nothing has the power to create change like symbolic moments given strength and credibility by the presence of people who care deeply about us.

 If you are here in Kansas City, please join us *tonight* at the JC Nichols fountain near the plaza from **6:30-9pm** to stand and/or walk beside us, or just to be there. Kansas City's community has lost three of our own this year and we will remember them. *Tomorrow*, join us from **2pm - 4:30pm** at Unity Temple on the Plaza for our ""Moving Forward"" celebration, including local TGNC artists and allies (including yours truly!) who will lend their talents and voices to our cause.

* If you can't join us in person, the Twitter account I created for our TDOR event here in Kansas City is tweeting the names of my brothers and sisters lost to hatred and violence this year (EDIT: For those interested, the twitter account can be found [@tdor_kc](http://www.twitter.com/tdor_kc)). You could help signal boost our message by following and retweeting those messages. Even if you don't share them, including the messages in your feed is a small price to pay in remembrance to honor those we have lost.

* Talk about it with your friends and family. Talk about it on Facebook, or wherever you happen to be. Help to spread the word however you can. Wear the color people, the color traditionally associated with the event if you can.

* Change your profile picture on social networks today to include the transgender pride flag today of all days. Visit http://messica.codes/transflag/ to upload your picture.

But above all, do something. Any of the more than three hundred names lost to suicide, anti-trans* violence, and hatred might have been me. Let someone transgender or gender non-conforming know you love or care about them. Please? Thank you.",TwoXChromosomes

1648496445.0,Really disappointed to see so many bad takes coming from white/non-Black women regarding the Will Smith/Chris Rock situation,"Before anyone tries to misconstrue my statement, let me start off by saying that I *do not* condone violence in any form, and Will Smith should not have hit Chris Rock. Now that that‚Äôs out of the way‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm very disappointed at the takes I‚Äôm seeing, especially on this subreddit, from mainly white women/non-black women about the situation. My main problem is that so many of you are saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a joke‚Äù and Will Smith‚Äôs reaction was disproportionate, but clearly if you aren‚Äôt Black you don‚Äôt understand that misogynoir plays a role in this as well. 

Unless you are Black, you will never understand the kind of scrutiny and mockery that Black women face when it comes to discussions about our hair. For you, it‚Äôs ‚Äújust a joke‚Äù but she has a *medical condition*, and on top of that there is also a whole additional layer of hurt because of the fact that she is a Black woman, and for us, our hair has historically been used to attack and degrade us. 

There was another post here about how Jada should‚Äôve just ‚Äúdefended herself‚Äù and to me, that was especially tone deaf because if you cared enough to understand the plights of Black women in society, you‚Äôd understand that Black women often cannot just ‚Äúdefend themselves‚Äù, whether verbally, physically etc without being labelled an ‚Äúangry black woman‚Äù. In addition, historically Black women (and also indigenous women) are one of the least protected groups in society; we‚Äôve been begging for people to stand up for us and protect us the same way they jump to protect white women, but apparently some of y‚Äôall think we should just fight our own fights and don‚Äôt have a right to protection by others.

It was even more telling when I saw the OP from that post make a comment about how they were ‚Äúfocusing on the misogyny aspect of misogynoir‚Äù which made me realize that a lot of white/non-Black women think that misogynoir can be deconstructed into racism and misogyny, as though you can focus on one aspect while ignoring the other (as OP tried to do in their post) which is NOT HOW IT WORKS. The experience of Black women under misogynoir is a *unique*, compounded experience that cannot be separated or deconstructed just because white women don‚Äôt have the range to understand or listen to us when we explain our experiences.

Furthermore, it‚Äôs interesting that everyone says ‚Äúviolence isn‚Äôt the answer‚Äù and references only Will‚Äôs actions, but did you ever consider that a Black man degrading a Black women in a room full of her peers, about an issue that historically has caused a lot of pain in the Black community was violent? Violence is not only physical and it‚Äôs disappointing seeing a subreddit such as this completely miss that point. Ask yourselves, if Chris Rock made a bad joke about something that affects all women, not just Black women (like reproductive rights etc.) would you not find that violent? So why is it different when Black women are attacked? Also, keep in mind that Chris Rock has a well documented history of attacking Will and Jada specifically, and this seems to be the straw that broke the camels back.

Anyways, I‚Äôve said enough and fully expect to get downvoted to oblivion but my message to white women is: you are out of your depth in this conversation. You‚Äôd do better to sit back and listen to the Black people (especially women) that are discussing this topic, because you simply *do not* have the range you think you do to participate in this conversation.",TwoXChromosomes
1522851670.0,YouTube Shooting - It MUST be a domestic dispute because she's a woman,"I don't know why I'm so frustrated by this, maybe because I believed it at first. All of the reports about this shooting said, ""They believe this shooting is due to a domestic dispute."" As it turns out, no, the woman was mentally ill, was angry at the company, and decided to take extreme measures. Just because the shooter happens to be a woman, doesn't mean she's mad at her boyfriend. The media jumping to 'domestic dispute' first feels like the equivalent of someone saying, ""She's probably on her period.""

I hate when the media jumps to conclusions before having all the information. It's like listening to gossip. Like the time that gentleman was being interviewed, the kids interrupted and the [mom came flying in the room ](https://youtu.be/Mh4f9AYRCZY) to get them. The whole first day, the media said, ""Then the nanny came into the room to grab them."" I kept thinking, how do they know it's not the mom? Turns out it WAS the mom. The media had a hard time believing the white man would be married to a non-white woman. I bet she felt great seeing their cute video posted everywhere just to have the world thinking she's the nanny to her kids.

1416827264.0,My boyfriend [M26] of 7 years just told me he wouldn't marry me [F26] because I've gotten too fat.,"There isn't much more to say than that. My boyfriend, whom I've been with since I was 19, told me he wouldn't marry me 'in my current condition'. I don't know whether to be pissed-off, heart-broken or both. All I know is I feel like complete shit. 


For the longest time, I was the sole earner for us - he was unemployed from October 2011 to December 2012. He could've picked up a job (our city has jobs galore) but instead he cherry-picked the jobs he applied for, all high-paying ones tailored to his area of study in college. I wasn't making enough in retail to support us both, so I got a job with the government - 40hrs/week at a desk. When I get home, I'm usually too tired to go to the gym or walk our dog, stuff I used to do to keep in shape. So yeah, I've some gained weight. Big whoop. I still feel healthy, and I'm comfortable in my own skin. 


We hung out with some friends Saturday, including a friend of his we haven't seen in a while. Turns out he just got engaged to his girlfriend, a girl he's known for 2.5 years. Their wedding is next spring. Can't say hearing that didn't sting a little.


In a moment of emotional drunken stupidity, I questioned him on the ride home. Stuff like ""Do you think we'll ever get married?"". He gave non-commital BS answers, basically sidestepping the questions. ""It's not the right time in my life"" etc, or countering with ""Are you trying to start a fight?"". I kept pressing him and by the time we got home, he was annoyed. He finally whipped his head around at me and barked ""Have you looked in a mirror lately? You steadily gain weight and do nothing to fix it. By next year you could be 300lbs! So no, I haven't thought about marriage. Not in your current condition.""


I realize now I asked inappropriate, totally loaded questions. Definitely not something you discuss when you're drunk. So that's on me. But what he said was an absolute dagger through my heart. I didn't speak another word to him all night. He went to bed, I bawled in the basement until I fell asleep. Normally after I shower in the morning, I'll get changed in front of him. For the first time, I felt completely ashamed and embarassed of my body. I changed in the bathroom.


I went for coffee with my best friend this afternoon to talk about it. She confirmed that it was a total asshole thing for him to say, but also said I'm over-thinking it, don't take it to heart, just eat a bit healthier and that she'd even be my gym buddy. While I appreciate her sentiment, I don't think she gets the point. Do I even want to marry him anymore? Can I be with someone *that* shallow? Beauty fades with age. How am I supposed to be comfortable around him knowing he's judging me so harshly on my looks? I want a husband **for life**, not someone who will dump me when I'm 45 for someone skinnier and more attractive. 


The worst part about it is I **know** he bought me an engagement ring shortly after he got his new job. Through a chance circumstance I came across a receipt for an expensive ring. I thought **for sure** he'd propose in May 2013 when we took our trip to Hawaii. Didn't happen. I was so disappointed but figured he must have something else in mind. After a year and still no proposal, I started to worry. Could this ring be for someone else? I asked his little sister (who I'm close with), she confirmed he bought it for me and she helped pick it out.


So yeah, if I wasn't ""fat"" in his eyes, I'd be engaged and probably married by now. How is that suppose to make me feel? I'm not going to make any rash decisions when I'm this angry and hurt. But I wonder if I should just end it. I want to lose weight now, but honestly it's out of pure resentment. Like leave his ass, work out every day, get totally skinny again and flaunt it in his face. 


I remember he told me once ""I've dated 10's and I've dated 2's; to me, it's what's on the inside that counts"".

1399562370.0,How to normalize women on reddit; or why this subreddit becoming a default is a good thing.,"Hey, ladies and many-more-gents-than-previously.

Maybe this is redundant to make this post, but the other major default discussion thread here contains mostly anxious comments. So I thought I'd put up an alternative point of view.

A lot of the complaints going around are that this subreddit was a safe haven prior to it becoming a more ""publicly accessible"" default. It was a place for women (and men) to speak candidly about certain aspects of their lives. Now, the fear is that this outlet and culture is either bastardized or gone. Potentially vulnerable or sensitive discourse will be open to a wider, more unfamiliar audience than intended.

Well, perhaps the change is a necessary sacrifice. 

reddit has been [called ""anti women"" before](http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2012/07/why-reddit-so-anti-women-epic-reddit-thread-counts-ways/55080/). I think there's some truth to that. With the addition of /r/twoxchromosomes to the defaults, obviously the admins wanted to change the general perception of the site. They want to say that reddit welcomes women. Prior to this, there were no predominately female driven defaults. /r/aww perhaps came the closest, and even that was around a 50/50 distribution, if that.

So. My opinion is that /r/twoxchromosomes *should* change its focus in order to make reddit more open and tolerant, and just plain *more interesting*. Here's why:

- It can now can act as a broad net, catching a large amount of users interested in or curious about women's issues, and then direct them to smaller subreddits if they eventually feel something is lacking here. 

- Female oriented topics will more frequently appear alongside ""general posts."" Eventually, I hope they're normalized here. More men can contribute to the conversation, or just learn to ignore it rather than having a negative reaction from seeing it. Maybe they'll have their views changed through simple exposure.

- When you're showing your friends reddit, you can point Two X as a default directed at women. That wasn't possible before. Then tell them to check out the list of related subreddits, because there *are* many more. 

Of course there are going to be people who fuck with the subreddit. But the mods can handle it. If trolls prove too overwhelming, Two X can always leave the default status.

Really, the point of this post is not what's lost, but what reddit is gaining. In order to change how reddit works, things have to change. I don't know if what I've said above will happen or not, but either way, maybe this will settle once and for all whether or not reddit (*as a whole*) can be open to both genders.

It's worth a shot.

I dunno what it is about 2015, but so far twice this year, complete strangers have felt it perfectly acceptable to come up to me and tell me I'm fat (the first time was on my birthday, wooo!)

They don't see me filling up on veggies or carefully planning balanced meals that keep me and my partner healthy and satisfied. They don't see me drinking tea like a fiend to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings.

There's nothing I can do about the strangers, but I hope that by virtue of being my friend, you all know that everyone is more than just who you see in that moment.

Maybe that person has already lost 40 pounds, maybe they're struggling with an illness or recovering from trauma, maybe they're prioritising school or art. Maybe they're the kindest or funniest person their friends know. Just take that moment to consciously think of something good about that person and their body.

1399459136.0,I am really concerned about my 14 (almost 15) year old sister.,"She's five years younger than me. We didn't have the best family life growing up. Our dad is emotionally and physically abusive, and Claire (my sister) seems to take the brunt of the abuse. My dad loves our youngest sister (Elisa, 12 almost 13) and it's very obvious she's the golden child. My brother (Tim, 13 almost 14) seems to be okay. My parents seem to like him, but since he's a boy they've made him go to work almost every day he's been free, including after school, since he was two years old. I'm not exaggerating about how much he has to go to work on the farm with our dad. He has literally no free time to hang out with friends because he has to work so much. 

Anyway, back to claire. She's quite a bit heavier than us, and my dad never lets her forget that. He makes fat jokes about her daily, which I participated in until I realized how fucked up it was. Tim and Elisa still make fun of claire as far as I know. Example of a joke: we were watching animal planet and there was a whale on a sling that had to be transported to a hospital, and my dad said ""hey look, it's claire."" 

Claire won't hug or touch anyone, or let anyone touch her, which would be fine, but I think it's because she has never felt loved by her parents. She won't even tell anyone she loves them. She's very cold towards others, but I know how much she hurts. I can see it in her face when my dad makes fun of her. The only emotions she ever shows are fear, anger, and sadness. 

She has crippling social anxiety.. She can't even order her own food at restaurants, or check out at a store by herself. She won't go on school field trips or go to field days or anything. She never has friends over or goes to hang out with anyone. My parents told her she can't get a car until she's 21. I told her she can leave my parent's house and live with me when she turns 18, but she said she ""can't just leave,"" as if she has to be stuck there forever or something. 

During one of our dad's ""outbursts"" as I like to call them, Claire called me to tell me what was going on, and I called the police and told them the situation and that there was possibly going to be child abuse if they didn't go get involved and calm him down. The police got there and said there was a ""disturbance of the peace"" call, my dad said everything was fine, and the police left. That made me fucking furious. But I don't think he's had an outburst since, and it's been a year since that. Claire later told me ""thank you for calling the police. I'll go to that stupid therapist thing you were talking about."" Prior to then I had been talking to her about getting mental help. Not that my parents would allow it, but I told her when she's 18 she should go. 

I'm worried about her mental health and how she's going to function in the real world. I don't know what to do in this situation. ",TwoXChromosomes

My boyfriend groped my breasts when approaching quickly from besides me. I was in public (school) and his hands were below the table I was sitting at so other people couldn't see and it would look like a hug.
I have made it very clear to him I am not interested in physical reciprocations of affection, especially in public. 
When he did this, I was too startled/scared/surprised to respond. I kept small talk with him until I left to my first period class, where he briskly grabbed me again and kissed me. I do not like this and I have told this to him before.

The community is amazing and supportive and uplifting, especially for us, because we live in a Deep South town and inhabit a social sphere in which casual sexism is the norm. In our friend group we're a weird pair of liberal outliers, so this subreddit is like a safe house for us, where we feel on the same page with everyone. Thank you for that.

I have two questions (discussion points, really) that I would love your help with:

Speaking as the male counterpart of this relationship, how can I combat the casual sexism that is so frequent among my guy friends? We'll be drinking/talking/etc. and an offhand sort of rape-y comment will be made about someone, or someone will joke about women's place in the kitchen or some other such outdated stereotype. In those situations, my general response is sort like ""What the fuck, dude?"". But I feel like that's not *doing* enough. There's worse shit too, this sort of unspoken disregard for women's opinions, etc. That's even harder to confront.

The obvious response would be to stop associating with people like that, to stop being friends with them altogether. But I have this cognitive dissonance about all that, because even though these comments are *terrible* and plain ignorant, these aren't *bad people*. I feel like any feelings of sexism or racism they harbor are a matter of misinformation that has been engrained. 

I feel like as a dude and a friend, I have a special opportunity and maybe even a responsibility to change some opinions and inform. What would be the best course of action for that?

My second talking point is about the reddit community as a whole. Despite the great communities here and at subreddits like r/NiceGuys and r/Feminism, more and more these days, I see misogynistic vitriol spewed in the comments of otherwise harmless posts on the front page. I see a lot of hate towards feminists and ""Social Justice Warriors"". Right beside that, I'll see a post from r/gifs of some porn star's tits.

1635118350.0,As a trans woman I'm scared of all the growing transmisogyny in the media and the world,"I'm 29. I've been on hormones for about two years. I've never felt like my decision to transition was a mistake, but sometimes I feel like I've sealed my fate in doing so.

I've been paying attention to the media coverage and general reception of the newest Dave Chappelle special and the amount of disgust, vitriol, and contempt I've seen expressed toward trans women has had me feeling sick and fearful. A coworker of mine shared a meme on facebook mocking the Netflix employees involved in the walkout. I posted a comment explaining why the meme's point was flawed, how Chappelle's special was transmisogynistic, and how the Netflix employees aren't even demanding the special be removed (if you look at the demands, they're actually mostly just demanding better trans representation in the future)

She deleted my comment and left the meme up. She hasn't said a word to me.

It's that open contempt, the attitude that she can acceptably mock trans women while me speaking out about it is unacceptable. That attitude is so pervasive.

Margaret Atwood recently shared some very TERF-y articles and talking points on Twitter, and even though the vast majority of responses she got from trans women were very polite and articulate, she chose to paint the response as ""aggressive, in-your-face activism"".

It's like anything trans women say is unacceptable, like we're supposed to say nothing at all and just accept constantly being the world's punching bag and scapegoat.

I don't know what point I wanted to make here. I just look at trans suicide rates and homicide rates, and I look at the way people talk about us constantly, and I just feel so alone and scared. I feel less safe at work than I used to. I constantly feel so judged and belittled. Friends say things are getting better for trans folks but it feels like it's getting worse.",TwoXChromosomes

If you find yourself overreacting to everything and yelling at your loved ones half the time, that's just your personality!  Stop excusing everything you do with your hormonal tales of woe. You might be able to get your boyfriend to shut up and feel bad for you after you treat him like shit, but you don't get any sympathy from me. 

I understand that you can get a little more sensitive emotionally due to PMS. But you're not a child, you should know how to control your reactions. I get sensitive too, but I recognize that and therefore take more time to gauge my reaction and try my best not to let it effect anyone else.

Women who use this excuse are contributing to why many men are so scared of periods and think that women are irrational and moody by nature. Something that happens to you every month shouldn't change you that much. You're a goddamn adult, act like it. 

Sorry for the rant/language, I'm on my period. Hahaha. Nah, I'm just kind of a bitch sometimes.

Yes, too many men are cruel or misogynistic. Far too many. And there are countless other posts and thousands more people who are tired of offended men climbing into their spaces and getting upset on behalf of ""all/most men"" when we're just trying to talk about the pervasive societal or cultural issues with the treatment of women. Or even when we share stories of how we've been hurt or terrorized by people who are men, as if our personal horror stories are somehow targeting them.

But statements like ""all men are XYZ bad thing"" aren't great. I understand the expression of anger at the greater patriarchy, but ""men are xyz"" is unhelpful at BEST. It absolves evil and cruel men of guilt because it sets up the notion that XYZ is just the default state of men, and that's bullshit. Men can be soft, kind, and warm. They can also be cruel, vindictive, and violent -- but the decisions they make are their own. There's no ""base nature"" of cruelty. 

Hold men accountable! Regardless of your gender or lack thereof!

The radfem rhetoric of ""men are evil"" ties a neat little bigoted bow alongside the terf rhetoric of well, all of that bullshit.

1540494096.0,Men are afraid women will laugh at them. Women are afraid men will kill them.,"This quote from the handmaid's tale hits the nail on the head. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. 

Edit: Ok, I really didn't want to make an edit, but now that this is on r/all I feel I have to. I am NOT saying that all men are assaulters. I am not trying to invalidate men who are victims. I am not saying that it's every man's fault that women feel unsafe. I am not even saying that this quote is gospel and never are men afraid of women. 

This is a quote from a TV show that shows a severe situation of female oppression. In the context of the show, yes, all women are afraid of all men because the situation has gotten that depraved. 

This quote struck me as very powerful because, in general, I do believe that women have more fear of men than men do of women. Men are afraid of rejection and being laughed at by women. They can also be afraid of violence from women, but if in general they're more afraid of the former two. Women when they go on dates are told to always watch their drink. To let a friend know your exact situation at all times and even track you on apps specifically for this. To never walk alone at night, always have a buddy. Women are the victims of sexual assault very often. We are the victims of dating violence very often. This does not invalidate those men that are victims. But women are in general more fearful of men than men are of women. This is just how it is. If you can't accept that women have a lot more to fear when going out, then you need to take a hard look at how you view the situation. ",TwoXChromosomes

Listen, I love receiving gifts as much as anyone does. Hostess gifts, thank you gifts, birthday gifts, stocking stuffers - I love them all.  But when I receive a gift in any form that include soap - I immediately get annoyed. 

Now I mainly mean bar soap. The smelly, frilly, decorative kind that women, for whatever reason, feel compelled to gift each other ALL THE TIME. And no - I don't care if you bought it from a high end department store or artisan sap maker at the farmers market. Why? 


For one - it's useless. I don't use bar soap. I don't even know anyone who does. At 30, I already have a pretty established beauty routine, and it doesn't include a slimy, smelly bar of crap that slowly melts away in my shower. And honestly I don't even UNDERSTAND decorative bar soap. Really? Soap as decoration? Why?


For two - it's so uncreative. Nothing says ""I put absolutely zero thought into what you like or who you are as a person. I just picked up the first shitty token gift I could find at World Market to fulfill my obligation to gift you something"" like bar soap does. 

For three - it's a nuisance. Really. I feel obligated to keep it for some reason. But I never will. So it will just sit in my bathroom collecting dust for years until I finally decide to purge and throw it away. And even then I will feel a twinge of guilt doing so. So that thoughtless gift you  spent your hard-earned money on really amounted to more clutter in my house and ultimately more trash in a landfill.


So in closing, can we all just agree to stop giving each other soaps? Please? Because I promise you a $5-10 gift card to Target, Starbucks (or any coffee shop, or - hell I don't care - Home Depot would be more useful and thoughtful than a bar of soap.

1416455334.0,Why do some men seem so offended that feminism doesn‚Äôt address their issues?,"EDIT: I want to rephrase my question as I feel it's a little inflammatory. What I really meant to ask was why *should* feminism be expected to address everyone's struggles? Women face a unique set of difficulties and whilst we've made great strides towards equality in the last century, I believe there is still a place for a movement that deals with the problems they face.

(And I stress, *some* men.)

Feminism is about women‚Äôs issues. It arose to fix a state of inequality and aims to afford women the choices they haven‚Äôt always had access to. And of course the patriarchy affects men negatively too - and I would never diminish men‚Äôs issues, such as unfavourable treatment in family law, higher suicide rates etc - but why do these fall under feminism‚Äôs umbrella? Would you walk into a civil rights group and demand they do something about the homeless white man on the corner? I just find it very tiring to be reading endless threads where somebody mentions feminism and all of a sudden, there's another comment essentially asking, ""Well, what are you doing to help *me*?""

I am a feminist and I believe in equal rights. I believe women still suffer under the current systems set in place. I believe men do too, albeit in different ways. As an individual, I care about the struggles of men and of women.

But I do not understand why specifically feminist organisations are expected to champion both.

I don‚Äôt mean to be an asshole and I don‚Äôt want to come across as the ‚Äúangry Black girl‚Äù do you really care about women‚Äôs reproductive rights? Do you know what‚Äôs happening to women of colour in the United States right now or is it because you‚Äôre suddenly affected that it‚Äôs a major problem?

Watching a lot of you get angry is like a slap in the face, especially when you‚Äôre angry but you‚Äôre not going to do anything but vote or you‚Äôre angry but helpless or you‚Äôre angry and not going to do the work.

1670240235.0,"No, it is not just a personal choice when a man says he wants a traditional marriage.","I came across a post on reddit where a guy said he wanted a traditional marriage, wherein he provides the financial support, while the woman stays home. That left a bad taste in my mouth.

Now, to clarify something, I don't have a problem when a woman makes the choice to stay at home, because at the end of the day that is HER making a choice about HERSELF. Whereas men who say they want their wives to stay at home are making a choice for SOMEONE ELSE. It also screams ""I want someone to take care of all of my other responsibilities as an adult, while I go out there and work 40 hours a week.""

The funny thing is it's always presented as them making some huge sacrifice, when they were going to have to work, married or not. Besides the fact that they use the excuse of ""I've been working all day"" to not do anything at home, as if the wife hasn't been working all day as well. The most frustrating thing is people in the comments telling him that he's entitled to that choice, and plenty of women would agree to that dynamic, Ignoring the fact that historically, that dynamic has left women in more vulnerable situations. I understand that capitalism has made the concept of work unbearable, and that many of us would prefer staying at home than to deal with a shitty boss, but the answer shouldn't be to quit your job and give someone financial power over you.

Because you should understand that, by giving up your job and staying at home, you now hold less power in the couple. You're depending on him, he isn't depending on you. In fact, your individual net worth is dwindling, while he's able to work longer hours and show his dedication to his workplace, and make even more money. And men know that, they know that two incomes are better than one, they know that they could hire a housekeeper or a nanny to manage the kids and household while you're both at work. And eventually the kids grow up and start spending most of their day at school or extra curricular activities. But they choose power, they choose to have you under their mercy, and that's when the abuse begins.

That's why whenever I hear a woman is choosing to stay at home after having kids, I always warn her first, and then respect her choice. I warn her that the bulk of parenting responsibilities will fall on her shoulder, that she won't have the financial freedom she has with a job, that, while he gets to clock in and out of work, and gets weekends and sick days and PTO, and eventually a retirement, she doesn't. That being a SAHM is a 24/7/365 position. And when she makes that choice, even though statistically she's more likely to be screwed, I hope that she's the outlier, and I respectfully offer my support.

But I have no sympathy nor respect for a man who wants an unpaid maid and chef and incubator and nanny, just so he can kick off his shoes at the end of his long work day, and complain about how exhausted he is to a woman whose work day is never over.


EDIT: it seems that many can't get past the example I gave in this post, and keep insisting that, since that guy isn't forcing someone to be a stay-at-home wife, then it's not bad. And that I'm removing his ability to make that choice. Way to miss the point.

The post I read was the catalyst behind this analysis. It is not the only case in which this dynamic plays out. The argument I'm making is : why do these men make this specific choice in the first place? And most importantly, why are there far more men making this choice than women, when more of us are working and providing financially than before? And keep in mind that this ""choice"" is made in a patriarchal world where most women are brought up to think of themselves as mothers and homemakers first. You can not look at that request in any light other than the patriarchal one we all live in.

EDIT 2 : since it bears repeating, saying someone made a personal choice is not enough to make the discussion end. Choices or not, your decisions are not exempt from analysis. So yes, while I can't and shouldn't stop this guy or anyone else from making any choice they want, I still have a right to criticize said choices. 

This post is not me stopping him or anyone else from entering traditional marriages. Last I checked you're still able to do that. But if you really can't tell the difference between criticizing someone's choices, and stopping them from making those choices, then that's on you, not on me.

1422540353.0,I was raped,"


Hi. I wanted to share my story here because of a terrible thing that happened to me this past Saturday. I keep feeling like what happened was somehow my fault because I made an unfortunate decision that I will end up regretting the rest of my life.



I'm a 25 year old woman, and share an apartment with a female roommate who is the same age as I am. This past weekend, my roommate went out of town to visit family, so I was alone for the weekend. On Saturday evening, I went out to a nearby lounge for a drink or two ( and before you get the idea I was intoxicated, I really do mean no more than two drinks) and just to relax. The lounge was fairly crowded, and after sitting at a table for a few minutes, I saw a man walk in that I recognized from my apartment complex. I didn't know him that well (our interaction consisted of saying hello, how are you, and engaging in a minute or so of small talk when we happened to run into each other, and I only knew him by first name). All the tables were occupied, so when he saw me, he walked over and asked if he could share my table. I said sure, so he sat down and we talked for awhile. After awhile, I told him I was a bit tired and I was going to head home. At this point, he asked me if I wanted to come back to his place for awhile so we could continue our conversation. I hesitated, because I really didn't know him that well, but he was being really nice, and hadn't said anything even remotely suggestive, so I was persuaded to go. I told him clearly that I could only stay a little while, and that me being there would be only to talk. He said he understood and that that was just fine, he was enjoying my company.



I got in my car and followed him to his apartment, which turned out to be right down the street from mine. He opened the door, and motioned me inside. I walked in, while he locked the door behind us. No sooner were we inside when he told me to take off my clothes. Thinking he was kidding, I kind of laughed a bit, to which he replied that he wasn't kidding. I told him I was leaving, at which point he grabbed me by the throat and started choking me. I tried to fight him, but he was too strong. He told me to do exactly what he said or he would kill me. He forced me to undress, then he threw me onto a sofa, got on top of me, raped me, forced me to perform oral sex on him, then raped me a second time. When he was finally finished, he got off me and told me I could leave. I grabbed my clothes and ran out the door. I drove the short distance back to my apartment, and ran in, still naked.



After I got over the initial shock, and after crying for what seemed like forever, I managed to pull myself together enough to dress and drive to a nearby hospital to have a rape kit done. He hadn't used protection, so I had to have tests for STD'S and AIDS, and also for possible pregnancy. I still haven't reported the rape to the police, because I'm afraid that since I voluntarily went with him to his apartment, and I had no real bruises to speak of that they would believe that I had consensual sex with him.



Anyway, I am furious with myself for trusting him and providing him with the opportunity to violate me. So, am I right to assign part of the blame to myself? I haven't said anything to my roommate, or my family, because I'm just not feeling up to discussing what happened yet with people I know. Right now, it's just easier to talk about it anonymously with people who don't know who I am.

1301086322.0,"Ugh ladies, I know why women don't lift weights at the gym","So i've been going to my gym about 4 times a week or so and every day i do the same thing: 30 minutes of cardio, 45 minutes lifting, and 15 minutes of abs. And every time i go downstairs to the weight room, i'm the only female, save for the occasional old lady and teenage girl texting more than lifting. 

And every time i'm in the weight room, guys tell me to move, push me out of the way, stand directly in front of me so i can't see the mirror, hog the machines, take my weights etc. 

Examples:

One day i grabbed a free bench to do my lifting - my gym has about 8 of them and there were 6 people downstairs. I started my routine and all 6 guys crowded around me to watch the basketball game on tv -- there are FOUR tvs downstairs. They didn't have to crowd around me to watch the game. They stood there for 10 minutes, not doing anything. I had to ask them repeatedly to move so i wouldn't hit them with my weights. 

One day i picked a corner of the mat in the back to do abs. I started my routine and an old man stands directly behind my head and tells me to move because that's his spot. I looked around the mat and it was empty. He had 18 feet of free space, and he chose to ask me to move. I moved and he sat down for 2 minutes, then left. WTF?

Every time i use a machine, 2 reps in and a guy while pop out of no where to stand right next to me and impatiently stare at me while i'm trying to work out. 

Today i again picked a bench, did my routine and these 5 college-aged guys kept walking in front of me, behind me, bumping into me etc. As usual, i picked a somewhat isolated corner so i could have a little privacy and a part of the mirror to check my stance. They moved in a group and i kept having to ask them to move -- there's a whole freaking empty gym and they decide to stand directly in front of me! They hogged machines so that no one could get on. I had to skip 2 parts of my workout because they wouldn't let me on, even after i asked. After i was done lifting, i saw them all sprawled out on the mat and just gave up. 

I am so frustrated! This is why girls don't lift weights. I don't know what it is. Old guys, young guys....it doesn't matter. It's like they feel entitled to be down there and i'm invading their space. I've noticed that guys don't crowd other guys or ask them to move. It's just me (and whatever other girl happens to be down there at the same time).

**TL;DR Guys keep crowding me (a girl) and pushing me out of the way while i try to lift weights.**

My boyfriend and I don't live together, but I spend the night with him often. We have been dating for almost 2 years and it has truly been great.

1634466173.0,Men's version of gender equality,"This has been getting **on my tits** and I need to rant. 

Recently, in the last few months or so, I've seen tonnes of posts on Twitter, Reddit, etc where men are aghast that women expect men to pay for them on dates. The comments that follow berate these women for being traitors to feminism, not wanting gender equality, etc. 

EDIT : I just want to post out the posts I am referring to are ones where a man is chatting to a girl online and she has told him if they go out she thinks he should pay. They haven‚Äôt met, he hasn‚Äôt been forced to pay, she is stating her preference before they meet. These screenshots are normally uploaded and loads of men flood to them to claim evidence of all women loving the patriachy. I wrote this post as I wanted to offer the roots of why men typically paid for dates, why that hasn‚Äôt necessarily changed and why I don‚Äôt think their behaviours of being aggressive and putting down women for this is justified NOT that they should have to pay for women. Just that if they don‚Äôt want to, move on and let her meet someone who does. 

A few years ago, here in the UK, the wage gap dominated the headlines. The next year, the gap grew smaller. Then, over the pandemic, the gap grew again. Nobody seems to worry about this or think this is unfair. 

I personally wouldn't expect a man to pay for me on a date, but why shouldn't other women? How is it unfair for a man to pay more when he gets paid more? 

It's always flouted as women 'not wanting equality' but nobody ever seems to point out the massive hole in that; that if wages were equal across society then there would be no expectation for a man to pay for a woman. 

[This article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2016/04/13/why-are-men-still-paying-for-women-dates/RT3zjhcqD42cnJdLnOKZEL/story.html) from six years ago offers two reasons why men pay for women on dates 

* 'One interpretation is that the man is basically shelling out for access to sex'
* 'The other explanation is that we‚Äôre witnessing a continued preference for unequal relationships'

The article even considers the wage gap 'Men paying for meals may have made more sense when fewer women worked outside the home ‚Äî and those who did faced a bigger gender wage gap ‚Äî but today, unmarried women earn, on average, [almost as much as single men](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/04/02/the-equal-pay-day-factoid-that-women-make-78-cents-for-every-dollar-earned-by-men/).' 

The source they then quoted showed the wage gap ranging from 5% to 22% (which is slimmer than [the figures for the UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/genderpaygapintheuk/2020), where even women between the ages of 21-29 have a wage gap of 9%) 

Again, I'm not advocating that men should be expected to pay in every instance, but I don't believe that it's antifeminism to want a man to pay. If anything it begins to bridge a divide in wage gaps. 

If we take a middle figure of say, 10%. Are people spending 10% of their income on dates?

Is it just me that this really niggles? It's not even as though men are being forced to pay on these dates either, they can just not go on them, we can't just fix the wage gap.",TwoXChromosomes

So I've been living as a woman for almost three years now, and I've actually had much better luck than I feel most people in my position have. I have incredibly accepting and helpful family and friends, I have a wonderful boyfriend who loves me for me, and I'm perfectly passable. I use the women's dressing room at the gym, at clothing stores, etc, and nobody ever thinks twice about it. It feels right and good, like I'm the way I'm supposed to be.

The issue really starts with other women though. For example, coworkers. My coworkers are the people I probably see the most out of anyone. Sometimes six or seven days a week. I work with a lot of women and while most of the time we talk about things I can relate to, sometimes the talk comes to periods or pregnancy, or just about anything about having a vagina. I can't relate to any of that no matter how desperately i want to. I always tried to play it cool and add minimally to the conversation and pretend to know what i was talking about. 

Recently however I found out that word had somehow gotten around that I was trans and now everybody seems to know. Nobody seems to have a problem with it, but ever since then I realized that a lot of the girls at work seem a little more distant. We don't have as meaningful of conversations, and sometimes if I walk up and they're talking about one of the aforementioned things they'll change the subject to something else. It feels like I'm being treated differently and it hurts. I just want them to see me as one of them, as a part of the group, and I'll never get there.

On top of that there's my own self-made insecurities. I'll be watching a show, any show really, and sometimes when I see a woman, I'll just think ""You're not like that, you can never be that. She's a real woman and you're just a fake. You didn't grow up that way, you're an outsider to women and always will be. They'll never accept you."" It's a horrible feeling but I can never shake it. I feel like I could never be like the other women. Even my surgery and all the hormones in the world won't change that I grew up as a boy.

I really don't know why I'm here telling you all this. I don't know what I advice I expect to get. I think I just needed a safe place to let my feelings out that wasn't in my therapist's office. 

Thank you so much for reading all of this.

I was just curious as to why it seems there is so much hate flowing through 2x. This is a throwaway, hopefully for obvious reasons. Basically my question boils down to why the community here at 2x feels the need to attack any one who questions the content of a post here at 2x. The example I can give you from my own personal experiences would be when I commented on a post saying that starting a screaming match in a bar may not have been the best way to handle a situation. The responses I got where along the lines of ""how dare you invalidate her actions, she had every right to do what she did, you have no place to even talk about this."" While what I said proposed using conversation to resolve the situation, something I think all men and women should strive for, yet I was blasted with hatred for even suggesting such a thing.

1399423026.0,I lied and I need some advice.,"I'm posting here because you ladies are always understanding, I'm sorry that this is not the most relevant post. So growing up, I got into a habit of lying as it was a safe, easy way of diffusing conflict. However now I'm at a point where it is safe to be honest, but my mind still jumps to lying first and I have to deliberately think about it if I'm going to tell the truth. 

So at work I have to apply to register for this federal scheme so I can get this paperwork which is important to doing my job. I had a total mind blank and didn't register before applying for the paperwork, so naturally I got back a polite rejection. 

My boss came in and I told him how I got rejected and would be reapplying, and he asked why. And instead of the sensible ""I forgot to register first"", I said ""I entered my registration number wrong"". I don't even know why I said that. So now I'm worried that this is going to ruin our good working relationship. 

So should I just let it slide and hope he doesn't find out, or should I go to him and tell him I misunderstood and here's the truth, or straight out tell him I lied, apologize, and tell him the truth. I'm just worried that the admin people will call work and he'll be caught out not knowing the whole story. Or I'm worried that my coworker will bring it up with him (if it werent for gossip this town would collapse) and then I'll look even worse.

This community that I sincerely care about is being opened up to a massive audience, the heartfelt stories that I connect with are going to be met with pervy and misogynist comments!

My friend, who is a bit overweight, and I were sitting in our favorite restaurant enjoying coffee and pastries.

My friend is quite confident and just ignored them. 

&#x200B;

One of the D-bags just couldn't contain himself and said something along the lines of ""Hey fatty, how much more are you going tom eat? Aren't you fat enough already?"". Before I could say or do anything, my friend, completely unfazed, did something hilarious. She turned towards them, picked up a large chunk of her pastry with her spoon and slowly stuffed it in her mouth. She began to chew at a comically slow pace, all the while staring at D-bags with eyes wide open. She finished her entire pastry this way, in their faces, showing them just how much she cared about their opinions.

I burst out laughing. The A-hole who had made the comment turned red. The others just smiled/chuckled nervously. A family of 4 (parents and 2 kids) were at a table nearby, they had seen and heard what was going on and the kids began to laugh, before mom shushed them, while trying to control her own laughter.

1467099529.0,"Why ""abortion is murder"" is not a strong argument in favor of banning abortion.","**Edit:** Guys, cool it with the mansplaining. Remember that this is a women's subreddit to discuss women's issues, not /r/Changemyview. Please do try to be more sensitive, and try to familiarize yourself with women's issues BEFORE you enter the debate. I notice a lot of condescension when someone responds with variations of ""It's HER body"". There are victims of sexual assault that post in this sub. Te discussion of their bodies is a very sensitive matter, so please try to be more sensitive when discussing it. 

This is obviously a very sensitive issue, and there are TONS of posters here who have personally been impacted. Discussion is always welcome, but try to avoid the condescension(especially when you're wrong). Women have to deal with enough of that already. I intended this post to be more of a support post for those that may still be struggling with their decision to abort. You might disagree, and that's fine, but please express your disagreement more tactfully. **/edit**

If abortion is indeed killing a human being(as opposed to merely destroying organic tissue), it is still justifiable. It is justifiable because it's self defense.

There is strong precedent in law that killing is justifiable if it would prevent death or grievous bodily harm to one's self - both of which pregnancy can cause. Sure, plenty of pregnancies are without complication, but the majority of women still go to the hospital for delivery. If you get shot and go to the hospital, your chances of surviving are pretty high. However, lethal force is still justified if someone pulls a gun on you. 

One of the fundamental ideas behind law is that it is there to prevent one person from trampling on the rights of others. If unborn infants do indeed have a right to life, that right is not justified if it interferes with a woman's right to be free of grievous bodily harm and potentially a woman's right to life. 

**Edit:** Wow this blew up. For all the people saying it doesn't cause grievous bodily harm, you have to remember that reversible injuries(like fractures) could be considered grievous bodily harm. Some definitions even consider psychological damage to fall under that description. A complication-free pregnancy incapacitates a woman for a prolonged period of time, disrupts her hormones, appetite/body mass, sleep, psychology(not all women are accustomed to that level of pain), and during labor, her VAGINA STRETCHES. See my point about you being very likely to survive a gunshot. A reversible injury is still an injury, and there is still life lost as a result of it. 

As for the sophists splitting hairs over whether or not killing is the same as murder, I'm not going to waste my time rebutting that. The idea behind the argument is much more important than the semantics. Definitions change(just look at what happened with the word ""literally"").

And quit with the downvoting. My post more than contributes to the discussion. I'm sure I've hit a couple nerves(not that I care. If the pro-choice camp is in the right, then restricting abortion violates the woman's right to life and her body. If the pro-life camp is in the right, then the baby loses its right to life.), but disrupting the discussion entirely is not appropriate. If you disagree with me, then please articulate it in the comments section(and if you can, refrain from using sophistry. Sophistry still disrupts the discussion). ",TwoXChromosomes

Actually, my brother was the only one eating. My husband was playing around with his food and I just kept drinking water.

Then it happened. The hockey game was on commercial break and my brother was almost done eating. My husband opened his mouth and told my brother that he was to leave our home.

My husband didn't like people staying in our home. He told me that my brother had to go, even though I didn't want him to. 

My brother is 37. When Mom died, he was with me. When our little sister died, he was with me. I never saw him cry, he was just always happy, goofy and an awesome brother. He even made jokes at the funerals but told me that we'll see them when we die. He promised me we would.

I found him homeless a couple of weeks ago and brought him into our home even though he kept saying no. He never smoked, or did drugs. He just never finished school and found himself unemployed and had gotten lazy. We tried to help but he slept for most of the days he was with us on the couch and ate our food while making jokes.

So 26 year old me sat there at the table. My husband said he could stay the night and we can help him pack up tomorrow. My brother had a couple of more bites left of the final dinner I made him, He never ate it.

He got up and went to wash his hands. I wanted to look up at him but I didn't want to see him sad or cry. He walked to the bathroom and came out a couple of seconds later with his toothbrush. He began to quickly pack up his things in a hurry.

My husband offered to help but he joked around saying his winter gear got fat and couldn't fit anymore in his bags. I could hear the sadness in his voice.

And he walked out saying, ""Thank you... for everything."" I sat there staring at my food the whole time while my husband closed the door and walked my brother out.

Dear Men, the fact that you think 15% of people something happens to once, anecdotally, (""I have a friend who"") are more important than 85-100% of people who are proven to suffer daily is exactly my point.  You think you are more important than women, and that the one time something happened to you is more important, relevant, and worthy. And that's sexism. 

I maintain:

The men posting this are not the ones it has happened to. They aren't scared to be raped, abused, cheated on or cheated out of something. They're afraid of not being able to victimize others and get away with it. (All of you posting ""I have a friend who understands what women go through""...yeah and your friend isn't here hijacking a post about women's rights because if your friend has recieved treatment he  understands that he is in the minority, and that most of his support group and those in treatment with him were female) 

In fact, the VERY FEW men who have had experiences that even come close to what women deal with on a daily basis are much more likely to agree/sympathize. Not none, but EXTREMELY FEW.

The men who tell the ""it happens to men just as often"" lie are playing dumb. I'm so tired of having to pretend I actually believe their lies  and show them the stats over and over.

For better or worse, here it is. 

""Men Experience Domestic Violence too, and there aren't even shelters for men!""

Shelters are funded based on need.  85% of domestic violence victims [are female](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499891/). Or more, depending where you live. 

Abuse numbers have to include non physical forms of domestic violence to include men at all. Women are several times more likely to die, be physically victimized, or be threatened with violence against other family members than men. [Much more likely. ](https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/what-is-domestic-abuse/domestic-abuse-is-a-gendered-crime/)


""Men commit suicide more!""

When a woman shares a rape or abuse story, someone always pops up with this. What are we supposed to take from it? That men are more likely to abuse and kill everyone including themselves? How is it relevant?

I mean even if it wasn't false. But it is. Women are three times [more likely](https://www.verywellmind.com/gender-differences-in-suicide-methods-1067508) to attempt suicide. Men are just more likely to succeed, because they tend to choose more violent means.

""This neighborhood/travel/walking at night is unsafe for EVERYONE not just women!""

False. Of all traficking [victims ](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/12/report-majority-of-trafficking-victims-are-women-and-girls-one-third-children/), 51% are women and 20% are female children. 

CPS is a [main source](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R41878.html) of traficking victims so yes, it's a domestic problem not an overseas one. 


Child protection isnt unsafe for everyone. Homelessness isn't unsafe for everyone. Being in a region of the world where women and girls are [burned to death ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thestar.com/amp/news/world/2014/02/25/students_burned_alive_in_slaughter_at_nigerian_school.html) for going to school   or married off [as children ](https://www.unicef.org/wca/child-marriage#:~:text=Child%20marriage%20is%20a%20human,Africa%20which%20disproportionately%20affect%20girls.&text=Average%20prevalence%20across%20the%20region,reaching%20the%20age%20of%2018)  is not unsafe for every traveller.

It is unsafe for women, and there is a reason we don't talk about men when we talk about these issues. 

If 1 kid has 1 apple and 1 kid has 10 apples, and someone steals 1 apple from each of them, we need advocacy for the kid who is starving, not the kid who lost 10% of his apples. 

""But men are more likely to be homeless!""

Again, only if you deliberately dupe the numbers. The homeless population is 48-51% male. And only 20% or so female. But the third category is families. Most homeless families are led by a female single parent. If you place parents in their gender categories, women are more likely to be homeless.

85% of the victims get less than 50% of the funding, which is why men who control the funding in the shelter system are so likely to jump in FAST when anyone gets too close to a discussion of women and homelessness. They don't want to be scrutinized for under funding women's and family shelters, which is why they started cooking the books to pretend men are more likely to be homeless in the first place. 

To take attention away from the fact that they systematically under fund women's shelters, they make the conversation about men. 

Even women who are technically housed are more likely to be actually homeless. Women who are exchanging sex for housing, who are being trafficked, and who are working in modern indentured servitude  as ""domestic workers"" 

Women are more likely to experience [safety issues](https://www.homelesshub.ca/resource/do-homeless-women-experience-violence) when they are homeless, making it safer to offer one man sex in exchange for housing than to risk daily violent rape, abuse, and death. 


Women are more likely to be discriminated against by [housing providers](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/right-home-report-consultation-human-rights-and-rental-housing-ontario/housing-discrimination-and-individual), despite the fact that landlords and rental blogs often admit that men are more likely to be resonsible for extreme damage to the unit. 

In [this](https://www.financialsamurai.com/is-it-better-to-rent-to-males-or-females/)  (one of many) blogs a landlord displays obvious bias by saying that he has personal and anecdotal evidence with men absolutely destroying units, but he ""once heard somewhere"" that a woman called the landlord to kill a spider. Basically he states that men have caused thousands of dollars worth of destruction to his properties but ""women are whiny"" and to him, that's the same thing. 

There is a difference between actual discrimination and being annoyed that an entire gender has a home or job at all.

""Women lie about men and the rumors destroy their lives!"" 

Women are more likely to experience social [isolation ](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/right-home-report-consultation-human-rights-and-rental-housing-ontario/housing-discrimination-and-individual) and have very few chances to talk to anyone. Men are more likely to be able to spread rumors 

They are also more likely [to lie](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/battle-of-the-sexes-study-shows-men-get-away-with-lies-twice-as-much-as-women/articleshow/72939139.cms), and more likely to value lying as a positive trait. 

And since lying implies some sort of gain, what would women gain by lying about rape? 98% of convicted  rapists [go free. ](https://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/article/why-rapists-are-getting-away-with-it)   The penalty for rape is a slap on the wrist. And police have been well known to [ignore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Callow) overwhelming evidence in rape cases. (I could have made every letter of that sentence a link but that would be overkill)

Even in the case of an absolutely perfect, white teenaged virginal victim and 3 male intervening witnesses at a reputable university a rapist nailed to the wall by evidence got only 3 months in jail because he can swim. (Brock Turner) 

And knowing he had committed the horrible, violent crime the courts decided he had suffered enough. They decided that a man not being able to swim anymore, and people thinking he's a bad person because he's a bad person, is worse than having a broken bottle repeatedly inserted into your anus. 

A woman losing her life or becoming disabled after committing no crime except existing is the same as a man losing his reputation when people find out he is actually a violent psychopath. 

And women are more likely to be re victimized following a previous assault.

Then again I'm not huge into oral so it's not everyday hour long process for us so I suppose it's not much of an annoyance.

I wish that it wasnt considered disgusting or taboo for a woman want to keep her Pubic hair. I have sensitive skin anyways and have a few discoloration from past ingrown hairs, I've had a Brazilian wax once and I broke out that night with like 40 pimples down there. I did not get the  smooth porn star pussy the Internet promised me.

What shocks me as well is how its so expected for women to ""shave that shit"" but all you have to do is poke around and you'll find tons of men who decide to shave their pubes on a whim only to start complaining about the itching, or the ingrown hair, or the cuts, and they'll flat out refuse to put hot wax ""near their dick"" but yet in that same breath they'll denand a woman to have a freshly shaven cooter? After they've seen firsthand the process it can be for some people? 

Right now I'm enjoying my fur and I'm fortunate that in my relationship it isn't an issue and I'm sad for women where it is. My ex used to demand me to shave everyday and I hated it but he'd deny sexual contact if I wasn't baby ass silky. It's hurtful to know there are people out there like him demanding petty shit like that. And it's disheartening to hear men and women alike talk about ""nasty hairy vag"". It makes me feel like I'm an outcast sometines but mostly I just rock it.

So no idea why I posted this except maybe there 1 or 2 ladies out there who are also embracing the hair. I feel so alone in this waxed world!!


Quick Edit:

Well this blew up lol I It's almost 11pm and I just got around to this now.
Apologies if some things were a bit rambly. I wrote this on my phone
while I was waiting in my car before a job interview and just felt like
getting the thoughts outta my head.

First all just so it's clear...I have zero issues with shaved genitals.
If you enjoy them on yourself or others that's awesome. And when
I said ""liberated"" I mainly just meant that I feel good that I have a choice now
that in the past I never really felt like I had. Within the next day or so
I may decide to take a chance and shape it up a bit and trim/shave
the usual areas I shaved before, but it's nice knowing that I don't
really *have* too. I don't feel obligated to have it a certain way at all times.
I'm sorry I didn't express it clearer before!  Also I was just kidding around
about there being only 1 or 2 ladies out there :)

I don't have enough to support it, plus, my career is just kicking off. It's simply not a good time. I used the pill and condoms but somehow it still happened. 


My boyfriend (25) and I agreed before sex that if I were to be pregnant we'd abort. Two years later here we are. He says he can't bear the thought of it and that if I abort he's not sure if we can stay together. I love this guy to death. We were planning on getting married in the next year. That he would break up with me over a clump of (life ruining) cells hurts, but I know he doesn't see it that way. Still I feel cheated that he changed his views. I know it's different when you're actually experiencing it, but still. 


With our income combined we make over six figures, so whenever I say we can't afford it he brings that up. But ideally I'd want to have much much more in my savings before bringing a kid in the world. Plus like I said, the timing is awful. I'm not ready to be a parent. Three-four years-sure. Now-no. 



I'm very conflicted because I really want an abortion but I also love my boyfriend deeply. I try to explain to him why I'm not ready for a kid but he remains steadfast.



 On top of worrying about my relationship's future I also have to worry about getting the actual abortion, because my parents are pro-life and I don't really feel comfortable asking my friends to go with me to something like this. My boyfriend refuses to go. I can't go alone, since I'm getting anesthesia (unless I wait in the hospital for hours while it wears off.) I at least want him there with me, but he absolutely refuses. 



Sorry if this is jumbled, I'm pretty stressed. I feel like the clock is ticking and on one hand I want to get on with my life asap, but on the other hand I don't want to hurt my boyfriend, who I thought I'd spend my life with. Help?

-He says if I abort we'll probably break up because the thought of it disturbs him so much. I say I just can't have a child now.

1435172527.0,"My boyfriend told me his deep, dark, secret and I'm not sure I can support him after. Help?","This is a really, really touch-y situation and I honestly don't know how to approach it. I've changed some details and am posting via a throwaway because I'm ashamed and embarrassed that this is where I'm at. 

I'm 24 and my boyfriend, Michael, is 28. We've been together for just about 2 years. He is smart, ambitious, successful, handsome, funny, charming and really everything I could ask for. We've had a really great relationship and I love him. 

Michael drunkenly told me 6 months into us dating, that he had a huge secret from college that he wanted to tell me but couldn't. I remember saying if he wanted to tell me, I would never judge him, and I'd be there for him and tried not to pressure him. It's come up a few times since then, and I've never pried and tried to be just like supportive. But it's been in the back of my head. Like how could it not be? 

We've had some minor fights but nothing as awful as cheating or anything like that. He has lied about some stuff and been kind of a hypocrite. Our worst fight was about two months ago, when I found out he did coke with some college friends who were visiting. He has always been very anti-drug and would scold me if I would smoke weed with friends. And then he was doing coke. He denied it and denied it, until he finally admitted it. 

I'm not like repeating this to make him look bad. Like I get we all have our weak moments and I'm not even upset about the partying... it was that he lied about everything and was a hypocrite. That happened with Michael's college friends, so it kinda made me nervous about his college secret. 

The other thing that has scared me is it's like the one thing that he never shares or talks about. Like it's the big, bad wolf. So I started to just like worry about that and stress about it so much, and it started to take a toll on our relationship. There were other things going on that made things tough, but I was just so paranoid and scared about that. 

I asked him to tell me what happened, and promised him I wouldn't judge him and I'd support him and I just wanted to know so we could be closer and not have secrets. And I meant that when I said it. 

So, he told me. And it was *bad*. 

I don't know how else to say it, but it was really, really bad. 

He told me that he was investigated for rape when he was a junior in college. He didn't say he didn't rape the girl, or that she was a liar or dramatic. He said things went further than they should have and he made mistakes, but didn't say he didn't do anything wrong. This might sound like semantics, but he is really, really deliberate and isn't vague. It's just like something that isn't him. If he is vague, it's for a reason. 

The girl didn't press charges, but filed a complaint with the school and he was investigated and initially found to be responsible, and expelled. He didn't tell his family when it all was happening, and only told them after that decision. I guess they were able to talk to someone and were told have an attorney, even for the student discipline board, and they appealed and had the decision reversed. He was again vague, but the impression he gave was they were able to show that she was communicating with him after whatever happened, and raise questions about her credibility. 

I should say, I'm a survivor myself and I want to be a prosecutor. I'm starting Law School in the Fall and what happened to me, changed my life. I didn't press charges, because I was scared, but I couldn't imagine having the courage to file a complaint and then losing. Especially, if something happened. I've been around women that have been hurt, and I feel like I can tell if someone is making something up and not. 

And Michael scared me because he didn't deny things in the way I would want to hear. Not it was all bullshit, it was a set-up, but in a more it got out of hand and I'm not proud of it and I made mistakes. But you can't mistakenly rape someone. THAT IS NOT A MISTAKE. 

There are things with us too, where he is so controlling at times and so firm. In our relationship, it works but it was an adjustment. I just look at it differently with this accusation. It changes how I feel about him. 

I want to say I love you baby, it'll be okay. But I want to talk to the girl. She needs help. Not him. 

When he told me, I was just in shock. I tried to like be polite, and go through the motions but I feel like a zombie 24 hours later. Like what. Is this my life? 

I honestly don't know if I can do this. I feel weird with the idea of sleeping next to someone who could do something like that. I want him to say I'm innocent. Nothing happened. Not like mistakes were made. That isn't reassuring. 

Does it mean I don't love him, because I can't support him like I should after this? I just don't know what to do, and there is no one I can talk to about this without changing how they feel about Michael. So I'm just hoping for someone to listen and maybe give some advice. Thank You.

Although some are whispering in my ear to simply leave without notice, I don't think I could do that unless it got way out of hand. Thank you so much for your kind and reassuring words. Telling him is going to be hard but I'm going to do it after my interview if it goes well. Thank you all again. I feel much better putting it all on the table and really analyzing the situation.

I was going to post in /r/LawFirms, but now I am terrified that he uses this site and goes on that subreddit. He has made me paranoid.

It's one guy. Somehow he has been running his firm by himself for months. I was hired spontaneously despite my utter lack of experience (I have education, but no practice). I know that it's important to not make mistakes since we're dealing with clients and court, but every time I make even a very minor mistake that would take a second to correct, he flips. He does not give constructive criticism, he tells me in a very annoyed/angry tone that I need to ""pay attention and get it together"" and by him having to fix my mistake (he makes me get out of my chair to fix it even though I tell him I can type it in but then he says he can't trust me) I'm wasting his time and then goes on a lecture of either how much other stuff he needs to do or why his system works.

He told me in the beginning that the people before me had quit on him. Now I find out he fired them. His whole team. At a law firm.

Also, he's paranoid. He goes on how other firms are jealous of him being able to do so much by himself so they're hiring people to call us and set up consultations they'll never commit to and ""waste his time"".

I am constantly on edge. I have only worked there less than a month, but I have never felt so stressed out in my life. I feel like I am making all of these mistakes because I am so terrified of making mistakes. I know my memory isn't that bad but for some reason when he gives me the simplest of instructions I completely freeze up.

Are most firms like this? There are other things I don't agree with, such as he is SO rude to people on the phone and cusses in front of clients. He does get the cases done, and he is rated very well, but the inside goings on just don't fit well with me.

I was paranoid that it was because I wasn't fit for this kind of job, and was bummed because I've wanted to work in a family law firm for a very long time.

1419244881.0,"I just had the worst time on reddit. People were mean. It shouldn't bother me, but it does.","I'm a biologist who happens to be a woman.  (I'm the only female biologist where I work.) 
I posted in a subreddit about aggression being part of the evolution of all primates, but that it is something we have to rise above from a social standpoint.. that is *normal* for all primates to be aggressive, but it is not *acceptable* for humans to show aggression. And I was proud to be able to cite genetic research that has identified the genetic markers for aggression as we map the human genome, and other research such as the Russian Fox experiment which supports how *strongly* aggression is attached to animal genetic code.  But I got mocked for it, very aggressively, from women.  This depressed me, because it happens in every social setting I'm in, it seems.

I am proud of being a biologist.  I never get any flack from men I work with, I love what I do.  I get to muck about in swamps sometimes, but its always fascinating.   But when I talk from a scientific standpoint to other women, I seem to fuck it all up so I have no women friends at work.  They won't even talk to me.  I have had women YELL at me..I'll explain one instance.

A lab clerk where I work complained to me about men staring at her. I nodded because I get that, but I took the time to explain the biology to her;  that we are the product of 2 MILLION years of evolution as hominids and just like all other animals we have developed evolutionary attractions...attractions that are JUST just like red baboon assess and peacock tails.  Human attractions are more subtle and varied, but they are also evolutionary.

She got very angry with me and said that men needed to change, and I said they can't really, and I kind of chuckled and said..that we can't change our attractions, if we could then gay conversion camps would work.  And she literally screamed at me for a few minutes and walked out.  And she got all the support staff (mostly women) angry at me from that, but I haven't done well with any of them before that either. 

If it weren't for the men where I work, I don't know what I would do.   

I know Im just venting.  I have a scientific background and I feel I really have a lot to contribute as science explains so much about our human behaviors.  Our two million years of evolution has given us parallels to other mammals from how we form social groups (prides/packs/herds/flocks) that we should look at *biologically* to battle exclusion and promote diversity, to our competitive behaviors (that we should look at biologically to battle bullying) to nurturing behaviors of females, to the need for men to evolve to fight to protect the clan/tribe/family, and subsequently suppress strong emotion to be able to do that for survival.

But I get such shit in life (and on reddit and facebook etc.)  for being smart.  for thinking.  for not jumping on hive mind bandwagons.  And I hate it.  And its the women.  If I said to a man complaining about his wife going crazy, *'well, women get crazy because of their chemicals that affect mood, and they can't help those'*  they get it.   But if I explain to a woman complaining that her man isn't forthcoming with his emotions, and say '*men did not evolve nurturing behaviors as women did, they evolved aggressive behaviors to protect the family groupings to survive'*, yeah, I'm blackballed by every woman that gets gossiped to.

I don't want to NOT be true to myself and to science.  But I have no woman friends because of it.  I don't date men where I work, and I do have male friends at work, except I want women friends.  But I'd rather be in army boots mucking about in the swamp than going to a club in high heels.  I don't feel the need to wear much makeup, I don't do fashion.  I know that Twilight was a book>movie, and that's it.  

I don't know what to do now.  I'm shunned by the women at work.  Do I tone it down?  Change to fit in?  Nod and pretend?  *yes, you're right, your man is being a shit, never mind his 2 million years of evolution that makes his head swivel when he sees a big pair of breasts walk by.  I'll support you in sisterhood even though you're coming down on him for his evolution.*  

**TL;DR** Scientific-minded female socially shunned by other females in all social groupings she belongs to, feeling depressed because it seems I have to make a choice to pretend science doesn't matter in order to get along with other women.

We were both lifeguards at a pool. He was a punk with a Dead Kennedys tattoo and a lot of personality. I was just a quiet, smart girl I guess. We'd only been going out for a month or so. He was only the second guy I'd ever dated. One day, I was sleeping over at his place for some reason. My home life was pretty bad, so I honestly just preferred sleeping on anyone's couch if I could. 
Anyway, we laid down in his bed, and he kind of started spooning me from behind. Then without asking or anything, I'm not even sure how it happened, he slid his fingers in my vagina (we'd never even played around with handjobs/oral at all before this). My brain kind of panicked and froze, and I just froze physically. He said some things like ""oh yeah, you're ready"" and then his penis was in me and he just started fucking me while I laid there frozen. I didn't say anything, I didn't even move. Then he fell asleep and I silently cried a little bit, and then fell asleep at some point I guess. 
It wasn't violent, and he was ""my boyfriend"" at the time, so I kind of felt like I should have wanted to do it as his ""girlfriend""... but it just happened so fast, and I didn't say ""no"" or stop him physically... so I never thought of it as rape. But I felt sad and disgusting afterwards.
It's weird, I actually kept dating him for a little while. I think he did it one more time. I've sort of blocked the whole thing out of my mind and it's hard to remember now. I broke up with him at around two months, and I tried to be very nice about it, but he ended up getting really angry and being really horrible and jealous with me. He threatened the next boyfriend I had. 
Um, it took me a really long time to realize that I'd been, uh, raped I guess. I have trouble labelling it like that. Part of the problem for me is that it didn't fit the typical ""mould"" of rape. I'd never been against sex, and I'd definitely been interested in having sex with someone at some point. But I didn't want to do it with him, and I think that is the real point. For a long time since then, I've had a lot of trouble getting pleasure from sex. I tended to just ""freeze up"" every time, and it is only now that I've realized that it could have been due to my first experience. 

I'm sorry this is so long. Honestly, the biggest thing I am upset about is that I have struggled to have healthy sexual relationships for a long time. I am a sexual person, and I want to enjoy sex. I guess I am hoping for any empathy, or thoughts and opinions, or advice. 
Please and thank you!

***
Edit 9/29/14: 
I guess I didn't make some things clear:
1) I'm not trying to convict the guy.
2) I'd never had sex before. He knew that. We were wearing clothes. 
3) By ""kept dating for a little while"" I meant 2 weeks. We dated for 2 months total.  
4) ""Freezing"" was not a choice. 

P.S. Thanks for the amazing support. I feel a lot better, and a lot less like I've been ignoring a part of my past for a really long time!

And yeah, this is in civil court not criminal so the burden of proof is lower, but the way libel law works in the UK means the Sun had a really high hurdle to clear before winning the case. 

For so many of the situations he denies, he later admits to being blackout drunk and doesn‚Äôt actually remember. He admits to not having read his own witness statement which is insane. It‚Äôs all in his texts, he admits to alcohol and drug abuse far from what he originally submitted in evidence. 

He‚Äôs friends with Marylin Manson which in and of itself isn‚Äôt damning (maybe he just didn‚Äôt know) but to me adds to the picture overall - Depp is not the woman-respecting Southern gentleman he wants you to believe. 

He says he lost our on Fantastic Beasts because of Amber, but that‚Äôs not even true, he only lost it after he lost his UK court case. If he hadn‚Äôt sued, we wouldn‚Äôt know all we know today from the evidence of that case.

No matter what women do, it's considered sexual to some guys.

Be short? Be tall? Be big? Be thin? Be *super* thin? Eat a lot? Eat little? Be clumsy? Be skilled? Be smart? Be not so smart? Be stereotypically girly? Be stereotypically boyish? Have a high voice? Have a low voice?

It's all sexualized. It's all some guy's fetish.

Even our private bodily functions are sexualized. If we dress in cute clothes it is sexualized, but if we dress like nuns that's sexualized too. If we look 13 that's sexualized, but if we look middle-aged that's sexualized too. From head to toes, every part of our body is some guy's fetish.

Tomorrow I'm going to the city to have a late term abortion, and I'm extremely scared.","**TL;DR:** Found out I'm 23 weeks pregnant. Because life seems to get the best of me, I am carrying not one, but two babies. I made the decision to abort the pregnancies, and I am seeking advice from anyone who has undergone a late term abortion. I'm so insanely scared right now!!!


Well ladies, I don't know how I've managed to ignore the symptoms for 23 weeks (apparently I conceived June 30?), but I'm pregnant. I. am. FREAKING. OUT.


And not in a good way. I'm 22 years old, in school, and have a lot of other exciting and awesome things (like my boyfriend, Hunter) going on in my life. Hunter is THE BEST thing to ever happen in my life; I love him in a way that I can't really explain with words. He is, undoubtedly, my ""knight on the white horse."" My plans for the future consisted of him and me traveling the world together, and I am really looking forward to spending all of our money on things like a nice farm in the countryside, charitable causes, and cruises...because we weren't planning on having children.


But today, our Double Income No Kids dreams were shattered after a trip to Planned Parenthood. Hunter had been insisting that for months, I was not pregnant. And there were lots of symptoms to prove him otherwise, too, I just was in such a deep state of denial that I simply could not accept the fact that yes, the missed periods weren't because of my ovarian cyst (I've never had regular periods, anyway). No, the nausea and vomiting was not from mixing my prescription meds with alcohol the night before. I took a test about a month after the conception date, and it came up negative. So, I was convinced that I was not pregnant. I ignored my instincts to test again. WHAT was wrong with me?!


God, thinking back now, how could I have been so foolish? My boobs hurt all the time, they became MASSIVE. I wasn't losing weight despite being on a low carb diet, and I actually gained weight. So many symptoms were brushed aside and disregarded because they just weren't that severe. I had relatively few symptoms, but now I can see how, yes, I am FUCKING PREGNANT.


I'm sure many of you have been in the same situation, probably not as far along as I am - a week away and I would not be able to have made the decision I made: I chose to have an abortion, a procedure which I am having done tomorrow. I am traveling to the nearest city for my appointment, which will take 5-6 hours each day for the next two days. 


Luckily, I have an amazing boyfriend who treats me like a queen, and a mother who was been (surprisingly) very supportive. We have to stay in the city overnight so we are renting a hotel room, which my mother offered to purchase. I'm so grateful to her, to Hunter, and to have a plan as solid as this. I'm just so damn scared right now. 


I'm mostly scared of the pain. I don't know what it's going to feel like, or how intense the pain will be. I have to deliver two mango-sized lumps of cells out of my hooch, which is a cause for great concern as well. Has anyone in the community ever had a late term abortion? I'm so scared. Any words of advice would be so greatly appreciated. I'm not sure why I've stopped crying already. Frankly, I'm not sure why I'm not screaming and tearing my hair out. I'm so strangely calm when in actuality my life is in worst case scenario mode. 


P.S. To those of you amazing gals that chose to keep your pregnancies, despite all odds, you da real MVP. Seriously. I could not imagine accepting responsibilities of another human - uh, make that TWO humans - at this point in my life. Shit's crazy.

I don't have any unbiased people to talk to. I told my current so, and he already hated him so... well.

I was with my last boyfriend for 5 years. In those years I became less of me. He was emotionally and mentally manipulative and abusive. I recognise that now. That isn't my question.

The last 2 sexual encounters, I did not want. I said no. The first time I said no and pushed on him to try to push him off of me. It didn't work. So I just stared at the wall until.he was done. Then he said ""I don't think you enjoyed that as much as me"" and hopped in the shower. I felt used and disgusting.  The next time I said no. I was completely dry but he kept going. I started yelling at him that he was hurting me. And he kept going. I yelled at.him. I told him not to come inside me. I told him he was.hurting me. He came inside me. I felt disgusting and wanted to cry. 

I broke up with him about a month later. After he tried to climb in the shower with me.

1423722945.0,"Given their diet and where they lived, there's no way Amazonian warrior women were giants. The colonial soldiers who got womped just made that up to save face. xpost r/showerthoughts","I was told I should share this here. I'm referring to the warrior women of the Amazon basin, not the Amazons of Greek mythology.  

I'm writing a historical geography of the Amazon basin that aims to uncover the half of human history that has been suppressed by patriarchal scholarship practices.  It isn't easy, since we are coming out of a 500-year period in which women in the Euro-American world have been (largely, not entirely) barred from writing history, or those who have written history have had their texts suppressed, or women have been written out of a good many historical narratives.    

So here's the story.  

In 1541,  Francisco de Orellana was exploring the rivers in what we now call the Amazon river basin.  He encountered in a place called Nhamunda a group of women warriors who did not welcome the presence of he and his expedition team.  They attacked, and Orellana and his team fled in order to save their lives, leaving behind provisions and indigenous people that they had pressed into service.  These women became the stuff of legend when Orellana's chronicler Friar Gaspar Carvajal dubbed them 'the amazons,' in reference to the Greek myths.

The idea that somewhere deep in the Amazon a tribe of giant warrior women fiercely defended their land and territory spread quickly among the imperial Spanish and Portuguese officers. No where in historical texts have I found efforts to paint a more accurate picture of who these women were or what they actually looked like.  

But given the diet of the region, it is extremely unlikely that women would be any taller than the average indigenous woman today, which ranges from four to five feet in height.  

Given that narratives of indigenous inhabitants at the time focused almost entirely on perceived weaknesses and deficiencies (in order to justify colonial domination), it is extremely unlikely that an imperial officer would have returned with an account of having lost human and material resources to people composed entirely of what the conquistadors viewed as the subordinate race/gender. Promotion and financing for future expeditions depended on successful reports or satisfactory explanations of hardship or failure. While it would be disastrous to one's career prospects to report narrowly surviving an attack by indigenous people, it would have been disastrous AND disgraceful to report that these indigenous warriors were petite women.  

This provokes some further questions about the 'work' that the Amazonian myth continues to do in contemporary culture.  By propagating the idea that fierce warrior women were abnormally tall or possessed other mythical characteristics, we are also propagating the idea that ordinary women cannot be fierce enough to successfully defend their own space and people.  It is downright insidious when you think about it. 

Although this is simply a hypothesis based on a historical reading of fragmented records, the idea that colonial officer would lie about the stature of warrior women in order to save face is compelling enough to warrant further analysis.  I'll be examining Spanish and Portuguese imperial records in much greater detail over the coming months in order to see if this hypothesis is sound, and will report back with what I find out!

1629489013.0,"I need to talk about why the recent OnlyFans decision is really, really bad","I am one of the sex workers currently being deplatformed by OnlyFans. I‚Äôve been doing sex work and creating adult content for almost a year, and while I‚Äôm not one of the top earners, I‚Äôve consistently been in the top 20% on the platform. It has been super weird to see news reports about this, since this is not something I share with people in real life. I‚Äôm so frustrated with what‚Äôs happening, and I need to share so I don‚Äôt just go outside and scream. 

Sex work isn‚Äôt just about pornography. For those of us who do this work (and it is work), it‚Äôs about freedom, autonomy, and survival. It‚Äôs about connection and community. Even more, sex work is a matter of disability, LGBTQIA, gender, and economic justice. 

OnlyFan‚Äôs recent decision to ban sexually explicit content will have consequences that aren‚Äôt being covered. I also think it‚Äôs hilarious that they want to differentiate between nudity (which will be ok) and sexually explicit stuff. It‚Äôs not that I think nudity is inherently sexual, but I am curious to see how they slice that.

The thing is, OF changed the game. It‚Äôs business model allows for monthly subscriptions, as well as income from Pay Per View (PPV) posts, and tips. Compared to other sites that host adult content, OnlyFans has a sleek and familiar feel with posts showing up on a social media style feed. The chatting function, while occasionally buggy, provides a way for sex workers to connect with their fans quickly and easily. 

Combined with an enormous user base and great brand recognition, OnlyFans has been many content creator‚Äôs top choice. The presence of well known adult industry performers helped to legitimize sex work on the site, and also gave those workers the chance to generate income apart from studios or production companies. These things have made OnlyFans a relatively safe choice for sex workers at all levels of experience.

I‚Äôm a part of several online communities and group chats where sex workers connect with each other. The fear in these spaces is palpable. Will our subscribers follow us to a new platform? Will we be able to build a new audience? Will we be able to pay the bills?

The money that flows through OnlyFans pays rent, feeds families, and buys school supplies. Many of my fellow sex workers are parents, and the flexibility that sex work allows has been a lifeline throughout the pandemic.

The mean spirited memes circulating about girls at the McDonald‚Äôs getting hotter are feeding an incorrect perception about who is being affected by this deplatforming. And, to be clear, it‚Äôs also wrong for people like the girls in those memes to be kicked off platforms, too. The truth is that OnlyFans content creators are incredibly diverse across spectrums of race, age, gender expression, sexual orientation, body type, and the kind of content and services provided. 

With all of our diversity, however, it‚Äôs fair to say that a vast majority of OnlyFans sex workers are people who are not cis men. In other words, most of us are  cis women, femme, trans, and nonbinary. Plenty of us are queer, and I‚Äôve found a surprising number of sex workers (myself included) to be disabled. I don't have numbers, but lots of sex workers are black, Indigenous, and women of color.

When OF deplatforms us, they‚Äôre not kicking just kicking off the stereotypical Insta influencer creators. They‚Äôre hurting people who are already marginalized, who have already been struggling (especially with the pandemic), and people who are already at a greater risk of unemployment, homelessness, and systemic violence. 

Like so many other creators, I got started during the pandemic. Before Covid hit, I had struggled with employment due to having endometriosis and C-PTSD. These are both chronic conditions that make it difficult to show up to work and keep a vanilla job. Other sex workers I‚Äôm connected with have conditions that similarly impair employment, such as Bipolar Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue. 

Sex work, and specifically OnlyFans, provided a way to generate income that we could do on our own terms; within the limits of our schedules, family obligations, and our physical and mental boundaries. While other platforms for explicit content exist (and will surely be growing in the next few weeks), this instability will be devastating for many of us.

This decision doesn‚Äôt just hurt sex workers, either. By making it harder to access content that is being made by verified, consenting adults, the people looking for this material will be forced back to places that may not have verification policies in place. (Yes, the recent BBC investigation did uncover where these policies are deeply flawed. But still, they exist).

People come to OnlyFans for lots of reasons. For many of my subscribers, being able to chat and explore different fantasies has been a big part of the draw. Sometimes these fantasies are pretty mainstream, and sometimes they‚Äôre not. Sometimes these are things they don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing with their spouse or partner. In so many cases, having a platform to talk, connect, share, and explore has been a positive thing.

With all the current hubbub about OF, it's frustrating that these stories are getting brushed aside. So, thank you for reading.",TwoXChromosomes
1545087926.0,Why some men reject the idea of consent...,"I feel like many men argue the topic of consent so hard for two main reasons. 

1. They don‚Äôt want things to change. Now if they have sex, they have to make SURE the girl actually wants it. They have to make SURE she isn‚Äôt freezing or uncomfortable. They have to make SURE she‚Äôs not too drunk. Before they could just do it and if she felt she was taken advantage of, well that‚Äôs her fault. They don‚Äôt want things to change because it might mean less sex for them. 

2. It means they‚Äôd have to admit they did something wrong or questionable in their past. I can tell you right now, of all the hookups I had in college, I would say 80% were gray area. And almost all my girlfriends could honestly say the same. I was either clearly too drunk, not into it, badgered tirelessly until I just wanted to get it over with, or I flat out said I do not want to have sex only for them to do it anyway. I‚Äôm not saying those things were rape or I should report them, I‚Äôm just saying they were things that are just now starting to be frowned upon. I feel as though a lot of guys argue what is and isn‚Äôt consent because they‚Äôve done some of those questionable things. It‚Äôs hard admitting you‚Äôve done something wrong, so instead they try to justify and defend it. 


The idea of consent is simple and makes sex more safe and fun. Why wouldn‚Äôt everyone be onboard? Easy. Because it means less sex and it means they have to admit they‚Äôve done something wrong. 

Here‚Äôs my opinion, and it might be controversial, but it‚Äôs okay that you‚Äôve done something wrong. Back when I was in college (2009-2013) consent wasn‚Äôt a thing. I mean, it was a thing, but it wasn‚Äôt talked about. I didn‚Äôt know those guys were doing something wrong and they didn‚Äôt know what they were doing was wrong. I‚Äôve met guys nowadays who admit they used to be that way, but they‚Äôve changed and are pro-consent and do everything in their power to make sure a girl is comfortable with sex. I respect the hell out of a guy who can admit that. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm sort of rambling now. I just wanted to get some opinions on this topic. And I want to be clear that I do NOT think all guys are bad or against consent. I‚Äôm just saying, it‚Äôs hard to argue that there isn‚Äôt a large crop of guys who seems to belittle every woman who comes forward and say this whole consent thing is BS. ",TwoXChromosomes

""I imagine he is implying that he has unknowingly perpetuated the problems surrounding sexual assault by perhaps laughing at an abusive joke as a 14 year old, or not intervening when someone needed help. OP said she doesn't think he ever assaulted anyone; she's commending him for taking (and for encouraging others to take) a good hard look at all their previous actions to consider how to make this world a safer place for everyone except rapists.""

He's not saying he's sexually assaulted or harassed anyone or that every man has. He's saying exactly what the paragraph above says and is recognizing a societal problem that allows this kind of thing to happen.  Ever been somewhere where you've seen men or women getting harassed and done nothing about it? Said nothing about it? Laughed at a stupid joke in high school or turned the other way? Kept your head down and said ""I'm glad it's not me?"" I know I have, and I'm a woman.  I think the problem goes both ways - extends to men and women and all forms of sexuality.  It's a problem NOT exclusive to men, but I don't think men, especially, think about how many women around them have been affected by harassment.

It's not just some guy jumping out of the bushes or ambushing you. It's a regular thing that happens subtly, and not just to women.  Often people - and you see this with politicians - are able to form a better sense of empathy when they can associate something they don't think about or understand with someone they personally know, which is why the magnitude of the ""me too"" comments and hashtags, etc., are designed to make an impact.

Hi everyone,


I am absolutely seething and raging right now and I need to vent and this seems like a supportive subreddit for what I need to vent about. I shared this on social media, but the part I couldn't share was the reason I am so enraged is that I am a victim of rape (twice over) and to hear how little a university campus is doing to protect their students makes me want to scream and cry.


Here's what I posted on social media about the [Fifth Estate Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftsvr9i6VTY) about the sexual assaults occurring on the University of British Columbia campus.


At some point, Dmitry Mordvinov ADMITS (more than once) to one of the assaults, and construes it as a ""mistake"" that he ""regrets"". Let's pause for a second and talk about that:
He admits to the assault, and assumes that reaching out with regret and apologies will make the situation better. But wait! There's more: he e-mails the victim's friends and says:


>I need someone asking (her) what I could possibly do to make amends. I was thinking that I could donate to a women's organization of (her) choice - to make at least some of the pain mean something.


Gee golly! Thank you predator for apologizing for destroying this woman's sense of safety in the world, violating her body and taking away her right to consent. BUT IT'S OKAY GUYS BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO DONATE TO CHARITY TO MAKE IT MEAN SOMETHING.


Not only does he admit to it, offer ""retribution"" to make his assault not be in vain, he also tries to excuse his behaviour by blaming Canada's laws - not his moral compass. He states he was confused that in Canada a person cannot consent while intoxicated. Does this mean he's saying that he wouldn't see anything wrong with what he'd done if it weren't illegal?


But wait, let's backtrack for a minute... Remember when UBC decided not address the concerns and reports made by the victims? That's right. Even after he's admitted to it, even after there have been 6 reports (and this number does not include anyone who may not have come forward), UBC still decides to stick their head in the sand. Students even petitioned the university to look into it, and they told the victims that this was bordering on harassment towards the predator as there was no ""proof"". Because readily admitting it doesn't constitute as proof?


It wasn't even until the documentary was aired that UBC made a public apology online to the ""women in these cases who feel they have been let down by our university"". First of all, they couldn't apologize to the victims directly, they had to do it publicly after their reputation was put on the line. Secondly: The women who FEEL they have been let down? It's not that the women have been let down by the university, they just feel that way. This is another way for UBC to shift blame and refute responsibility for their role in what is happening on THEIR campus by using manipulative language.


In case anyone wonders why people hesitate to come forward when they are sexually assaulted - look how many times these women have been turned away, the hoops they've had to jump through to be heard, and how often they've had to defend the truth of what has happened to them. It's traumatizing enough to be sexually assaulted, but these women are re-traumatized every time they have to re-tell their story, every time they have to confront someone who is dismissing them or telling them they are overreacting.",TwoXChromosomes

1402236973.0,[TW] I was taken advantage of by my boyfriend while drunk and I don't know how to feel.,"19 F/M.

He and I went to a party at his friend's house. I got very, very drunk. I don't remember most of the walk/train ride back, or what I said, anything. Just little snippets of the walking. After the friends we were with went home, we went back to his house. I don't remember much at this point, except kinda ""coming to"" and he was inside of me. And then after, when he said, ""Oh my god, I just raped you."" I assured him he didn't and he dropped me off at home.

Waking up in the morning, I couldn't remember much of anything. Later in the day, we were talking about it. He sounds very, very remorseful. ""I've wanted to vomit all day. I hate myself. I shouldn't have done that. I'm so sorry.""

I tell him that I really can't believe that he'd do that, but when I think about it, this has happened before, just not to this magnitude. This was just the most... rape-y of them. The other day he pulled down my pants, I thought he was going to finger me or something, but surprise penis! 

At the root of it, he's a very horny, very impulsive, and very impatient person. But he is very sorry about what happened. I still can't fathom why he would do it. I was passed out. He says he's going to talk to his therapist, he's going to go to a consent workshop, that he's always going to ask before doing things, he'll stop grabbing my ass so much (I hate having to be on guard all the time), and other things. 

He genuinely feels sorry. He knows that he did something wrong. 

Now, my feelings. I am not shocked to have ~whatever~ kind of sex this is. I like to party, but due to the two years with the boyfriend spanning my freshman year, I've never hooked up. I'm just more shocked and betrayed that it was *him* and not a random stranger. This is someone who I love, have leaned on, went on vacation with, been together for two years, etc. I just can't believe he'd do that to me. 

I don't know how I'm supposed to proceed. If I think two hard about it, I start to feel sick. He leaves to go back to school in a week, and I wish we could spend that time together without this air between us. I want to cuddle up to him and just pretend nothing happened, but that doesn't change the fact that it did. I'm not as hurt by the fact it was rape-y but more by the fact that it was my boyfriend who took advantage of me. 

(edit)He is a good person. He is actually remorseful. He says he'll do anything in order to make things right. He is an all around wonderful guy, except for this. He's like a Labrador puppy in real life. He's always been there for me. 

How can I rebuild this trust? Should I? What do I call what happened? How can we make things better? How am I supposed to have sex again when my last memory of it was this? 

tl;dr: Boyfriend of two years fucks me when I'm passed out. He feels sorry; I feel betrayed. ",TwoXChromosomes

1650354963.0,I'm really upset and exhausted with how trans women are treated.,"I feel so worthless and so inferior as a person. It sucks enough just being trans because of all the personal struggles it brings, but being constantly degraded and fetishized, treated like a joke, living with the knowledge that almost nobody will even consider actually loving me... It's just terrible. Not even to mention just being downright invalidated and literally treated as subhuman.

I've felt like I've been forced into hiding. People completely change how they perceive you once they know you're trans. And they won't unsee it. So I just do my best to pass and remain stealth. A legal name change and an F on my driver's license (and ONLY my driver's license) are the only things which are allowing me to barely live my life, but the pressure that builds is so awful.

If I'm ""lucky"" men will treat me like most women, but I don't even dare want to let it slip I'm trans to them, because it's bad enough how they treat cis women.

And I feel so othered from women. I don't need reminded I am one but there's so many things people expect me to understand or to have experienced and yet I can't relate at all and know it's because I'm trans.

So, I have been living with my best friend for the last 6 years. Although (naturally) she gets on my nerves at times, I love living with her. We have a sweet apartment that we share with our cats (she has one, I have one) and life is overall very good. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for almost six years as well. He is at the point now where he wants us to move in together. He's been very patient with me up to this point, but this is it for him. And I completely understand that. 

I am ready to move in with him. I want to. I know our relationship needs to take this next step. 

My roommate and I have discussed earlier in the year that obviously at some point I am going to move in with him. She was actually the one (I'm pretty sure it was her) who brought it up. Just as a ""oh, well I've been trying to mentally prepare myself as I figure you two will end up moving in together at some point.""  I told her she's not wrong, and that it's probably going to be sooner rather than later, but that I would still give her ample notice and whatnot. 

So, what I need help with is, how can I ""give her my notice"" in the nicest, kindest, friendliest way possible?  Like, if your best friend that you've known for 15 years was to tell you that she is no longer going to be your roommate, how would you want to be told? What scenario or setting is best? What exactly should I say? I know this isn't going to be totally out-of-the-blue for her, but it's still kind of news. 

I'm not sure why I'm so worried about this. She is a kind and rational person. And she has stated that she will likely stay in our apartment even after I move out, so I know she doesn't need to worry about finding another place to live. I just...I don't know why I'm so afraid of telling her. And I don't know how I can deliver the news in the best possible way. 

I realise that this seems like a way bigger deal in my head than to anyone reading this, but please help me.  How can I approach this topic with her in the best way? What do I say? Should I bring a bottle of her favourite wine or something when I do it? Do I try to make jokes to make it less awkward (for me)?  How would you want to be told?

Obviously if you don‚Äôt have your own finances, you can‚Äôt have separate finances.) 

My partner and I just filed for divorce and I have two observations about the process. 

First, everyone and everything you read tells you divorce is ALWAYS very expensive, and I suspect it stops people from filing when they really want to. We filed pro se for a grand total of $250. The paperwork was easy, and the clerks were available to answer questions. 

Second, the paperwork  and discussion about assets was made a lot easier because we never merged finances. We had clear paper trails of who made what as we had very few joint assets. I am paying him some ""alimony"" which we calculated out as a percentage of wages, but if we had joint finances, digging through everything would have been significantly more difficult. We would have had to hire someone. 

I think feminism conflicts with our social notion that if you ""really love someone"" you'll merge finances; I can't tell you how many women I know who merged because ""that's what you have to do"" or the marriage seems fake, or in trouble. I really think having the means for a quick and easy divorce would be more of a feminist goal but I never see it. 

Now I understand some people need to lawyer up due to their spouse being unreasonable or mean, etc, but most people I know had to get lawyers and accountants to untangle their finances to get the division of property done. They paid thousands when they probably wouldn't have had to had they kept their finances separate. Given that women usually lose money in divorces because they aren't paid as well, etc, why add pointless legal fees to that? Food for thought, women.  ",TwoXChromosomes

1361906216.0,"To those of you who didn't find the Onion's Quvenzhan√© Wallis joke racist, I think we need to talk. ","Hey Ladies,

Long time no talk.

I came upon [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1987qk/onion_joke_gone_bad_misogynistic_sure_racist_i/) thread about Quvenzhan√© Wallis on Two X today. A lot of folks apparently agree with the author's point that the Onion's joke had nothing to do with race. 

 I want to tell you, you guys are mistaken. Now, it isn't a big deal. Unless you've studied America's complicated past with gender, race and sex, you might simply be unaware of the historical context of sexualizing little black girls. This context dates back to slavery and still has lasting, real legacy today.  If you make a sexualized joke about a little little black girl, it has a different connotation because America has a particular historical context when it comes to the treatment of black girls and women. And while white women and girls have also been sexualized in hurtful ways, the two are very different, and thus, the reactions will be different. Make sense? 

If you think the fact that someone thought it was okay to publicly call a nine year old black girl a sexually charged word has nothing to do with this country's tense and very real legacy of sexualizing little black girls, I'm going to have to disagree with you. I'm going to suggest you educate yourself on our country's tense past with sexualizing black women and girls. I'm going to suggest you read Melissa Harris Perry's Sister Citizen. Or even, [this insightful blog on the Onion situation](http://www.usprisonculture.com/blog/2013/02/25/we-were-never-meant-to-survive-on-quvenzhane-wallis-intersectionality-drones/) and why it is very much about race. 

First, lets not pretend that Wallis has not been on the receiving end of several derogatory comments and jokes. So the idea that ""the whole joke is that Wallis is a sweet little girl and no one would ever use the word 'cunt' to describe her! That's the joke!"" falls short because *people have publicly been disrespectful or dismissive of her in the past.* 

The girl has gone through multiple jabs about daring to have a name that is difficult to say (never mind that somehow we all managed to pronounce names like ""schwarzenegger"" without much complaint or fanfare.) An oscar voter said ""he wasn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúvote for someone whose name I can‚Äôt pronounce.‚Äù  Seth MacFarlene made a joke about her being ""too old for George Clooney"" in a few years. Yes, the joke is technically ""on"" Clooney, but are we comfortable with a nine year old girl's being sexualized for the sake of goofing on Clooney? 

Second of all, you guys need to get that when you're a person of color, race and gender are fused. There is no separating the two--it's a package deal. It's easy for a white person to say ""this is a misogynistic joke, but has nothing to do with race."" It doesn't work that way for us. 

Lastly, and this is my most important point, **please stop telling people of color how to feel about stuff.** Like, please please please. Just stop. Sure you can have an opinion, who doesn't? But when something happens and *you* white person do not personally find it racist, why are you acting like your take of the subject is what should define it? Do you guys like it when men try to ""mansplain"" why something isn't sexist and we're all just overreacting because we're women? Of course not! So don't try to explain to me why something isn't racist. That is like [""How Not to be an Ass About Race 101.""](http://www.xojane.com/issues/how-not-to-be-a-dick-to-your-black-friend)

People found this racist. People found this upsetting. People found this offensive. 

Edit: I get that this is ""touchy."" No one is calling you a racist.  No one is ""calling you out."" Talking about race stuff is hard, but if we wanna have an inclusive, intersectional community of women, we have to be okay with talking about stuff like this.

So here's a little vent about the ""safety"" of women only spaces. I'd love to hear other's experiences and opinions as well.

TW: Sexual harassment, trauma, non-consentual photos, rape

I have never felt unsafe due to the presence of trans women, I have, however, felt unsafe in women only spaces due to the actions of AFAB women. These are my own experiences.

Locker rooms: In middle and high school, AFAB girls were the ones who took pictures of me changing and posted them to MySpace. AFAB girls were the ones who opened the back door so the boys could see me (and everyone else) in our underwear. AFAB girls were the ones who started rumors about me because of the type of underwear I wore. I felt very unsafe in those locker rooms.

Bathrooms: Ignoring the fact that men can freely waltz into a women's bathroom anytime they want anyways, bathrooms also feel unsafe for me at all times. Those same bullies from the locker rooms would take pictures over the stall doors and share them online. They stared at me through the cracks in the door until I started bringing a jacket to hold up for privacy. These were all AFAB girls.

College dorms: Ohhh boy, this was the most traumatizing. Two out of four of my roommates (AFAB women) made my bedroom unsafe for me. That's literally half of my time in college, two whole years, where I could not be safe anywhere. One had her boyfriend on Skype constantly, her camera placed so he could see the whole room and watch her, even while she slept. This also meant he watched me 24/7. I asked her to stop or turn the camera, but she refused. She also brought sorority sisters over and they LOVED to gossip about how weird and fat I was right in front of me. The other bad roommate brought a group of guys over nearly every single night. She would get drunk, pass out, and I had to listen to them rape her before they started banging on my bedroom door and try to get me to open it. ALL. NIGHT. LONG. My college dorms were not safe, and it was due to the actions of AFAB women. (Edit to clarify because I'm getting some nasty messages about victim blaming: this roommate invited the same guys over every night for two months, despite me asking her to stop. The rapes happened nearly every night as well, but she didn't consider it rape. At first I didn't blame her, but over time I considered it her fault that I went months with little sleep, too afraid to shower, eat, or use the restroom because I never knew when they would show up. She made the choice to invite them in knowing full well what they planned to do, and I begged her to stop. Repeatedly.)

I've learned that assholes will be assholes, and gender does not determine the degree of assholery. I've been traumatized by AMAB men, I've been traumatized by AFAB women, but I've never been traumatized by trans men or women. I'm so tired of hearing that my experiences aren't ""how the world really works."" TERF claims about safety don't make any sense.

Once again, this holiday season I get to relive these traumas as I explain to my mom (yet again) why her arguments about women's safety don't actually reflect reality. Oh the tears of frustration!

From the outside, hookup culture appears to empower women and give us a sense of control over our bodies. However, when you take a closer look, it's not all so perfect.
Many of my friends (and myself included) struggle to orgasm from casual sex. Many times they have sex simply because it's expected, or to brag about it to their friends. They tell themselves that they like it, but the only one enjoys the sex is the man. It sends a clear message. That men's needs are more important than women's. 

We are told that we must enjoy it, that we aren't fun if we don't. Sometimes it's so engrained in our brains that we never even stop to think ""why am I doing this"" or ""do I actually like it"". Casual ""quick"" sex is over when the man comes, regardless of how it was for the woman. No one cares and we are too scared to admit it, so it often goes unsaid. We assume it's normal or even that there must be something wrong with us to not enjoy it as much as we think we should.

Now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with having casual hookups or multiple partners, but we need to speak up about our needs. We need to prioritise OUR pleasure. Tell him that 2 seconds of rubbing your ""clit"" just wont do it. Tell him to make you come first. Stop thinking it's normal to make a stranger come and get nothing in return. 

I feel the need to say that this obviosly does not apply to all women. I'm sure that many are able to orgasm from casual sex or at least enjoy it. I'm just speaking from personal experience as well as from many stories I've heard from friends. I know I'm not alone here.",TwoXChromosomes

Then, cue the whining about today's ""namby-pamby entitled millennials who'd get offended by someone sneezing in their direction.""

You know why I think there has been such an influx of discussion about women's rights and complaints about men violating them?  It's not because we, as women, have suddenly become thin-skinned, whiny bitches.  It's because ALL WOMEN have had to put up with this bullshit for so long.  We ""just deal with it"" day in and day out, like it's the price of admission for going out into society at all.  However.  There's a movement!  Women are banding together and deciding that we've had enough of this, that we don't want to just put up with it anymore.  We're sharing our stories (and we all have SO many of them), and that looks like whining to someone who hasn't experienced life from a female point of view.

I was at the gym yesterday.   I absolutely loathe working out, but I've been trying hard to make my gym time my ""me"" time to de-stress (hot tubs, saunas, nice shower, quiet time to enjoy some entertainment while on a machine, etc).  So I was on the elliptical, watching a TV series I've been meaning to catch up on for some time.  I'm on the last machine in a row of four (the other three are empty), literally as close to the corner of the room as I can get.  Some random guy comes over.  OF COURSE he picks the machine right next to mine.  I make the mistake of glancing over, though I know I shouldn't run the risk of encouraging him in case he's one of ""those"" guys, but it's a habit.  It's just a quick ""who the hell is this getting up in my space"" glance. 

He immediately runs with it. He gives me a huge smile, and asks, ""Hi, how are you?  What's your name?""

Again, I'm in the corner of the gym on the last machine in a line of empty machines.  I'm wearing headphones, I'm watching a TV show, I'm in the middle of a workout, I'm completely minding my own business.  I give him a quick smile back to be polite, then pointedly return to watching my show.  So, OF COURSE, he spends the next five minutes on his elliptical with his whole body turned toward me, watching my phone, waiting for another opening.  I can feel my body tensing up, anxiety rising, as this guy just refuses to take the hint, until FINALLY he leaves in an angry huff.

Are you fucking serious?!  Males, is this something you have to deal with?  Because this isn't that uncommon for women.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing being friendly, or making chitchat at the gym.  However, when someone's obviously busy and wanting to be left alone, who the hell thinks that they have a RIGHT to some stranger's time?  

There's another guy at the same gym who is always at the water park when my husband and I take the boys, who just blatantly stares at me the whole time if we happen to be in the same area.  The only time he stops is when Tom notices (or I say something to him) and puts his arm around me, or shows ""ownership"" some other way.

I'm done humoring men like this because it's the ""nice thing to do.""  Half the population should NOT have to put up with harassment.  Can you imagine a man doing this kind of thing to another man?  Do any of you have any advice on how to diffuse a situation like this, or examples/stories?

Thanks for letting me vent, this has been making me angry since yesterday.

MORE EDIT:  I don't mind being hit on. I'm not overly attractive and am always wearing my wedding ring, so it doesn't happen a lot; it's a great self-confidence booster, and I usually walk away with a genuine smile.  I'm also generally an easygoing and friendly person, so I don't mind socializing either (even though I have social anxiety, it's something I've been working on for a long while).   However, there is a difference between being flirted with and having someone rudely (in my estimation) push themselves into your space and demand your attention despite every nonverbal cue in the book saying ""leave me alone please.""

This not only defeats the purpose, it puts the fully exposed women at greater risk for criminal prosecution!","So last weekend I went to a ""Free the Nipple"" rally in my city, ready to bare it all. I'm a big advocate for allowing women to go topless on beaches/parks/wherever men are permitted. A few hundred women & some men showed up; but I was a bit discouraged when the majority of the other women in attendance were shirtless, yet covering up their nips with pasties or duct tape. The whole point of the rally/movement was to discourage the current idea that men and women's nipples should be treated differently. I don't see any men wearing pasties to the beach. Our nipples aren't really free if we have to wear tape over them? 

Also, since female breast exposure is considered indecent exposure in my city, the whole idea behind the rally was strength in numbers. If we're all doing it, they can't arrest everyone. But with only a few of us doing it, it makes it easier for authorities to single us out of the crowd. Luckily nothing happened, but elsewhere in more conservative areas of the country it could.

1671998041.0,I think it's insane how white male comedians riff on white women,"To be fair, I have a lot less of a problem when a non white comedian makes a joke about white people because those kinds of jokes usually come from personal observation. Most of the jokes white male comedians make at the expense of white women just come off as riffs on stereotypes and pre-conceived biases of the situations the comedians describe.

For instance, Bill Burr recently did a joke about white women ""sitting in the same jacuzzi"" as him as a joke about how white women complain about having less rights than men. The punch line is that he assumes it's less awesome for white women than it is for him, a white man. Hurr hurr wamen could have it worse if they were a different color! Of course it's less awesome being a woman than it is a man, but Burr downplays that part because the joke is that it could be even worse if literally everything else about this made up scenario were changed to be a different made up scenario. It wasn't funny, and it didn't land because the whole joke was that his life actually was better as a man, but that he just didn't want to hear about it.

Jokes about white women can be funny if the person making the joke actually has the observational skills to understand and empathize with the different gender roles imposed on women as opposed to men. There's a lot that could be said about how white women feel that they are exceptional compared to other women, have biases based on race, etc. But I see a lot of male comedians who are white or maybe they're white and gay making jokes about how white women are entitled, aggressive or audacious. I don't understand how that joke is supposed to land when it's being presented by someone who doesn't have to deal with the kind of gender dynamics that a woman or femme presenting person does. Again, I'm not against jokes made at the expense of white women when there is a genuine social observation behind the delivery and not just leaning heavily into stereotypes.",TwoXChromosomes

You do not have the ability to psychoanalyze a person's credibility based on their body posture or tone or emotions. Everyone reacts differently to abuse. Everyone reacts differently when talking about their abuse in front of several people. There is no normal way to react. ~~Plus, years of research by Psychologists have disproven psychoanalysis is bullshit.~~


You do not have to follow your *gut* feeling and Youtube or Tiktok reactions to judge what's credible.

Darling husband just asked if he is ""annoying"" me and informed me that he feels alienated. He let me know that he's ""been down this road before"" with his last wife who stopped having sex (like, altogether) once they had children. I tried to remind him that I am actively growing his child right now, that I am nauseous all day every day, that I have cramps, that my breasts hurt every time I touch them or even walk, that I haven't had a full night's sleep all week, and that I haven't been able to take my anxiety meds because they make me 10x more sick (case in point, took one pill last night, woke up to vomit at 5am). His response? ""I'm just saying, it's been a month.""

Mind you, this MF suffers from severe depression and other issues and I am outrageously patient and supportive every damn day of HIS life. And despite all of the sickness I am feeling, I have been going to work every day (which he doesn't have to do - he works from home more days than not), I have been making the larger effort to take care of HIS children who are with us this month, I have done (as I always do) 90&#37; of the work to keep our house clean, and I've CONTINUED to be a sounding board for his frustrations, letting him vent and offering him whatever support I can even when he's a jerk about it.

BUT SORRY YOUR DICK ISN'T WET RIGHT NOW. If he thought this was the way to get me more in the mood he is SORELY mistaken. If every bit of physical pain and discomfort I am feeling just magically disappeared right now and my libido soared through the roof, I wouldn't have sex with him just for him being a selfish prick.

I'm sure I'm not the first to go through this - any advice out there on how to deal?

Edit: I really appreciate the sound advice and real talk. It's helping me a lot. And yes, I am very aware that he's really showing his true colors right now.

(This is gonna be a long post)

Anyways, this was a random thought I had while driving home. I thought, if all the men in the world somehow disappeared, we‚Äôd still be able to carry on with life, and make it safer too. If all the women in the world disappear, then humanity would cease to exist because men can‚Äôt get pregnant and the world wouldn‚Äôt be as safe. With science progressing over time, women will find a way to have children without needing men. There was this stupid quote someone once said, which was ‚Äúthings like buildings, lights, and tech were mostly made by men‚Äù and tbh, women can do those jobs too. I‚Äôve met women in engineering, law enforcement, construction, etc. A lot of women wouldn‚Äôt mind doing those jobs. 

When it comes to bars, nightclubs, etc. they need those places to be filled with women in order to make money, which is why some of those places give women free admission or drinks (although I‚Äôd be really careful about having free drinks) and if men were to have free admission, nobody would wanna go. Women are always happy being with other women, but men aren‚Äôt like that. Both men and women would rather spend time with women than men. In fact if there was a women only nightclub, women would actually prefer that over a regular one. 

Also, when it comes to dating, men are more desperate than women, now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve met some desperate women before, but I‚Äôve met waay more desperate men. Plus, a lot of women are happy being single because a majority of the time in toxic relationships, men are the problem. I‚Äôm also sure a lot of women wouldn‚Äôt mind marring another woman. 

Whenever there‚Äôs a problem, whether it‚Äôs politics, war, society, etc, it‚Äôs usually caused by men. I don‚Äôt hear many problems come from women. Im sorry to say it, but men are way more problematic than women.

I love him touching me during sexy time, but if I'm making dinner I don't want him to come up behind me and start squeezing my butt, it makes me feel like he is just thinking of the sex side of our relationship.

It got to the point I needed to do something about it, I should have just told him I didn't like it, but silly me tried to come up with a better plan and it's backfired big time. I figured he would give tired line about ""it's a compliment, but I'll try to cut back"" and it wouldn't be something he really got, just did. Instead I decided I would start touching and playing with him out of the bedroom, in the living room, kitchen etc.

Last night we were laying in bed and he mentioned how much he liked that I was being so much ""handsier"" recently and it made him feel really sexy and wanted. So now I've gone from just needing to ask him to stop, to knowing that he really won't get why, and probably having to explain that I wasn't touching him to make him feel better but actually in an attempt to do the opposite.....damn me.

What really pisses me off is the subtle sexism on other mainstream subs. *Everyone* assumes you're a guy. Even if your username is a female name like mine. And if you bother to correct them, you're downvoted and accused of attention-seeking. So the myth that all Internet users are male prevails.

1687384079.0,Tired of being a low value woman because Im smart,"Literally, I haven't met a single guy (and that IN COLLEGE) who appreciates me for my smarts - I know a lot academically (only have As) and have a lot of knowledge about quirky hobbys, like playing the guitar or writing - I do SO many different and yes, AWESOME things, like drawing and participate in competitions, volunteering, events, always go the extra mile, have a clear plan for my future, get accepted into Ivy league grad programs and... NO ONE CARES! It's ridiculous! 

When my ex and I had a break, we both went on dating apps. I know he put pictures of himself on conferences etc. on there and girls were INTRIGUED - (I know cause he dated quite a bit and we kind of became clean before finally breaking up). Meanwhile, when I put stuff on with me on conferences or dressed in a suit or doing awesome stuff, I get nearly 0 likes. I only get likes when I dress hot. Or when I'm cute but not smart or confident. And even when I think I find someone who's interested, then they just limit me.. like they're only interested in what games I play or they think I'm hot or funny or nice, but no one appreciates my success. But girls are all over my ex because of his success (and he achieved less than me lol). 

I feel like I have to pretend I'm dumbER to get a guy. I feel like guys have so many awesome girls to choose from (nearly every girl I meet has some awesome hobby) and as a girl, there's nothing out there. Like, serioysly, most guys don't have anything special to offer - like playing an instrument very well or being knowledgeable about something else or being super ambitious and smart - and if there's someone who's like this (only met like 3 or 4 guys like that in my lifetime, even in college, most of them just try to get through their degree) then they're like super arrogant (especially if hot) and don't make an effort because yes, like 10 girls are already over them. 

That's so unfair. I feel like I have so much to offer but guys only date me because they find me funny or hot or that they can do fun stuff with me. I feel so... invisible. Is it just me? Like, even on the bus - there's so many girls with like quirky stuff on their backpacks or cool tshirts and guys are just - Shorts, ugly shirt, here I am. 

Is it too much to ask for a guy who's as intelligent as me, has a minimum of 1 (1 is enough!) outside interest besides drinking beer or football and appreciates me for my intelligence and talent/ hobbies other than just 'You're hot.'... UGHHHH apparently I'll have to get a cat. 

Oh, and as I can see it coming: Everyone saying I'm arrogant or I think 'I'm so different than other girls or 'I think im cool cause I play games and have quirky hobbies', you're just dumb. It's completely fine and should be encouraged to be confident and proud of your succeess.

I know that the words that came out of my mouth could only be taken one way, so it's hard to say ""that's not what I meant"".  But it's not.  I wasn't trying to make a statement about her.... 

I was vacationing out of state, out at a bar with locals (family) and we were comparing our home states.  I feel like mine is extremely conservative, sexist, racist, you name it.  The state I was visiting didn't feel that way and my cousins were explaining how things like race are rarely an issue there.  But they also felt like my home state was pretty friendly.  When our server came to check on us they asked her if she's ever been to my home state and what she thought of it. She smiled really big and started going on about how much she loved visiting here and how friendly everyone was.  And I said ""yeah, but that doesn't really count because you're white and pretty"".  I know, I'm an asshole.  She was obviously offended and left.  I apologized profusely, multiple times.  She said she accepted my apology, but not without telling me that I knew nothing about her.  She clearly felt like I was putting her in a 2 dimensional box based solely on her appearance and subsequently dismissed her.  I didn't bother trying to explain what I meant.  Only that she was right to be offended, what I said was terrible and that I'm really sorry.  Really sorry.

And I don't know why I'm posting this... Except maybe secretly hoping that she's a redditor and maybe she'll believe that the asshole who offended her last night really didn't mean to... I don't know.

That's pretty much it, but if you care to know what I failed to convey, I'll try to explain below.  Maybe after understanding what I was trying to say, you'll still think I'm an asshole.  Maybe I am.

During Obama's first presidential campaign, you couldn't go to a local bar around here without hearing people bitch about how this country is going to shit and having a [racial slur of your choice] in the White House will only make things worse.  Kids in pick-up trucks with confederate flags literally drove around and harassed the democratic headquarters volunteers.  AAs don't usually get dirty looks at a grocery store, but they do if they're obviously in an interracial relationship.  It's common to hear teens drop the word nigger and not in a ""I'm so hip hop"" kind of way.  There's a general air of (white) racial superiority here and it's not really a secret.

And the homophobia.  Honestly, when I said ""pretty"", that was code for ""not obviously gay"".  Homosexuals and transexuals that fit a stereotypical image are not generally accepted as valued members of the community.  But I couldn't say ""and you don't *look* gay"" so somehow ""pretty"" seemed better!?!?  I would never consider ""looks gay"" and ""pretty"" to be mutually exclusive.  Pretty is not a synonym for ""straight looking"".  But I couldn't think of something appropriate to say, so I said the first word that I felt described her ""looks"".  And she is pretty, so...  Whatever. 

Yes, we have some progressive college towns.  But my state is predominantly old farming communities that value the good ol' days more than they value equality and progress.  A visitor who looks to fit the mold of what is accepted here would be met with great hospitality.  And I'm glad she enjoyed her visits here.  I just did a really shitty job of making that point and in the process treated her like her opinion was invalid because of her mugshot.  :( yuck.  I felt really sleazy. ",TwoXChromosomes

1399687942.0,My face looks manly.,"I'm mostly comfortable with my body. Enough anyway. It's pretty in it's own way, and I can recognize and appreciate that. But my face, I just don't see the good in it. I'm not a very feminine person in general, but I've been working on that and have made progress in everywhere but my face.

I'm relatively thin, but I have quite a bit of neck fat (inherited). My face just looks really flat and without any feminine shape. I have some upper lip hair and I don't wear makeup. I try my hardest to shape my eyebrows into an arch, but they just refuse to get any shape other than flat (They naturally on the thicker side, and they can be kind of messy looking, but I keep them thinner and try to tame them). My forehead isn't exactly *big*, I don't think, but it is, erm, wrinkly? My skin is also oily and shines (not sure if a result of my actual face or the lotion I use on it or something else), giving me an overall greasier look. Combined with my combination dry and greasy hair, it gives me an unkempt, messy/manly look. 

My hair is terrible and certainly adds to my face looking manlier, but that's a problem for another day.

All in all, I'm incredibly insecure about my face, but I don't really know how to fix it. I clearly can't change the shape, but I figure I can change my skin/eyebrows/etc. I use an offbrand of Vaseline's hypoallergenic lotion. I wash my face once daily--in the shower using Cerave (recommended by my dermatologist--I don't think it really helps at all, though). I've recently attempted using a different kind of lotion, but I think it was starting a breakout, so I stopped using it. I've also tried coconut oil which caused a breakout. I don't really have acne-prone skin--it's mostly zitless on it's own--but I guess my skin is just picky about products. Like I said, my eyebrows refuse to hold an arch. They also look ""piece-y"" and don't lay nice. I don't wear makeup and don't intend on it (both out of a fear of causing a breakout and because I don't think I should use makeup until after I'm ok with my appearance)--the exception being maybe mascara/eyeliner in the future. The upper lip hair is where my biggest issue is. I won't use makeup, so I can't cover it up. And I refuse to shave/wax/pluck/whatever it because I fear it growing back darker (or thicker--point is, it'll *look* darker and more noticeable as personally experienced with my stomach hair). 

Sorry for the amount of text, but I'm at the point where I just don't know what to do about it anymore. Any suggestions on ways to bring out the more feminine side of my face? I'm not necessarily interested in specific products (different things work for different people--plus, I tend to prefer using more natural products where I can), but *types* (Ex: ""lotion"", ""cleanser"", etc.) are helpful since I'm fairly inexperienced with facial/skin care. Or just something in general that I can change, I don't know.

I tried to fit in as much background here as possible, but feel free to ask more questions in the comments if I left something out!

Apologies if there's a better subreddit for this.

If you have the urge to correct someone for a statement that makes them happy or excited and isn't hurting anyone, don't. All it does is make them feel embarrassed and you sound like an asshole.

Everyone is going through a different kind of hard time. Never assume the poor are scared, the rich are happy, the married are in love, or the loners are lonely.

If Sriracha is an option -- opt for it.

Most people would rather be hurt than bored.

When people tell you you can't do something that doesn't harm yourself or others picture them saying it while buying adult diapers.

Frowning people driving past you in air conditioning should make you jog faster.

Mistakes leave scars, regrets leave wounds.

Community seasons 1-3 is the best comedy writing on network television, ever. Do yourself a favor and watch all of that.

Nice derives from Latin, it means ignorant.

People want sex, sugar, sleep and hope. 
They need encouragement.

If you're going to hit someone make sure they aren't getting back up soon.

Look up. You never look up.

Fools rush in, but at least they moved forward.

Don't trust men whose only obligations are pets that can be left alone for a weekend.

It's okay to lose friends to entropy.

You don't have to do everything you say you want to do, but you better do some of it.

I'd rather be known for admitting mistakes than avoiding them.

Cat litter: you get what you pay for.

Anyone who tells you violence and suffering should be avoided at all costs are more dangerous than most people realize.

Get hungry.

Smile at strangers.

Forgiveness is a good first choice. A right hook is a decent second, but always follow up with the first choice.

Running is bad for your joints. Diabetes is bad for your everything.

Liberals and conservatives are people that haven't realized yet that punching under water is just distraction from the sharks.

Saying you're going to stop eating meat to prevent animal suffering is like saying you're not having children to prevent child abuse.

Gay rights matter.

You do not have the right to be recreationally offended. You have the privilege, dick.

Don't be a snob about music. It's the worst.

Make the locals nervous.

Sex is not dirty, shameful, or bad -- it was made by the creator of fireflies and thunderstorms.

Bourbon is important.

Kale is important.

Put down that goddamned phone.

Guns don't kill people. Lannisters kill people.

If you think public speaking is scary you are grossly underestimating the public's apathy.

Most people who enjoy gory movies have no idea what the inside of a freshly-killed pig smells like.

You have no idea how terrified most people are.

Hug your lover from behind when they are making breakfast on the stove.

Entertainment costs money. Having fun is free.

If you can get a horse, get a horse.

Tennessee is the best state in America. Hands down.

Hats.

Money and time isn't stopping you, but that excuse is.

Food tastes better if you grow it.

Don't hang out with people who don't let dogs in their car. Christ. Just don't.

Happiness is a choice. You need to make it every single minute.

If you and your family would be dead if you were forced to stay home for 2 weeks without electricity or running water you are doing this all wrong.

Religion is not legislation. Legislation is not safety. Law and comfort don't listen, they are reactions.

Don't confuse acquisition with accomplishment.

Play more.

Sleep naked.

Leave the light on.

Visit Elkmont.

Don't prefer to be comfortable. It ruins everything.

You're not a coward if you don't jump out of a plane with your friends. You're a coward if being called a pussy is all it takes to make you.

Eat more meat -- less bread.

If you can get a dog, get a dog.

Moving to a new place isn't personal growth, but if it grants perspective it's a start.

Instagram is not required validation, for anything really.

Drink more water.

Never hold back kindness.

Expect good.

Take risks.

I don't think he approves.,"Ever since I have become pregnant (I am 20 weeks), husband and I have been arguing a lot more than usual.  Right now we are both under a lot of stress due to him leaving a high paying job he hated to one that pays half of that.  We are kind of struggling financially but we are doing our best, along with the unplanned pregnancy things have been really stressful.  

I believe our arguments stem from lack of communication.  When I ask him to do something sometimes it will come off as me having an attitude and he no longer wants any part in our discussions and will shut down.  This morning things got out of hand and things were thrown.  Not at each other...it started with me throwing a little food I was cutting, walking away, to him just going completely biserk and throwing food too.  I had never seen him that angry before.  He was yelling that he was tired of my shit.  I didn't say anything back really because I was just shocked.  We spoke again and we both agreed that we are tired of the same argument happening over and over again.  He is tired of me saying sorry and never changing my attitude so me saying sorry again doesn't do anything for him.  I looked up counselors that covered our insurance and told him about it.  He told me he thinks it is overboard, that I just need to work on thinking before I get angry at him.  I told him that that has been the solution before and it has gotten us no where and our fights have worsened.  I do not want to see it get worse from this morning.  I love this man and when we are good we are wonderful.  When we argue it is arguing for 3 minutes tops and then we go hours not speaking and I am sick of it.  I do not know what to do and I do not have ANYONE to talk to.  I already made an appointment and told him but he doesn't seem too thrilled.  I told him that I think it's good I will be able to talk to someone that will help.  He gave me no response.  Am I overreacting going to try to speak to counselor?  I literally do not know what else to do.  I have tried bettering my communication but obviously I am unable to do it on my own.

1653245128.0,Why has it become normalized to invalidate a woman‚Äôs discomfort with her male partner masturbating to porn?," As a woman, I‚Äôm tired of being told that I need to be fine with my male partner masturbating to porn. I‚Äôm tired of hearing that ‚Äúit‚Äôs normal‚Äù, that ‚Äúif he‚Äôs with you then he obviously wants you‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy would you be jealous of women he will never meet in person‚Äù. I understand that masturbation is normal - I masturbate myself. It‚Äôs the porn that bothers me and being told that I should just be ok with it. Porn, in the past twenty years, has changed drastically from nudie mags and low-budget operations. The majority of it is no longer just porn stars - anyone can make high quality porn that is readily available to the world within seconds. OnlyFans is a great example of this.

I understand that it comes down to the relationship and communication between partners about what you are comfortable with. But just because a woman prefers that her male partner not touch themselves to media of other naked women also doesn‚Äôt make her a prude. I think what many men discount is that women in today‚Äôs society (I‚Äôm from the US) are highly sexualized from an early age. It is imprinted in us through media and culture that our sexuality and sexual image is explicitly tied to our self-worth, whether we like it or not. Perhaps I‚Äôm ignorant of what the male adolescent experience is like nowadays, but growing up in the late 90‚Äôs/early 2000‚Äôs, I was practically force-fed ways to judge my own appearance in order to align better with what ‚Äúmen want‚Äù. Magazines would advertise ‚Äú10 ways to know if he likes you‚Äù, ‚Äútop tips and tricks on how to turn him on‚Äù, ect. And now, as an adult (in my late twenties), I am told to ignore that self-worth conditioning and accept that men that have needs you simply cannot always meet and you should be fine with another woman‚Äôs body fulfilling these needs? I feel that as a society, this is hypocritical and unfair. Women who are uncomfortable with their partners getting off to porn shouldn‚Äôt be immediately shut-down and have their concerns ignored (by others, not their partner).

Perhaps I am jaded and this is not the majority of women‚Äôs experiences with this topic.

1407423005.0,"Today, I walked in on my BF of two years cheating on me.","My boyfriend of two years cheated on me today.

He knew my work hours changed slightly today and I would be home thirty minutes early. He knew I told him to call me to tell me what groceries we needed. He didn't know I got out ten minutes early.

I called him as I left work and there was no answer. This isn't unusual. He leaves his phone on vibrate and usually calls me back a few minutes after I call. This time he didn't. 

I typically knock on the apartment door so he can open the door. I didn't want to be lazy so I opened it with my key. I immediately see his and a girl's shoes in the door. At first I think, 'Maybe his (male coworker) and another friend came over.' Except there is only the girl's shoes out of place. I figure out what's happening. I hear my boyfriend yelling from the bedroom that he's in the room sleeping. I walk to the door and try to barge in.

He's up against it or he locked it. But we live on the 17th floor and there's no way to get out so I step back and wait. He walks out, I see a messed up bed and a body hiding under the blankets. I walk in, he lets me walk in, and I yell something like, ""Who is it?!""

She uncovers her head and I recognize her immediately. It was his coworker that I've known for a year and a half. They always made jokes about having sex with each other but jokes are jokes. She eventually moved to a different center in a different part of town. She's married (unhappily), she was always so kind to me and my boyfriend never seemed to do anything that seemed suspicious. I call her a bitch and I call him an asshole. I start running out and they don't follow.

I get out of the building and start calling my friend. The fucked up thing is I don't live in my home country and my boyfriend and I have mutual friends. The only girl I know is one of my best Chinese friends and as soon as I tell her what happened (hysterical and crying), she sends me her address to stay with her.

Then, I remember I'm not the one who cheated right now. I turn back, run back to the apartment to catch my boyfriend. I get back on my floor with an elevator just as the second elevator closes. I hear my boyfriend, I think, so I yell his name in hopes he comes back. He doesn't. I approach the apartment and walk in and....

THE GIRL IS STANDING THERE AWKWARDLY. 

She's wearing a pretty black dress with her beautiful hair and make-up and I start getting verbally aggressive.

""Where's [my boyfriend]?""

""He went out looking for you.""

""Why are you here?!""

""He told me to stay.""

""Why? Why?! Why?! Can you even tell me why?"" I yell. ""Can you even be honest?!""

""Because I'm unhappy with my life."" She's in a loveless marriage but that isn't my fault. She CAN divorce. It's legal. She doesn't need to cheat when there's that option. They don't have children.

""I've always been sad! You took the only thing that ever made me happy! Do you realize I'm breaking up with him?!""

""I'm sorry...""

""Fuck you! How many times? Can you even tell me how many times? Can you even be honest?!""

""It was only one time.""

""You need to leave! Get out!""

I turn around and see that my boyfriend and my cats are locked up in another room. (We each have one). 

""What the fuck? The fucked up thing is you put my cats up so you can fuck my boyfriend! You need to get out!""

""I'm sorry.""

I grab her bag, force it in her hand and make her walk out the door. I close it and start getting a suitcase. We have two. One is his, the other was given to him after it was unclaimed. His is broken so it's hard to wheel. I grab the broken one and start shoving all his clothes in. I throw his phone in which he forgot. I go to grab his charger in his bedside table drawer.

Oh, look. There's a bottle of lube. Huh, we don't use lube. Condom wrapper. Yay. Not mine.

Clothes, medicine, what chargers I can find, phone and the toothbrush goes in. I hear something outside. I look out the peephole and he's sitting there, head in his hands.

I ignore him but decide I want to see how they contacted each other. I get on his phone and read his WeChat to her (only her's. I did not look for anything else).

It was a lot of ""I need you,"" and ""I'm on my way/I'm here."" I take pictures to remind myself that I can't forgive him easily. When I finish, I open the door. He sees the bag. I asked him why that girl was still here. He says because he was afraid we'd cross paths and I'd fight her (I'm not the fighting type). I ask him how many times.

Twice. Today (Thursday.) Last Thursday. 

I ask him how long he'd been thinking about making their joking sexual tension serious. About three weeks. Why? ""I don't know. I seriously don't know."" This is the same answer after I ask multiple times.

Did anyone else know? No.

I tell him it's fucked up the cats were put away while she was allowed to have sex with him. I tell him the lube is fucked up (because I had to find it).

He's sobbing the whole time and I come to remember something that happened a year and a half ago. I got drunk and cheated on him with my roommate. We were long distance at the time. I was very unhappy. I kept trying to end the relationship but he would beg me to stay and I would. I knew it was wrong and it didn't happen again. I cut off all contact from the guy. I moved across the world to be with him. I took a job so I could stay. I hated myself for cheating. Every day. I learned that some cheaters don't cheat again. I'm mentally incapable of cheating and hating myself even more.

I remember thinking I would tell him if he cheated (not that I planned on it) and I would forgive him. I didn't expect my reaction when it actually happened. I told him we seriously needed to talk. In the door way, I told him the same as I wrote. 

I don't believe our cheating was the same. Was it wrong? Yes. However, my boyfriend cheated for some fucked up reason I can't understand.

I've been here all along, almost always prepared to have sex. We planned on having sex after I got off work. He knew I had some troubles with our relationship (I wanted to do more than watching TV) and depression. I thought he understood.

But he didn't say anything. He didn't suggest he was unhappy. He didn't do anything suspicious sounding. He doesn't even know why he cheated. (Though, the girl is very dirty and likes more kinkiness than me). If he wanted me to be different in bed, he could have asked. We have that relationship.

No, I don't think our cheating was the same. Who knows how long it would have gone on before I caught them? Every Thursday? (At some point, I tell him I took pictures of the messages and it makes me sick while I type this). We were living together. We discussed being together for our lives (something we hadn't while I cheated). I now live across the world just so our relationship would be better. He cheated in our apartment together when we were going to have sex today anyway. He can't even cut contact with her because they work for the same company! How do I know he won't do it again?

""Do...d-did you even love me?""

""Of course I do! I love you so much!""

At first I tell him we're over but I hate to see him leave for the elevator. I allow him to grab his cellphone charger and he asked for his phone. I know I've thrown it in his bag but first, I want the key to the apartment (at some point, I explain I'll refund his money that he paid for the apartment IF he gives me MY bit of money in his bank account.) 

He gives it to me and I tell him his phone is in his bag. He's in a daze and I let him in the apartment to grab his cellphone charger. He starts taking the sheets of the bed. I rip them all off, saying I don't want them. I ask him what he's doing and he says he's looking for his phone. I snap, reminding him it's in his bag. He grabs a couple more things, stands forlornly in the doorway.

We talk for a few minutes. I haven't broken up with him. I ask him to wait having sex with anyone before we decide what to do. He cries the whole time. I touch him because I'm so in love with him. I hate seeing him in pain. He recoils and cries harder, saying he doesn't deserve it. I pull back with little problem. I tell him he can say goodbye to his cat until we figure out the apartment (his cat will go with him). I don't think he wants to. I think he wants the pain. He keeps saying he loves me.

My Chinese friend called me and I cried more. I saw my mom on Skype but she's not at home (computer on). Some of our mutual friends have tried asking me. I talked to one of our chatty friends because his fiance cheated on him. I thought he might have advice but really, our friends are more his friends so I don't know if I can go to them. Though, they probably know now.

A lot of our friends are or will be surprised. My Chinese friend thought we were perfect (something I denied). We were always so close; kissing, hugging and holding hands. One guy joked I was his wife. I had no realization this was coming. (Hah. Cumming) I thought I could tell him our troubles but he didn't return the sentiment.

So, I'm on Reddit. Really lost and confused, hurt and angry. I keep thinking, 'Oh, god. He actually cheated on me. How did this happen?'

Edit: I should clarify.

Me telling him I cheated was NOT to get even. I left some of the speech out but I thought it would go more like, ""It's okay. I cheated too. It happens. We'll get over it."" When I found out it happened more than once and he had no intent of stopping, I was shocked. I was very hurt when I realized the woman who cheated on him with was my friend. I left that out. We weren't good friends but whenever I saw her, we always talked. She seemed happy to see me. It hurt and I'm still shocked.

Right now, I won't bail. I know what I did was wrong. However, there IS a different in this cheating. I changed after I realized it was wrong. He knew it was wrong, he said he felt bad about continuing but kept up with it. We're both in the wrong. 

I'm weak but I like the truth. I was wrong, I deserved it. I'm shocked that I didn't forgive him. I know I probably will. Thank you to all of you responding, even the negative ones.

Edit 2: This is probably going to be buried soon. Thank you to the ones who provided actual insight, whether it was good or bad about myself. To those who just slammed me, shrug. Honestly, my boyfriend and I probably both deserve the bad comments. Yet, we're good people too. In the end, I'll deal with my life in the way I can try to be the most productive. 

I've never lived in a black and white world, like some people are saying. My life has always been a mix of grey. I realized young that good people do bad things and bad people do good things. I like my grey world, even if it's confusing. 

Thank you but soon, this post won't be seen anymore. Too many downvotes and that's okay. I needed to hear what I needed. I'll talk with my boyfriend and go where we both best are needed to go. Thanks for your help. I'm gonna figure out what to do with my life from here on out.",TwoXChromosomes
1690535326.0,He didnt want to go down on me?,"So had a hookup with a nice guy (m30). We were making out for a hot minute and he then actually was fingering me instead of going straight into stickin his dick in. Which was a nice change. Then I initiated giving him a blowjob. Later when I asked him if he could go down on me, he said he doesnt feel comfortable going down on a women until hes been on a few dates which he didnt go further into.

Im trying to keep an open mind here, but I genuinly dont know what is behind that thought process.

EDIT: sorry wasnt clear! But my main issue was not specifically him not going down on me but not caring about me not feeling good. As he could have spoken to me more about it and suggested something else. Rather than leaving it. If Im to continue this, then its worth communicating that openly with him as his response would dictate his character better. However I do understand the perspective that feeling like a man must eat your pussy is the same as a man feeling like he must be given a bj. But penetration alone isnt going to turn a woman on or make her orgasm. Its not about feeling entitled to recieving head but actually feeling some pleasure which can be harder from the womans side of sex.",TwoXChromosomes
1633633980.0,TIL that gender affirming facial hair removal is not covered by insurance for transgender women and I want to do something about it,"I would like to start a letter writing campaign to help get facial hair removal covered by Medicaid and insurance companies in the US. Is anyone else willing to join me?   


If so, I have included a template letter you can use. 

&#x200B;

Dear Representative \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

The CDC estimates that 2% of US high school seniors are transgender. Their lifetime risk of depression is 50% and one in three will attempt suicide.  

Research has shown that gender affirming procedures decrease both mental distress and suicidal ideation in transgender people. In 2015, Connecticut made a big leap forward by making gender affirming surgeries covered by Medicaid. 

However, I am disheartened to learn that electrolysis and laser hair removal for transgender women is NOT covered by insurance and considered cosmetic.  

Hair is an important organ that signals our gender to those around us. For transgender women, it can be horrifying to live fear of someone seeing their five o-clock shadow and feeling they need to shave twice a day and wear copious makeup in order to appear feminine. This distress impacts every aspect of their daily lives. When you look at a person, the first thing they see is their face. Unfortunately, electrolysis and laser hair removal procedures are often very expensive putting lower income transgender women at greater risk of mental illness because they cannot afford to access it.  

There is no reason why insurance companies shouldn‚Äôt pay for this, including Medicaid. It is an integral part of the transitioning process and impacts every aspect of a transgender woman‚Äôs daily life. I ask that Medicaid cover hair removal from the face because this is an integral part of feeling and appearing feminine for these women. It is not cosmetic, it is a medical necessity for them to feel whole and appear feminine.  

I am writing to you on behalf of the transgender women in our community. Please expand Medicaid coverage to cover electrolysis and laser hair removal from the face.  

&#x200B;

Warmest Regards,

1588972858.0,I‚Äôm so sick of men making it about them when it‚Äôs not about them,"There was a post on January Jones insta today talking about the domestic violence that WOMEN and GIRLS face, because it exists at a much higher, systemic, more traumatic rate than it does for anyone else, the world over for the past 10k years.

I shouldn‚Äôt have read the comments but all over the comments men were like ‚Äúmen can be victims of domestic violence too‚Äù and anyone who pointed out that we‚Äôre talking specifically about women rn sweetie was called a ‚Äúman hater‚Äù and again I know these are Internet comments but for some reason it just got my blood boiling today, because the comments from men saying ‚Äúcall it GENDER equality‚Äù who obviously just wanted to erase women‚Äôs voices seemed to be getting way more likes than anyone else.

When we talk about rape and violence against women we are talking about the SYSTEMIC abuse that WOMEN face at a *higher rate* because it is rooted in SEXISM AND MISOGYNY. We are talking about the extensive physical damage that is done to women by the sheer fact that their male partners are usually much, much stronger than them and can inflict more damage than a woman usually could to a man. You cannot compare a woman hitting their male partner to a male hitting their woman partner. It is not the same thing, and it does not happen as often or even remotely in the same context.

You cannot compare the way women walk around the world in fear of rape to anything else. Men do not get pulled into back alleys and gang raped by women. Men can overpower their female partners and do not get raped within the same kind of power dynamic that causes women to suffer in rape culture, and that is a *privilege*. If I‚Äôd had the strength to physically overpower my rapist, he would not have raped me. When he hit me it caused me to temporarily go blind and he was ‚Äújust playing.‚Äù The social trauma women carry from the global experience of violence and rape since the beginning of time is nothing like the trauma some men might carry from an experience of rape or abuse. It is not the same and it should not be controversial to say so.

I‚Äôm so sick of men, and having to make space for them in FEMINIST discourse. Can you imagine if any other privileged group got away with strong-arming themselves into the discourse of an oppressed group? Can you imagine if gay people at an LGBT rights forum said, ‚Äúnow let‚Äôs not forget straight people have problems too.‚Äù The problem would be glaringly obvious and people would literally laugh. Men don‚Äôt have male-specific problems in a patriarchy. Straight people do not have straight-specific problems in a heteronormative society. White people do not have white-specific problems in a white supremacy. And yet stating one of these obvious truths gets ridiculous backlash. I‚Äôm tired of it. Men are the only ones whose ‚Äúproblems‚Äù double as privileges and the only one they seem to be able to assert is ‚Äúmen can‚Äôt express emotions.‚Äù 1. That directly relates to men being granted leadership roles and 2. WOMEN CAN‚ÄôT EXPRESS EMOTIONS EITHER. Are you kidding me? Ronald Regan pulled off his fucking shoe and slammed it against a podium and was considered a ‚Äústrong leader‚Äù for it meanwhile a woman expresses an emotion in any context and her reputation sinks and sinks, she can‚Äôt be angry anywhere, she can‚Äôt cry at work, she can‚Äôt get visibly angry about female issues even when she‚Äôs running for President in a patriarchy where half the population is women.

I‚Äôm so sick of it. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of it. We have to change this. We have to take back feminist discourse from men who only seem to care about ‚Äúmen‚Äôs issues‚Äù when it erases the voices of women, makes them sit down&shut up about their oppression because it makes them uncomfortable. Men, be QUIET WHEN WOMEN ARE TALKING.",TwoXChromosomes
1510770785.0,"I didn't say ""Stop."" He is my husband.","I awoke this morning with the cough and congestion I had gone to bed with. My voice is hoarse and I have no energy. To try to chase me out of bed, my husband began caressing and fondling me. I'm still half asleep and don't really have the energy to care about his attention. He takes this as permission to continue, sliding his hand down my pants and between my legs. I still don't react, negatively or otherwise, so he pulls my pants down, spreads my legs apart and enters me. 

I say, ""You're taking advantage of me in my weakened state.""

""I'm amazed you're letting me.""

I don't move. I don't say anything. I just wait for him to be done. After 6 or 7 minutes, he is. He gets off me, and I cover myself with the blankets, wanting to go back to sleep, and I notice I have tears in my eyes. He leaves to use the bathroom, comes back after a few minutes, turns the ceiling light on and tells me to get out of bed because he needs help getting the kids around, specifically, my 5 year old daughter. It's already after 7:00 by the time I pull myself out of bed, fighting back waves of hacking coughs. I put on my bathrobe, leaving my glasses on my bedside table, use the toilet, and help my daughter get dressed. I follow her downstairs to manage breakfast. I ask him if he would like me to make him coffee. He says yes, there will probably be time for it to brew while he packs up the car. I fill the kettle, set it on the burner, and wash out the french press from yesterday's grounds. When I open the freezer door to get out the coffee beans, a small glass jar falls towards my face. I catch it in my left hand, and am confused when broken glass shatters on the floor at my bare feet. Without my glasses, I see blurry glints of light glittering on the wood of the kitchen floor. 

My wrist is bleeding slightly and my husband is shouting at me. ""I don't have time for this!"" 

I ask, ""Why would you put that up there?!"" 

He hands me a pair of my shoes, and I try to corral the cats and dog away from the broken shards of test tubes which had been turned into seed storage for some insane reason. He answers my question with a complaint: ""Half the stuff up there doesn't need to be there!""

""I don't want half the stuff up there,"" I respond, looking at the disposable plates, cups, and bowls he has designated be stored on top of the refrigerator.

""There's no other place to put them!,"" he shouts, ignoring the space in the pantry, the shelves in the basement, or the empty cupboard space of the kitchen. 

Tears are welling in my eyes, and I hoarsely choke out, ""Why are you yelling at me? I haven't done anything wrong."" My eyes fall to my wrist and see blood beginning to clot on the small scratch the shattered glass gave me. ""I got cut, and you haven't even apologized.""

""I'm sorry that the glass shattered and you got hurt,"" he replies, managing to phrase it in a way that avoids taking responsibility for the accident. He sweeps majority of the broken glass and assorted floor litter into a pile in the center of the kitchen, as I reassure the kids that I am okay. I try to usher them out the door, but they insist on giving me another hug and kiss, being very uneasy about seeing their mom in tears. I go upstairs, intent on going back to sleep and trying to forget that this morning happened. 

I hear my husband come back in, and shout up the stairs, ""I'm sorry about the mess. You might want to clean it up before your cat bats glass all over the house."" I hear the back door slam shut and, after a few moments, the car leaving the driveway.

I find my glasses and go back downstairs, finding the pile of broken rubbish still in the center of the kitchen, with small shards scattered here and there. I sweep up the pile and the stray shards, discover I have to insert a trash bag into the bin, because God forbid that happens when the trash is taken out. I make another carafe of coffee, take my medication, and start my workday. I'm coughing, weak, tired, and wrung out like an old sock. I cancel my supervisor's meeting for today, and try to get some computer work done, if I can just concentrate. I can't. This can't be normal, right?  The avoiding blame and criticism is nothing new, but the sex overpowering was. It wasn't rape, I know that if I had said no, he would have stopped. But I didn't say yes. He never asked if it was what I wanted. He took. Without asking. And I feel violated. I feel ashamed that for whatever reason, I didn't say ""Stop."" He is my husband. 

I am sick with a cough and a cold, and want to be nurtured and pampered and taken care of. He used me, was unable to manage getting the kids ready without demanding my help, then berated me for making a mess that he didn't have time to clean up, never checked that I was okay, and left the mess for me to deal with anyway.",TwoXChromosomes

1403706887.0,My abortion,"Hey everyone, first time post.  After reading a number of women's abortion stories here I feel obliged to share mine.  

10 years ago today I had my abortion.  At the time I was 21, had just finished college and about to start my dream job as assistant manager of a medium-size business in my hometown that I had interned at for several months.  

My boyfriend of 3 years and I had always been careful to use protection but one graduation party got the best of us.  I think half of my morning sickness was the baby and the other was the sickening question of ""What do I do NOW?""  To have the baby would mean taking several steps back on my career and I just wasn't ready to be taking care of a baby.  

The only person I spoke to about this was my mother.  She has always been a bit liberal but I didn't expect her to be so quick to suggest an abortion.  Yet after speaking to her it seemed so clearly the right thing to do.  She helped drive me to PP where the staff was friendly and welcoming and the procedure went as well as could.  All except for an immediate sense of loss afterwards.  

A few days later my boyfriend, who had moved with me, sensed something was wrong and asked where I had been.  My excuses of hanging out with my mom weren't well designed and it eventually came out that I had gotten pregnant and had the abortion.  He was outraged.  We had spoken about getting married and having kids before, but I never knew how much that had meant to him.  I spent alot of time crying because at this point the reality of what had occurred sank in.  I had chosen to take my baby's life rather than be willing to slow my career.  Life less important than work?  What was I thinking?  After 10 years down this path I can tell you, work is not worth it.  

My boyfriend and I broke up.  We tried keeping it together for many months, but he couldn't get past how I could make the decision to abort his baby without evening talking to him.  And that is my biggest regret by far.  

I have since married another wonderful guy and we have two children.  They are the love of my life and I cannot imagine a world without them.  Ironically that dream job went bankrupt so I now work less hours with a smaller business, but that's fine with me so I can be home more often.

A few final thoughts: Women, if you are thinking about an abortion, please talk to the father.  You have a moral obligation since it is as much his child as yours.  And don't expect any true counseling at PP. In hindsight, despite several conversations with the PP staff, not one seriously suggested any other choice but an abortion. Its a business like any other and their only intent is to usher you to the procedure table and wave goodbye.

Thank you for reading my story.  I don't judge anyone who makes the choose for abortion and hope my experience helps you with your decision.",TwoXChromosomes
1399422907.0,My mom's in an abusive relationship. I'm on the other side of the country.,"(Throwaway because people IRL know my Reddit name)

I went back home for the weekend and talked with my dad for a bit. He mentioned that things with my mom and my stepdad are not going well. At all. A few weeks ago she came by to pick up my sister, and she had a black eye. Last week, Mom and Stepdad got in a fight, and he kicked her out of the car in the middle of an unfamiliar part of town; she had to walk around and find a church, no phone, no purse, nothing.

Both my mom and my stepdad have serious alcohol problems, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're both a danger to each other. But simply due to the size difference, I think my stepdad could pose a serious physical threat to my mom. He's also a hunter, so he has guns.

I'm really worried, I don't know what to do. I'd try to set her up with some info but I know he goes through her phone. I don't know if I can call her and not have him overhear. I'm worried that if I try to help her, I'm going to get her in even more trouble. My dad has encouraged her to get a divorce but she doesn't really listen to him.

","I've seen a ridiculous amount of cutting others down, slamming others for petty things like grammar errors, spelling mistakes, and other such nonsense in replies to facebook posts that are blatantly sexist. I've said it before, and I'm here to say it to every last one of you. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Before you get all taken aback and think I'm simply chastising you like children, think. Do you remember the article Ashley Judd wrote in response to people commenting on how she ""must have"" had work done when she had a puffy face and how most of them were women? Or how about the video that's been on youtube where a woman walks around with a gentleman getting other women to sign a petition to end women's suffrage (in which they blatantly lie and say suffrage is women suffering. If you're going to pull a prank like that, don't be stupid and lie about it. enough about that though.) But when someone comments on sexist things being posted on facebook, or girls supporting the war on women and posting about it and showing their replies and we rip them apart for their *grammar*. REALLY?! *really?* Do I need to go all Amy Poehler here? Let me point something out, I've had guy friends who respect me and who I respect say ""when I see girls tear each other down for expressing opinions that support women based on something that might simply be something they grew up writing, I'm honestly not surprised the Religious Right are finding it so easy."" When we tear each other down and get catty and bitchy over stupid things like chat speak on facebook (come on, my aunt uses chat speak on facebook. I don't, I hate it, but some people talk that way. *get over it.*) it's almost like the demons of patriarchy have won. ""Oh look, the hormones and emotions are taking over the stereotypical women, we have defeated them in what they thought was their own battle by forcing them to succumb to the stereotype they claim to not be."" So think before you simply rip someone apart. 

We fight over whether the pretty girls have a right to be pissed off, or the skinny girls, or the ugly girls, or the fat girls, or the blond girls, brunette, green, purple, polkadotted. **WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?!** It's what the people who are trying to move us back to pre-sexual liberation era want us to do, because it keeps us distracted from the fact that the Lily Ledbetter act is under fire, as is birth control, abortion, planned parenthood, and I'm sure more rights that we don't pay attention to because we're bitching at each other about shit that doesn't matter. So put on your big girl panties and deal with it. So what if someone makes a typo, writes ppl instead of people, uses then instead of than and their sentiments are expressed. So listen up, stop tearing each other down. I'm sure I'll get some hate for this, and great, bring it on, I *do not care*. All I care about is that if someone sees this and says ""alright girl, hell yes, let's get back on the focus, which is women should be for women and their rights, and not tearing each other down."" then I know I've got at least one person that's pickin' up what I'm layin' down.

I'm afraid of saying something that might offend someone, or coming across as misogynistic by not using sensitive/appropriate language.

Yesterday I was cleaning and, as usual, he was playing a video game. He works from home right now because his company lets him do telework, and to be honest I don't even know why they think he's a necessary employee. A few days ago he was drinking a beer at his desk while going over an Excel spreadsheet. In the evening I asked him to do SOME housework... ANY housework, and so he starts cleaning the coffee maker.

Hello???? The coffee maker???? The house is a complete mess and you choose the freaking COFFEE MAKER?

So I thought next time I'd be specific. This morning I woke up and started telling him everything he had to do today. He immediately put in a pair of earplugs that he bought off of Amazon and told me that when I get ""annoying,"" he'll just put them in until I tire myself out. I immediately told him to apologize, and he shrugged and pointed at his ears with the ""sorry, can't hear you"" look. 

Later on I told him that the floor of the bathroom was dirty because SOMEONE splashed water on it while peeing, and he immediately put his earplugs back in and went back to work. When I kept talking he just gave me an exaggerated ""Shhhhhhhhhhhhh!"" and turned back to his computer.

I'm so fed up with his emotional abuse. I told him that it was a form of domestic violence, so what did he do? Yeah you guessed it. Earplugs in. Fuck my life and fuck this quarantine.",TwoXChromosomes
1402939114.0,There is hope! TwoXChromosomes going to default may not be so bad after all.,"So I know a lot of us have noticed weird downvote patterns since the sub went to default.  There have also been plenty of posts meant to troll or derail conversations about things like misogyny and rape culture (or deny their existence).  Personally, I believe this has to do with an influx of MRA (and related offshoots) whose modus operandi lately is to flood areas of the internet with hateful messages of misogyny.  In fact, I predict a flood of downvotes and more from this thread.  

BUT, I actually think exposing more people to TwoXChromosomes will be a great thing in the end by making some men (and women possibly) more aware of women's issues.  It may make more people self-aware of how their subconscious is shaped by the patriarchy and how women are viewed and treated in the culture at large.  I was on the television subreddit, and read this quote by a fellow which made me realize this (and made me smile).  With his permission, here is what he wrote:

>I know that being hyper pointed in comments and stereotypes in media helps people identify quickly with what that character is about but perhaps this is a bad thing. I think that we should look towards either A) Educating people in such a manner that they don't need such obvious and damaging hints or B) step away from such crass humour.

>I get it. We all laugh at the occasional dick joke, or something inane, but sometimes we need to step past that.

>**TwoX becoming a default made me realise how much of a dick I can be on a day to day basis to women without realising it. I'm pretty much a walking caricature of a man at times. Typical ""Laddish"" behaviour and all that.**

>But I am just regurgitating references and behaviour I've seen in TV and through other people when growing up. Sometimes I don't even realise that I'm spewing up these rehashed jokes I'm not even sure if it's original or something I've heard before. 

>It's pretty sad in that respect. Tragic even.

>But anyway enough about my issues. 

>I feel that modern media, TV & film, has really stepped up and is now available to a much wider audience. So as such sure it has a responsibility to be...well, a bit more responsible?

Your first reaction is to get defensive because you feel accused.

We already know it's not all men. Because other men do terrible things doesn't make you guilty. But please be aware of our struggles, we're not making this shit up. And instead of getting defensive, just accept that even though you are not one of them, there are a lot of shitty sexist abusive men out there. Some of them are even your close friends, your family.

If you believe that women are human beings, worthy of respect and equal rights, then be an ally, not a denier. We need your help to call them out when you see or hear them degrading women...because as women know well, misogynists will NOT listen to women, they only hear when other men put them in check. When we do it, it's a joke, and another reason to hate us even more.

1405266635.0,I can put together Ikea furniture - but don't tell the men that.,"This is going to be a bit of a rant because I'm about to lose my fucking shit on these people.


Let me start with the fact that my SO is amazing and wonderful and I love him to bits. His family, on the other hand, I want absolutely nothing to do with.

They chastise me for coming from a different world. A world where a house that isn't the equivalent of a hospital is okay, a world where it's a known fact that if we know you, take what you need from our cabinets or pantry. It's okay. You're an adult and you can serve yourself. I (not my SO, mind you, because he's a boy and shouldn't have to be a perfect little princess host) shouldn't *have* to offer you a glass of water you probably don't even want after telling you this very simple fact of my life, albeit in much kinder words. I shouldn't have to worry about whether or not I've done well enough, whether it's clean enough, whether I'm pretty enough, whether I've done a good enough job with something stereotypically considered feminine.

And I shouldn't have to worry about being told I'm a horrible host for refusing help with a dresser from Ikea that I was putting together **just fine on my own**. I had all the drawers done. I was about to put the shell together and they (SO's uncle and step-dad) barged in and told me they would ""help me finish it,"" which translates into ""we don't actually trust you to do this right or without calling on us every five seconds, please leave."" If I hadn't let them do this, if I had insisted on finishing it myself, my SO would be hearing from his mother about what a horrible person I supposedly am.

All of the criticism I've faced with this move, with the furniture, with the cleaning, with my ability to be a ""gracious host,"" for being someone who comes from a very different world, has sent me back into a depression I'd hoped I would escape.

I've spent days just wanting to cry and give up because it doesn't matter what I do. I can't do anything right. Nothing I do is good enough for these people. Not even my perfectly clean filtered water is good enough (they brought a case of bottles of water to put in *my* fridge in hopes that I would offer them that, which backfired because I didn't even know that they were in there so they got glasses instead).

I'm not wanted here. I'm not welcome. I'm tainted, an outsider, I'm dirty and filthy and gross and never good enough.

I can put together Ikea furniture better than they can, but it won't be good enough because I, a girl, put it together. I'm supposed to be pretty and prim and waiting on them hand and foot. My opinions don't matter, my words aren't worth hearing. I can't fix things I actually can, in fact, fix because I'm a girl.

I just want these people to go away. I don't want to see them ever again. I can't handle them. But I'm stuck with them.   ",TwoXChromosomes

Sooner or later, they all disappoint or devastate me. 

All the while they get their needs met, do what they want and seem to really believe they are good people. Again and again I was optimistic to find men in the world that are not out for favors, sexual or otherwise. And to date, I've never found one that isn't so self-absorbed that they can see me for who I am and what I need and actually care enough to put their own shit aside for 1 second. 

I have had multiple mental breakdowns as a result of the way I've been treated and talked to by men. I went to visit family last week to get away from the stress. And lo and behold, my aunt's husband was acting strange. He left the house for 3 hours the first day I was there- conveniently it was over lunchtime. The second day, he did the same. His excuse is he goes to the park to walk/exercise. He has lost weight during the pandemic, so it would seem that that is a good reason. BUT on both days, he was supposed to go grab this special onion my aunt wanted, and on both days he came back empty-handed, saying the store didn't have it. Then later that night, he insisted on going to the backyard to check the (humane) trap for animals. I was waiting on him to start a movie and he was taking forever, so I looked out the window, and he was just standing there and appeared to be on the phone. He saw me in the window and turned on the flashlight and walked away. 

....So now I think he is cheating on my aunt. They have been together for decades and he is in his 70s. 

So my getaway to the one place I thought I would be safe from thinking about all the ways I have been emotionally abused by men....ends with me now trying to figure out what to do about this man. Do I try to find out what is going on by tracking him? Do I devastate my aunt?

1568315240.0,"The mocking/shaming of ""I'm not like other girls"" mentality some teenage girls go through is a way of policing female identity","I think when a girl grows up in a culture that restricts female identity, that clearly sends the messages that girls should care more about femininity, makeup, clothing, than career, games, other traditionally masculine concerns, of course they'd strike out and try to differentiate themselves in a bid to be authentic. To say that teenage girls have no reason to not want to be like the stereotypical teenage girl is gaslighting imo. It denies the reality that the image of a stereotypical teenage girl is deeply sexist, meant to indoctrinate teen girls and keep them from growing into an authentic version of themselves.

In fact, a woman's maturity is still defined by how well she conforms to gender stereotype. I'm in my mid twenty, and people absolutely do think of me as immature for using a backpack instead of a woman's bag. They seem to not understand that I will never grow out of this phase.

I've been looking at all the hate Billie Eilish gets for dressing in a gender nonconforming way, for instance. A lot of people mock her for being ""edgy"". I'm just grateful that she has been brave and stayed true to herself. We can never know how many women grow up stifling major parts of themselves in order to avoid mocking/policing. I've read quite a few stories on female celebrities who IRL are quite smart and nerdy but chose an over-sexualized image for themselves instead.

1463069418.0,Called out an old pervert for taking pictures of girls at the beach yesterday and still fuming,"Hey /r/twoxchoromosomes

So about me, I'm really not a confrontational type of person. I'm the type who has been taken advantage of for how ""beta"" I can be or just for being a doormat sometimes. Sometimes my friends say I'm too nice. But I'm also the type that, whenever I do confront someone, my emotions have to kept in check because I get fired up. 

Anyway, yesterday, my close friend and I wanted to have a good beach day. Once we settle down and are laying out we notice these 3 older men (stereotypical, wrinkly douches that never really grew up or learned to respect women) sitting around some tens of yards away and one of them is ogling every girl that walks by. He is even taking pictures of them and whistling and when they catch on he immediately acts like he's not guilty, just looking at his phone. The other two old guys aren't doing anything, pretty much enabling him. A lot of these girls are quite young (recognized most of them from my high school, we're a small-ish town). Of course I wanted to call him out (which I do, later) but all the parts of me that were brought up to ""just ignore it"" and ""that's how men are"" are telling me not to. 

So as if this isn't enough, the old pervert gets up and goes to the shoreline and takes a piss, basically exposing himself. It was very blatant and while the beach wasn't as crowded, how others didn't notice or didn't say anything to him is beyond me. As this is happening my friend and I are getting worked up, and his friends are just laughing at him. By this time, it's clear to them that we're aware of everything and I guess it's just funny to them.

Finally, they get up to leave. They're gathering their things and the old pervert is the first to head back. He's about to pass us and he's getting closer and closer, staring us down. My adrenaline is rushing, I'm getting very nervous AND angry, and my friend (who is more outspoken than me) says ""Don't stare at me, keep walking."" The old man is a bit taken aback and says ""I was just waiting for my men"". Finally, I explode. ""No, no wants you here. We saw you take pictures of those girls. Now you better go back and delete all of them. It's wrong. We saw you do that a lot."" The old guy is dumbfounded and seems a little flustered and says ""Uh, I'll delete them when I go back to my car,"" and I just spit out ""Yeah, you do that"", and that was it. 

After all of this happened, I had to take a breather. Tears were rolling down so I put on my sunglasses. I called my mom and told her what happened. I just have never done this before. But as my emotions were leveling out, I knew that my reactions and words were justified. Men like this deserve to be exposed, embarrassed, publicly humiliated. Because it's sad and true, no one else would have said squat to him. And I think he knew it. His friends knew it. But, I'm tired of sitting back and watching.

Help?","Hi, I posted on /r/TwoXChromosomes two times last week about a really sensitive situation with my boyfriend and his past. I've been getting notifications and messages from people from my previous threads and I just wanted to provide a final update to the situation. 

Thank you to everyone who posted in both threads. I think the comments in the last thread were somewhat mean, and it really, really hurt my feelings so I just will update this thread (for anyone that may be interested) and explain my thought process and let it be. 

This is the link to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3azfd7/my_boyfriend_told_me_his_deep_dark_secret_and_im/) and [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3b3nen/update_my_boyfriend_told_me_his_deep_dark_secret/) for context. 

______________________

I'll say this at the beginning to just not waste anyones time. **I decided to stay with Michael.**

What he did is indefensible. There is no dancing around that... it was disgusting, inhumane, and wrong. I don't think it defines him and I think he has changed fundamentally from that night years ago. 1 mistake in isolation cannot define a person, and it happened before we even met. 

The man I fell in love with is an entirely different human being. We have a life together and a future and he is my partner. I think I talked about some of our disagreements a bit too much in the original post. Any relationship has those small things. I don't love sometimes when he is decisive and demanding... but I also love that he is confident and ambitious and in-control. That is a minor thing and looking at something like that under a microscope isn't fair. 

There is so much more to our relationship. He is smart... he understands me, he challenges me, and he is mysterious in the best ways. I never know exactly what he is thinking and that is fun. I love that about him. I love that we are always learning more about one another. 

What it comes down to is... we have this relationship that we've worked at for 2+ years now. It works for us and it fits us perfectly. I don't want to throw that away over a mistake Michael made as almost a child. He knows it was wrong, and he saved himself. That isn't honorable... but if it was my son, and it was truly a one x mistake that was out of character, I'd want him to do the same. 
___________________________________

The realization for me was when I was responding to my update thread and I'd get the new notification and some of the messages were like, Your boyfriend is a fucking loser. He is trash. And I was offended and upset and felt defensive. I wanted to scream, ""THERE IS MORE TO THE STORY"". ""YOU DON'T KNOW HIM"". 

And I imagined how he would feel if I left him. He trusts me. He told me his darkest secret in the world because *I asked him to*. He didn't hold back the truth when he easily could have and it could have made him look better. My boyfriend, who never breaks character, was in tears. 

That situation with him is just complicated. From the outside looking in, it looks fucked up. But there are two sides, and I'm at ease with my decision. When I came home from my weekend trip, he had written me a handwritten ten page letter telling me he would understand if I left him, and he wouldn't blame me, and he went into his feelings of shame, guilt after the incident, and then asked me to just think it over and if I want to end things he'd understand, and there would never be any hard feelings. He talked about why he loved me, what he wanted us to do in the future, how he wanted me to be the Hillary to his Bill, and was just so heartfelt and genuine and I knew after reading it that I couldn't leave. 

I think with just the shocking confession, it made me question if I love him. And what I realized is I absolutely, completely do. It may not make sense to everyone, but no one else knows our history. I spent this entire past weekend considering if I should end our relationship, and my heart says no and my mind says no. 

Anyways, so there is that update. I was unsure whether to post this, because I really think people won't understand the decision and may hate me. I ended up posting it because I wanted to have closure, and if anyone else was curious give them closure too. I searched reddit and forums for hours looking for girls in my situation, and sometimes I'd find first posts and then the person would disappear.

1399686969.0,Getting into literature.,"If this is an entirely inappropriate post, just let me know... but I'm trying find a book for my sister.

My sister is graduating high school and I want to get a her a great gift, a book she can read and reread for a long time. We haven't always been close, but I know she's not much into literature. I want to share my love of lit with her, and I thought a good book would do it. She's heading off to college at the end of Summer.

She doesn't have any books in her room at my Dad's, but I saw on Facebook that she likes the Hunger Games series. I'd like to find something with a strong female lead, something with a protagonist she can identify with, and maybe learn something from. Above all though, I need an accessible book. My girlfriend recommended not getting something like Jane Eyre, since it's a pretty dry read.

Personally, I'm very into Fantasy and American Literature. I'm just not sure if that's what she'd like, but I'm open to any and everything (Especially if there's a chance we can discuss and bond over the book).

Any suggestions? ",TwoXChromosomes

1286453935.0,Losing hope with the anti-feminist sentiments on Reddit...,"I really love the Reddit community, but I find myself just getting depressed on the latent and overt feminist hatred on the rest of Reddit.  I'm male, and I do a lot of stereotypical male things, but I really just can't understand it.  Most of Reddit is fairly progressive, and with few exceptions, anyone who makes a racist or homophobic comment is downvoted to hell.  My main complaints are as follows.

There is a misguided perception that women already have equality, and so that anyone pushing for feminism is ""bitchy"" or ""taking it too far"".  Bullshit.  Even after Lilly Ledbetter was passed, women are still making 80 cents on the dollar.  The rate of domestic abuse and sexual assault is criminal.  The number of female faculty in my department is abysmally low.  And that's just in the US.  Pretending that a disadvantaged group has already reached equality seems to be a tactic for all groups, but it's disappointing to see it on Reddit.

Sexual expectations of men require a level of cognitive dissonance that doesn't even make sense.  Almost every post asking, ""What's something nice I can do for my boyfriend/husband?"" will have a top response of ""MOAR BLOWJOBS LOL"", and ""Two chicks at one time"" seems to be a dream for most men.  However when there's a story about a woman who has sex, responses are generally ""She must be a slut because she has daddy issues.""  Any attempts to point this out are usually met with deaf ears and downvotes.

I could go on, but I don't want to mope.  I'm not saying I'm perfect, and honestly I feel pretty average when it comes to defending women's rights, but it's depressing how far away from the Reddit mean I feel on this issue.  I don't buy the stereotypes that Reddit is mostly male, or that they can't get girlfriends as an excuse for female bashing, because the claims are exaggerated, and even if they were true Reddit does some amazing things in other parts of life.  So I'm posting mainly to vent, but also to ask how you deal with this shit, and how, if it is possible, to help Reddit move out of the cave.",TwoXChromosomes
1489846705.0,Today is the one year anniversary of my abortion.,"Today will mark one year since I was pregnant. It wasn‚Äôt planned. I had just started a new job and had gotten sick a couple of times, when I never get sick. I had also felt nauseous every day all day. I thought maybe it was stress. I started to notice I was displaying symptoms of menstruation and thought that was what was happening to me. After a couple of weeks I took a pregnancy test. I actually took it to ease my mind. I never thought I could get pregnant. I have internal issues that make it really difficult and after being in a relationship for 8 years and never getting pregnant while not using any birth control I just figured it wasn‚Äôt going to happen. I bought the test before work and took it on my lunch break. The first thing I said was, ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù. I was terrified. I called my boyfriend. His response was pretty much the same. That night we talked. He was very trepidations about it. We had talked about it years before and I always stated that abortion would be an option but in the more recent years he had told me that he didn‚Äôt think we would need to go that route. In fact just a few months prior to me finding out he had stated that he wanted to get me pregnant. This might have just been sexual banter, but to a woman rapidly approaching the last years of her fertility peak it was nice to hear. As soon as I brought up abortion I could see him feel relief. He was very adamant about it being my decision in the end that he wanted to do what I wanted. I wanted to keep it. But I also wanted to consider all angles. ¬†I knew that if I kept it, he would most likely grow resentful and it would cause issues in our relationship. I also knew that financially we were not prepared. I had just started a new job paying more, but that job requires frequent travel that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do for a long span of time if I remained pregnant. In the end I knew that the best choice would be an abortion. So I scheduled an appointment to have an ultrasound and go from there. I felt really hollow after that, when before I felt hopeful and even called it my little soybean.

¬†

When I got to the clinic there was an older man outside that shouted that Christ loved my baby. I wanted to break down but the nurses let me in quickly and it was dark and quiet in the waiting room, perfect for silent crying. I sat in that waiting room watching old awful Netflix movies with other girls in the same situation. Slowly everyone was called in until they got to me. When they did the ultrasound I asked for a printout. I said that it was probably a weird request but they didn‚Äôt even blink. Pictures are important to me, I take pictures of everything. I guess I just wanted the only picture I could get of my little soybean. I still have that printout in my car. I was only 7 weeks. My due date was Halloween. Because of the state I live in I had to wait until the next day to have the procedure. My boyfriend came with me. Trying to be supportive but I could sense his apprehension. This was all foreign and weird to him. They gave me a vicodin a little before to help with pain and nerves. It didn‚Äôt help much. My boyfriend came in with me, held my hand, but at a distance. He didn‚Äôt want to see anything. I wished he would have been closer. It was painful but not too bad. I just wanted it to be over as quickly as possible. Afterwards they took just me and put me in a room with recliners with the other girls. Everyone had a heating pad and snacks. It would have been a really nice place to just chill, without the circumstances. After a bit I was released and they walked me out to my boyfriend who was waiting for me. We went home and I just wanted to sleep. The weeks following I wasn‚Äôt myself. Throughout the pregnancy I was so overly emotional and I just wanted to start feeling normal again. The nausea had passed, the emotions stayed. Over time I felt better and better. Even thought I never could talk to anyone about it. I lied to the people who had known I was pregnant, said I had a miscarriage. I knew most people wouldn‚Äôt look at me the same if I told the truth. I couldn‚Äôt really talk to my boyfriend either. I think he felt guilty, that somehow the felt that I blamed him. I didn‚Äôt feel that way. It my choice and don‚Äôt regret it. Of course I wish I didn‚Äôt have to have an abortion. No one enjoys that process. But I knew that it was the best option for everyone. I still feel like I can‚Äôt talk about it. I tell him that being sad about it doesn‚Äôt mean that I regret it, but it never makes a difference. I had several friends get pregnant and have babies in the past year. I'm finally getting to the point where I'll even want to hold a baby and not feel like breaking down. I think it'll always be in the back of my mind but in time I'll feel more and more okay with it. 


Today is the the anniversary of my abortion. I‚Äôve been so sad all week. Thursday at 3:45 I started crying and couldn‚Äôt stop. I had to go to the bathroom and gather myself before my co-workers saw. I knew this week would be tough to get through. I even warned my boyfriend weeks ago that the 17th¬†and 18th¬†will be really difficult days. I texted him yesterday saying how today has been rough but I‚Äôm trying to stay positive and just staying busy. His response was, ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. I broke down in tears and had to go to the bathroom to gather myself again. It just killed my heart that he can‚Äôt remember why. It makes me feel like he doesn‚Äôt care. I just wanted the one person who says they love to remember and he doesn‚Äôt. I just want to feel like someone cares.",TwoXChromosomes

You don't want to get political, you don't want to fight because your life and your safety are not at stake.

It is hard and exhausting to bring up issues of oppression (aka ""get political""). The fighting is tiring. I get it. Self-care is essential.

1704475249.0,Dudes crying about how hard they have it when it comes to dating,"***this is a specific complaint about cishet dudes

I‚Äôm poly and there is often discussion about dating apps amongst folks there. Anytime dating apps are mentioned without fail, dudes will start whining about how hard they have it. It‚Äôs always the cishet guys whining, usually married or highly partnered. IME, the absolute *worst* group to date. They suck at communication and treat you like you‚Äôre an inanimate object/fucktoy. I‚Äôve completely given up on dating that group of them. Not because they were unfairly judged by me ahead of time, but specifically because of the consistently terrible experiences I had dating them. There is zero introspection about what dating them is like and if you challenge their self pity their response basically boils down to: they have an expectation that if they game a dating app as a ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù game then they can ‚Äúwin.‚Äù Like it‚Äôs something they are entitled to, they *deserve* a date just because they played the game. When they don‚Äôt, they throw a tantrum (‚Äúno fair!!‚Äù) like a damn child. 


So far the excuses for entitlement to their big sad feelings they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwin‚Äù the numbers game like they expected to are: 

Too many men, not enough women on the apps


Women have it easier in real life (not sure what this has to do with *online* dating prospects, and even if I did, hardcore disagree)


And my personal favorite: 
Dudes just don‚Äôt have good emotional regulation skills. poor us! We are so helpless! Give us allllll the pity! And dates! (Because emotionally stunted is definitely a quality I look for in a date) ü•∫


Like, did any of them at any point in the midst of wallowing stop to consider for even a second **why** women are outnumbered 2:1 by dudes on apps? If women have it so great like they apparently believe we do then explain that stat to me. Because if it was actually that good then surely women would be flocking to join these dating apps, where all they have to do to find quality dudes is exist on it and they can have their pick! The only way dudes can believe that is true is if they are deluding themselves into thinking *they* are the high quality dudes. Right. Ok. 

I‚Äôm so tired of hearing how easy women have it when these dudes never, ever worry for a second we might rape, assault or murder them if they agree to meet us. The day we no longer worry about that is the day I will stop dismissing this argument outright. But for the sake of this post I will unpack this argument. 

Since this almost always is claimed by cishet dudes and is aimed at women, then we can eliminate those *‚Äúthieving‚Äù* lesbians (this is hyperbole and a commentary on fragile dudebro mindsets, not on lesbians. Love y‚Äôall ‚úäüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà)  from stealing their dating prospects and assume that for every one of these women who had it so easy finding a person they want to date, there is a cishet dude who is dating them. If that is true, then the cishet dude had it equally as easy. If it isn‚Äôt true then who are these mythical women dating? Themselves? A mannequin?

Like, ok so maybe since I‚Äôm poly one guy is dating several women. So they‚Äôre mad because I didn‚Äôt choose them? Why is that my fault and what right do they have to be upset with me or women in general  about that? It can only be my fault if they‚Äôre assuming they are perfect and desirable so it must be a flaw on my behalf I didn‚Äôt choose them. Or if they assume my autonomy as a human being is less important than theirs. They should be mad at themselves for not being the catch they think they are! Or be mad at the other dude who is more awesome than them. Or, here‚Äôs an idea: figure out how to grow as a human. Be better, work on yourself, be accountable. If they don‚Äôt wanna it‚Äôs not my problem, it‚Äôs still theirs. 

Expecting women to shoulder the blame or solve the problem for them (date me, I deserve a date!) because they are too lazy and emotionally stunted is not acceptable to women, as evidenced by the lack of dates. This is a problem they have the tools to solve just like women do and I feel exactly zero units of pity for them if they won‚Äôt. Fix yourselves. Fix each other. Fix the mess you created for yourselves and each other by choosing to perpetuate toxic masculinity.",TwoXChromosomes

I was surprised that she said she actually didn't know how she felt about it, but after I aired my piece on it I just feel like we are having the wrong conversation here.

The harsh truth about trans people, is like anyone who is in a minority - no one cares.  The only reason people focus on trans people - especially in bathroom (like seriously what a fucking minute thing to focus on?) - is, in my opinon, a propoganda fueled conspiracy to deflect from the much larger, much more obvious issue which is why the fuck do we have gendered bathrooms in the first place?

We have gendered restrooms because historically speaking, throughout the millennia men rape women while they try to relieve themselves at such a high rate (TO THIS DAY) that we have developed an instinct to go in groups and that to this day we still have gendered restrooms to protect us FROM MEN.  Not trans women.  MEN.  Trans women have never posed a serious threat to... anyone.  Men, however, pose such a great threat to women that we have become mostly blind to the insane hoops we jump through to avoid their violence; for instance: gendered bathrooms.

So, since MEN have created so much violence in bathrooms that we have to have gendered bathrooms and trans women are more likely even than cis women to be assaulted, it just makes sense that they use the female gendered bathroom.  Not because anyone cares about trans people, but out of common fucking sense.  Forcing trans women to use the mens room (that wouldn't even exist if men didn't constantly rape women in bathrooms) is just unneccessary cruelty for the sake of cruelty.  And if you're made uncomfortable by trans women in the womens bathroom take a step back and realize what you're really scared of is MEN in the womens bathroom and why is that?  THAT should be the point of outrage.  Not whether or not trans women should be able to have the same basic safety as everyone else.

Then the fucking obsession with trans people in sports.  Holy fucking hell am I tired of hearing about this one.  First off, this is such a tiny fraction of humanity, get real - anyone who pretends to care about this is manufactured outraged.  Second of all, no one is complaining about trans men in mens sports, only trans women in womens sports.  Frankly, I think a lot of this boils down to mysogyny.  The narrative that a man would actually give up his manhood just to win a fucking sport is insultingly daft.  There isn't a man alive that would prefer to be a woman and definitely would not choose to do so simply to win a sport.  Being a woman sucks.  Being a trans woman - I can only imagine how hard that fucking sucks.  I don't believe for one second anyone would choose that for a trivial reason.  And in my personal opinion, they are such a fucking minority why not just let them play - it should be great having some serious guns on the pink team.  Quit being elitist.

And then the panic about them using womens locker rooms.  You can't be serious.  First off, there's already plenty of homely people in the locker room if you're so concerned with their bodies appearances.  Second of all WHY ARE THERE GENDERED LOCKERROOMS IN THE FIRST PLACE!?  Because MEN rape WOMEN in locker rooms if they get the chance!  So, you're not scared of a trans woman and her stubble.  You're scared of MEN, which they have every right to be scared of, too!  Moreover, it just does not seem like an insurmountable task to put regulation in place for team participation, perhaps pre-op or post-op, I don't know.  I'm not making the laws.  I'm just saying, pretending these are conundrums that are impossible to solve is obvious BS.

Point being: no one is worried about trans violence.  Everyone is worried about mens violence and projecting it onto trans people to deflect from the real discussion: WHY ARE MEN RAPING SO FUCKING MUCH?",TwoXChromosomes

I'm a (24F) white woman who's an intersectional feminist and who has spent a lot of time thinking and reading in my own personal journey of how to be a better intersectional feminist. I've read the following books: hood feminism, poverty by America, emotional intelligence, the body keeps the score, it didn't start with you, Dear Ijeawele or a feminist manifesto in fifteen suggestions, the color purple, the rose that grew from concrete, uncomfortable conversations with a black man, of blood and sweat, and we should all be feminists. Of course I have watched movies (hidden figures, the banker, love jones, a documentary about Dr. Percy Julian to name a few), watch YouTubers (FD Signifier, Khadijah Mbowe, Mayowa's world, I am Eloho to name some) and listened to songs and podcasts as well.

I see a lot of content on my fyp on TikTok and YouTube about the un-helpfulness of white guilt/white tears specifically from white women, more or less how white women make everything worse and act like they care about misogynoir until they get what they need and then dip. 

Seeing all this, I want to learn better techniques to help convert other white women from white feminists into better intersectional feminists. I think it is helpful to have white women addressing the other white women who are not yet intersectional feminists because they will probably be more likely to listen. Despite reading and watching all the content I have about the topics, I don't know a good order of operations or technique to most effectively introduce other white women to these topics. I'm also autistic and have ADHD so I am not good at talking to people, remembering important things, or expressing my thoughts well so that doesn't help my goal. I've tried talking about topics like systemic discrimination, redlining, violence, colorism or hair texturism, reasons for lack of generational wealth among POC with older white women I know but I'm not as successful at creating understanding as I would hope. I think the more specific I am (IE bringing up true examples of a specific historical/famous person's life), the easier it is for other women to understand the concept but that doesn't work every time. So I'd like to hear from any women who have transitioned to being intersectional feminists or helped other women do that. What techniques/books/materials have you have found successful? If you're a woman of color reading this please feel free to respond as well! What changes would make white women better more supportive friends for WOC?

1456798233.0,If I could choose to be a man instead of a woman... this would be why.,"If I had to use one phrase/term to describe the reason, I guess I'd use the term ""sex appeal.""

I don't like over-generalizing so I want to preface this post by saying that I **do not** believe that all women experience what I experience and that all men do not. 

But I hate being a woman because sex appeal is, in my opinion, an anchor on my happiness and prosperity. Since early childhood, in one way or another, I have learned that my primary purpose, duty, and asset as a woman is to be attractive aesthetically. Barbies and Disney princesses set the stage for the general preferred look in the culture I live in. Thin waist, light skin, long, thick hair, decent bust size, small feet, no blemishes, no body hair, good height (not too tall, not too short), nice smile, long eyelashes, and asymmetrical facial features. This is the type of woman that I know society finds worthy. I see her almost exclusively in film, television, magazines, and advertisements. Which is no secret, our society has beauty standards. Every society does.

But it goes deeper than just beauty standards. Everything about being a woman comes down to sex appeal. I've been bullied for being ugly and I've been catcalled while wearing a skirt. I've had a boss ask me not to wear makeup because I look ""slutty"" and I've had a coworker recommend I wear makeup to increase my popularity at work. I've been told to diet and I've been told to eat more. Women are under a lot of pressure to be perfect physically so we do our hair, shave our bodies, shop for relevant outfits... and then we get mocked if we do and if we don't.

Rape and sexual harassment have ties to sex appeal. As a woman, you are a walking sex object at all times. And often, that is regardless of how you look. Even children can have sexual appeal to certain people. At ten years old, I remember a stranger asking me what color my panties were on Neopets.com. The word ""teen"" is one of the most searched terms on porn sites and it makes my skin crawl. As a teen, I was so painfully unaware of my sexual appeal because I was growing into an intelligent, self-sufficient person and was sexually assaulted before I explored my own body. Someone explored my body before me. Which is a fairly common experience for women. As they say, one in four. (and I'm not gonna source that but in my opinion, if it's not one in four, it's more than that. We'll never know. So many cases go unreported.)

In certain parts of the world, women are required to cover themselves from head to toe so as not to inspire lust in men. And when they inspire lust anyway and are sexually assaulted, they are punished. In other parts of the world, women are free to wear what they want and then they too inspire lust in onlookers and are sexually assaulted. And those free women don't always speak up because they might also be punished. I don't think women inspire lust in those perpetrators. The lust is there from the start. Our culture grows and grooms the lust in rapists and sexual assaulter's by constantly affirming the idea that women are here for sex. 

So much of the things that I've been told all come back to the fact that I am on Earth for sex. Save your virginity for marriage, wear long enough shorts to school so they don't kick you out of class, shave your legs/arms, don't walk home alone at night, smile when people talk to you, wear dress pants/suits to work so your coworkers take you more seriously, don't wear granny panties even if that is what makes you the most comfortable...

I'm losing my mind! I want it to end! I can't get away from it. Ever. When I saw the new Star Wars in theaters, someone yelled ""Ew! She's old!"" when Carrie Fischer appeared on the screen and the internet freaked out at the fact that she aged. I've been terrified of aging since I turned seventeen. I'm 21 now and I feel like every day, I'm a little less attractive than I was. And I freak out because my worth as a human is going down. Now, I know it's not really but it can feel like it. So much.

Obviously the internet can't help you escape it. In every Reddit link I click on with a woman in the picture, one of the top comments is ALWAYS whether or not that woman is hot. If you post a picture of yourself, Redditors will either check your history for GoneWild posts or message you for pics of your body. 

Fuck being a woman. I hate it. And I know men have issues as well but I really want to say that most men have an identity outside of being a sex object. And women overcome the fact that society wants one thing from us. But you never forget it. 

tldr: Being a women fucking sucks sometimes.

First of all, stop appraising my child's looks in a creepy way. You want to remark while passing me in a grocery store that he's cute or smile at him? Fine. But don't make weird comments about how his looks affect him. 

Second of all, what does that even mean? That looks don't matter for guys but do for girls? Is she implying that his future job success, love success, etc. won't be influenced by his looks but that if he were female they would? Isn't that an odd thing to say to a stranger?

As the mom of two delicious, delightful little kids who happen to both be boys, I can honestly say my perspective about life has changed. I used to read reports about girls doing better in school or graduating at higher rates than boys and think, 'rah, rah, rah, girls!' But at this point, my future vested interest is strictly in male progress. That doesn't mean I hope girls stop succeeding--it just means that I don't cheer on advancements for girls that disadvantage boys.

1291356970.0,Dear TwoXChromosomes...,"I'm done with you.

It's not just you, it's both of us. I subscribed to this subreddit for not really any reason except for the fact that I'm female and it might be nice to read more girls' posts on Reddit. I wasn't looking for anything exceptional or wonderful, just a place to talk about womanly things. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for equality of both genders and there was a fair share of menstruation and make up discussions, but some posts in TwoXChromosomes leave a bad taste in my mouth.

I've tired of being constantly downvoted for stating my opinion that differs with what most of you think. I would like to think that it's nobody's fault - maybe my views on life don't fit into this subreddit. But TwoXChromosomes has the biggest case of hivemind I've seen on Reddit so far (with maybe the exception of Mensrights). Some of the ""discussions"" I've been a part of here have made me so frustrated, I'm cranky for the rest of the day over some petty internet argument.

So I'm leaving to reduce my hate over the stupid little downward spirals I find myself caught in so often here. There are some wonderful and intelligent people in TwoXChromosomes, but they don't make up for the people who posts pictures of fat chicks and try to make people feel guilty for ever not thinking that she is a beautiful and unique snowflake. They don't make up for the catty and illogical comments that only further the woman stereotype. So what if I find this woman ugly. It's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it. How about making yourself a better person (physically and mentally) instead of focusing your attention towards the people who will continue to make fun of you no matter how much you try to make them feel ashamed.

I don't know if anybody else feels the same, but I this point, I really could not care less. I would have not normally made a post like this, but I seem to have a lot of pent-up frustration towards TwoXChromosomes.

Just gonna kind of go on a little rant I guess. So as you can probably guess by the title, I'm trans and I'm also a woman.

I know it isn't good for my mental health but I often find myself reading through long comment threads, and finding something to get angry or sad about. What hurts me so much is it seems so easy to do this and run into transphobia anywhere I look, even when gender or sex isn't remotely related to whatever was originally being discussed. I see people calling me a man or saying I'll never be a woman. People calling me slurs. People accuse me of wanting to take away women's rights even though I'm a woman and need safe spaces too. I feel like so many people refuse to see me for who I am and it hurts so much. It makes me feel like I don't exist. It makes me mad at myself for being ""different"". When really I just wish I was the most normal girl there was.

It's hard being a woman and knowing I can never have kids because I would really like to be able. It's hard being a woman and not having a uterus, it feels like a piece of me is missing. It's hard being a woman when some people don't see you as one. It's hard being a woman and having gone through the wrong puberty with changes that are either irreversible or only correctible with expensive surgeries. I just want to be treated like normal.

When people remind me of my birth sex it hurts me. That part isn't important to me. I feel like they're reducing me to what my chromosomes say and are ignoring my whole personhood.

Anyway, that's about the end of this little rant. Was kind of brought on by me seeing a youtube video with lots of hateful comments. I'd love to have a conversation with anyone in the comments below.

I got into a fight with a dude at a bar over the last scene in the last Game of Thrones. He claimed that because Sansa made the decision to marry that sicko that what she experienced on their wedding night wasn't ""really"" rape. Oh and he said that it wasn't rape because it didn't happen ""in that world."" Like, really? It makes me furious that instead of saying, ""Wow that's a fucked up world where a woman finds that the BEST decision she can make for herself is to enter a relationship in which she will likely get raped,""he goes with, ""Well she knew what was up so him forcing himself on her isn't technically rape."" WHAT. THE. FUCK. 

I get that Sansa's situation was VERY different from Dany's in the first season because she only married in the HOPES that it would give her some power later on, whereas Dany was basically sold off by her brother for HIS power. But Sansa's isn't guaranteed power and it's unlikely that she will only have to be physically forced to have sex once. (The dude argued that Sansa knew this needed to happen in order for the marriage to be consummated so that she can become Warden of the North or whatever.) 

I hit my boiling point was when he kept saying it ""wasn't real life."" But for a lot of real, human, breathing women this IS their life. They feel that their only option is to stay with an abuser because it's the least shitty situation to be in. It's not like life for women in the ""real world"" is some haven of equality where we couldn't even FATHOM being raped by men who call themselves our husbands. If we do not consent it is rape.

1414782150.0,"Ladies, Can we not use the term 'Neckbeard' and avoid 'fedora wearing' as derogatory?","So, disclaimer.  I consider myself fairly active in feminist community. I totally think it's about equality, not about men being assholes. I am a feminist, I am an egalitarian and I really don't think those two are exclusionary. 

**Frankly, I think the term 'neckbeard' is fat shaming**. Plain and simple. There are many men out there who I believe use beards as a way to mask their second chin. I feel like it's not a stereotype that's remotely true, so it's not even useful in discussion. 

**Truthfully, I'm not crazy about the 'fedora' association either**. Typically - I think there's an association of fedoras to misogyny because fedoras are not socially acceptable and so people who wear things that aren't socially acceptable are more likely to have socially unacceptable views. 

1. I just don't think these are any better (possibly even much worse) than the 'basic bitch' stereotype.  Because being a basic bitch associates boring with leggings and uggs (not to mention cultural appropriation, but I digress) but associating something like fedoras and neckbeards associates these men to actively bad people and can alienate them. 

2. By labeling something and assigning a negative connotation to something, we actually may alienate the person and push them into that group, because that group might be the only person would accept them. 

I don't see it horribly often on here, but just frequently enough that I wanted to mention it.

I'm new to skateboarding and don't trust myself to maneuver around them, so I step off of my board and walk past them. It wasn't very graceful, admittedly, but I didn't fall or hit them so I was happy. One of them says ""savage alert"" to make fun of my lack of boarding skills...

1435176696.0,Catcalling while running vent,"An experience a few nights ago that left me stewing prompted me to get my thoughts down on ‚Äúpaper‚Äù. I‚Äôm hoping that by examining how I feel and taking in all the possible opinions and perspectives, that I‚Äôll stop being so angry about it. 

First of all, I‚Äôm not a perfect feminist. I have flirted and acted stupid to get out of tickets and have used my feminine charm to my advantage. The difference is that I‚Äôm not hurting anyone else in the process. The people that help me have a choice. They could still write me the ticket or tell me they won‚Äôt tape my box for me at the post office free of charge.

So, to the men who thinks it‚Äôs okay to yell at me and my friends when I‚Äôm out walking or running: It‚Äôs gross. I don‚Äôt appreciate it. It‚Äôs not flattering. Please stop. You‚Äôre teaching younger generations of males that this is acceptable behavior, and you are convincing them that it‚Äôs at the very least, humorous and at the very most, appreciated. It‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre teaching younger generations of females that this is the kind of behavior that they should expect when they leave the house. And it shouldn‚Äôt be.

I have recently gotten back into running and walking outdoors now that the weather is nice and the roads and sidewalks aren‚Äôt covered in a thick sheet of winter or that disgusting mixture of snow, salt in dirt that is the months of March and April. What remains is pavement and gravel and my beautifully obnoxious neon sneakers. 
When I‚Äôm by myself, I typically run with giant headphones. These headphones serve a duel purpose. They blast the likes of Britney Spears into my ears, giving me that sweet motivation to keep going, but they also block out the sounds of cat-calling.

For those of you who think that I and other women are exaggerating, I assure you, we are not. It happens frequently.  Most of the times, the things said are not very imaginative, ‚ÄúHey baby!‚Äù or ‚ÄúLooking good!‚Äù, sometimes they are lewd, ‚ÄúNice ass!‚Äù or ‚ÄúRunning does that body good!‚Äù, and as the other night‚Äôs experience proves, they can be downright scary/creepy, ‚ÄúHey! Do you need a ride? Have you ever wanted to ride in a U-Haul?‚Äù (I‚Äôm not kidding. That‚Äôs literally what was said.)

The headphones block most of it out. Most often, by the time I realize I‚Äôm being cat-called, it just sounds like yelling, my attention is diverted, and I see a guy leaning out his window giving me some sort of thumbs up or sticking his tongue out suggestively. 

I‚Äôve gotten a couple of reactions when I complain about it, and how it makes me feel. Most of the time, I‚Äôm given a sympathetic understanding and a ‚ÄúThat sucks.‚Äù And if I‚Äôm complaining to women, nearly 100% of the time, they have a matching story or 12. 

However, I‚Äôve also been given lots of responses that are less than supportive. They pretty much fall into these three categories.

-‚ÄúWell, what were you wearing?‚Äù  (AKA You should change the way you look and this will be avoided.)
Ah. A classic. It never gets old. Except that IT‚ÄôS SUPER, SUPER, OLD. I could go ON AND ON about how this is a ridiculous form of victim blaming, but really, people (I almost wrote women, but ya know what, this applies to men too) should be able to wear whatever they want without comments from other people. 

Now, I‚Äôm not one who thinks that people should be able to wear whatever they want without any consequences. If you wear a short skirt or low cut top‚Ä¶or perhaps some hotpants and tights that look like thigh highs (*COUGH* DERBY *COUGH*) people will look. People will judge.  And I personally just don‚Äôt care about that. Look all you want. I‚Äôm in public. Judge all you want to as well. However, I‚Äôm not interested in your opinion. I don‚Äôt care what it is either way. I don‚Äôt need your approval, nor do I need your judgment. I dress the way  I dress for me. When it comes to running, I‚Äôm going to be comfortable. It‚Äôs also summer, and it‚Äôs hot, and excuse me, but I didn‚Äôt feel like breaking out my running Burka. (Though it should be noted that I‚Äôd still probably get comments for that, but they‚Äôd probably be racist in addition to sexist.)

-‚ÄúWell, at least you‚Äôre being paid attention to./What do you expect? You‚Äôre hot.‚Äù  (AKA You should expect this because men can‚Äôt help themselves)
     Oh good. Now we‚Äôre trying to make attractive girls feel like it‚Äôs their fault for being objectified because they were born attractive and/or stay in shape. Now THAT seems productive. Do we really have to wonder why the self-confidence of girls and women is abysmally low? This statement is literally shaming girls into thinking they deserve this because they are being deemed attractive. Not only do we deserve this, but we should be FLATTERED by it. As my bestie pointed out, ‚ÄúI also find the idea that male attention is something that we should strive for and be flattered by pretty insulting.‚Äù YUP. Well, gee, Mister flat brim hat gold chain seems to think I‚Äôm attractive. Better keep running so that other gold chains can comment on my tits. This is the comment I get often from women, which is almost more infuriating. Ladies, stop competing with your friends. You‚Äôre all hot and beautiful  and sexy  in different ways.   

-‚ÄúIt‚Äôs harmless. Just ignore it.‚Äù (AKA You‚Äôre overreacting/you‚Äôre crazy)
     Ok, but it‚Äôs not harmless though. I very rarely get on my high horse about male privilege because my brand of feminism is not to tear down men, but to build women up. I want equality. And equality means that I want to be able to decide to go for a run and NOT HAVE TO FEAR BEING SEXUALLY OBJECTIFIED OR ASSAULTED. Regardless of what I wear or don‚Äôt wear, do or don‚Äôt do, the worry about being cat-called and objectified is THERE. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs men‚Äôs FAULTS that they don‚Äôt have to worry about it, you can‚Äôt help that you were born with a penis, but what male privilege is in this instance is recognizing that women are consciously aware of this ALL THE TIME. There is no male equivalent of this. If a man were to be cat-called, it would be surprising, and sadly, it‚Äôs gotten to the point where it doesn‚Äôt surprise me anymore. I almost expect it.  It doesn‚Äôt happen 24/7. This has been a weird week having it happen more than once, but the point is, is that it COULD happen daily, and we are subconsciously worried all the time.

More importantly, it bothers *me*. And regardless of whether or not you think I‚Äôm overreacting, I‚Äôm entitled to my feelings. Please don‚Äôt ever dismiss someone‚Äôs emotions. Even if you can‚Äôt understand why they are upset, just accept that they ARE and ask how you can help. Most of the time, that just means listening to what they‚Äôre saying and telling them that it sucks that they feel sad/scared/upset/angry and you wish that they didn‚Äôt have to feel that way.  

 
Lastly, this is not a complaining brag. A lot of women don‚Äôt talk about this, because they think it comes across as saying, ‚ÄúLook how many men think I‚Äôm hot!‚Äù That is NOT what this is. It‚Äôs also not a rant to gain your sympathy. I‚Äôm a very independent woman who does not need your pity.  This is just to TELL YOU. I just want you to know that this happens to someone you know and I‚Äôm not okay with it. Ever.

Realistically, a large proportion of women cannot easily lift and carry 50 pounds repetitively without injury. The vast majority of men are not going to have an issue with doing this kind of lifting. (Sorry, I know this is a general statement and I realize that more testosterone or more muscle mass does not equate to male ‚Äì just that on average, men are physically stronger and more muscular than women)

I get why the requirement exists, I do. I get it‚Äôs necessary for retail workers to be able to lift and carry heavy things sometimes. And I hate the stereotype of women not being strong enough to lift things, because there are certainly plenty of women who are muscular and have no problem lifting heavy things. But it‚Äôs quite frustrating to have this as a job requirement for entry level retail positions that aren‚Äôt even meant to be centered on physical labor. It seems covertly sexist.

I don‚Äôt understand why so many companies now just decide to have everyone play the role of stocking and unloading the truck instead of just having an actual designated stocker as a job position. That used to be normal. Is it just not a thing anymore?

**EDIT:** I know that there are women that can lift 50 pounds repeatedly without a problem. I would never assume another woman can or can‚Äôt lift something; that would be blatantly sexist. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying at all and I genuinely apologize if it came off that way.

I‚Äôm talking about the population as a whole, and my frustration is with the fact that in general/on average, women are more likely to struggle with this kind of repetitive lifting and are more prone to injury because of it. I‚Äôm finding it frustrating to find a job just to get me through college that doesn‚Äôt have this as a requirement, and it‚Äôs hard to figure out whether it implies repetitive lifting or just lifting something occasionally.

The thing is, she works in a hospital (for more than three years pre-covid) currently working in a covid ward, and is germaphobic to start with but has persevered through the whole pandemic. I know she has had a lot of issues personally and professionally in the past two years and has been struggling, and I promise I have tried to support her as much as I can. 
I personally went through stress-induced weight loss years ago, and was still dealing with it when I met my partner so I was a little taken aback when they said I should be congratulating her. She didn't post publically or mention a thing to me about venturing to lose weight. Not a single selfie, motivational quote, exercise post, nothing. 
The most uncomfortable, anxiety inducing thing to me during my weight loss period was people commenting about how 'fit' I looked, or saying ""wow, you look amazing!"" And having to thank them for their nice words after spending the morning, afternoon and evening throwing up anything I had eaten because of anxiety.
My partner could not understand why I wasn't celebrating her weight loss instead of making sure she was okay, or just loving and accepting her for who she is, and this needs to be a societal shift of perception. Please PLEASE don't make comments on someone's weight loss/change of appearance unless they talk about it positively or you know for a fact it was intentional. Sometimes it is NOT intentional and the more you draw attention to it the harder it is for the person to deal with, especially if they gain back (healthy) weight later on.

He also read news stories about male teachers facing more and more risks of being accused of molesting kids, and that airlines are forbidding men from sitting next to unaccompanied minors.

1538849464.0,This is not an open letter to Susan Collins (But it should be),"For 29 years I have been proud to say I was from the great state of Maine.

In 2008 I voted for Susan Collins‚Äîin 2008 I went to a house party off-campus from the University of Maine. 

It was a tame party: we had cheap beer and store brand soda. We had pirated tv on a hard drive that would seem tiny by today‚Äôs standards.

Most of us spent the night.

I managed to get a spot on the sofa sleeper, sharing it with a man I only sort of knew. I woke up before the sun rose with a different man‚Äôs hands on my breast, in my pants.

I didn‚Äôt move.

The man next to me stayed asleep, drunk and snoring with it. His arm was pressed against mine.

Sometimes, I have dreams that he was awake, that he held me down. My subconscious wants me to have fought my attacker nearly as much as popular discourse does.

I pray that he never has dreams about me. I know it wasn‚Äôt his fault he didn‚Äôt wake up, but who knows what he might have picked up on despite his drunken slumber.

Some things about that morning are so vivid in my mind I could paint them with pinpoint accuracy. The gray pre-dawn light picked out the room with a perfect beauty that Ansel Adams would have envied. My attacker‚Äôs tongue tasted sweet, like he‚Äôd been eating candy. The sheets on the sofa sleeper smelled musty and dry.

Some things I‚Äòve lost in the intervening decade. The names of half the people who were there are gone. I can‚Äôt even name the man who‚Äôd passed out next to me on that sofa sleeper. I don‚Äôt remember the address, or how many bedrooms there were. I‚Äôm only barely sure it wasn‚Äôt an apartment.

When my attacker finished, he went to the bathroom and turned on the sink. I fixed my clothes and woke my best friend.

She didn‚Äôt ask why we were leaving at dawn on a Sunday; I didn‚Äôt tell.

I remember I couldn‚Äôt afford the taxi we had to take home because the bus service wasn‚Äôt running yet. I don‚Äôt remember whether we paid with cash or a card or an IOU.

It‚Äôs been a decade, and I‚Äôm uncertain about a lot of the finer details. I‚Äôm uncertain, sometimes, whether it was really rape, since I never said no.

I‚Äôve never told anyone any of this. It hurts to keep it a secret, but I know it would hurt more, immeasurably and irrevocably more, if I told someone and they didn‚Äôt believe me.

Sometimes I think it‚Äôs the sort of secret that will die with me. Sometimes I think it‚Äôs the secret that will kill me.

But I know with a profound certainty that if I live long enough, and if he lives long enough. If one day my secret became a matter of national interest, whether the nation understood it or not, I would be morally compelled to share it.

In 2008 I was proud to vote for a powerful woman for U. S. Senator. Republicans don‚Äôt produce a lot of them, and I thought one day I might become one.

In 2018, I‚Äôm sick with how glad I am that I‚Äôm just another entitled millennial woman in a batch of millions, because at least we acknowledge that rape victims aren‚Äôt always perfect, and that rapists don‚Äôt deserve to guide national policy for decades to come.

For 29 years, I had been proud to say I was from the great state of Maine.

I think I got the basics down already, like don't make her oversexualized and don't give her the personality of a cardboard box, but I feel I need a bit more to go off of.  I've watched the YouTube game reviewer known as Anita Sarkeesian and she claims that games like mirrors edge and the tomb raider reboot are bad because it put the leads in danger.  I personally enjoyed those games because I always favored the lead to be closer to human like me.  But she and Tumblr believe that female lead in action games should not fall or get hurt very little in their games.  I myself don't like this idea because I like seeing the hero make mistakes or get hurt but ultimately rise above it, it's an inspiring thing to see and not just in video games, it's not as fun to see the hero always get it right and never struggle, because then it becomes predictable.  But what do you guys think, what would make a good female lead in your eyes.

1401528986.0,"[Suggestion] The expression ""virgin"" considered harmful (and how we could do something about it)","Is it just me, or does anyone else think it's messed up that we have a specific word for ""person with zero sexual partners""? I was thinking about this a few days ago, and to me the expression ""virgin"" is just as destructive as ""slut"" for our culture.

Basically, there are two very negative forms of usage for this word:

* Objectification of women by judging their past in a very primitive way

* Pushing young men to create sexual situations that often become uncomfortable for everyone involved, including the guy (for example, if he feels the pressure to initiate sex when he doesn't want to)

There's no socially constructive purpose at all for this expression. It is one of the most antisocial words that we have in our vocabulary.

In many cases, the impact on an individual's life is not greater when going from 0 to 1 partner, as when going from 1 to 2, and so on (especially when it comes to flings and shorter relationships).

**So, what would be a good way to do something about it?**

I have this idea that this word could be ""disarmed"" if everyone started to use it in totally different and incompatible ways. For example, sex-ed teachers could casually suggest different meanings for each school class.

* Some would think it means ""fewer than 5 partners""

* Some would think it means ""fewer than 10""

* Some would think it means ""never been kissed""

* Some would think it means ""never felt attracted to someone""

* Etc.

Then, the word would become worthless for the purpose of communicating the expression it today is associated with (and thus relieving society of an annoying burden from the more conservative eras).

I am away on business (my job requires weekly travel), and my collegues and I decided to end a long day with a drink. A (male) friend of mine (let's call him X) shot me a text saying he was also in town, so of course I invite him along.

After bar closure we decide pizza and drinks at the hotel would be a fun way to prolong the evening, which was going fantastically. We have a few local friends over for a slice and some laughs. X says he needs to get going because his flight home was in the morning. I thought it was also time I hit the hay as the long day and the alcohol was kicking in. So we leave my collegue's room together. I was just down the hall and as I go for the hug goodbye, X lunges in for the kiss.

I was stunned, in shock, then pushed him away saying ""This is NOT okay."" I was oddly calm at first, then a fiery anger took hold of me. ""What the hell do you think you're doing? What makes you think this is okay?"" Then the aftershock of tears poured out ""What the hell man? You're my friend! You can't just do that! I have a boyfriend! You KNOW my boyfriend! What the hell am I supposed to tell him now??"" Then I took a step back and tried reasonning it out. ""Listen I think you're a great guy but I'm in a relationship that I am not willing to compromise..""

In the mean time X look guilt-ridden and blubbers out ""I'm so incredibly in love with you. I just.. I want you so bad. I'm sorry... I'm really sorry.... you're so incredible and mean the world to me and please don't be upset I'm sorry.....""

I told him I couldn't deal with this right now and needed time to deal with what had just happened.

This morning I feel stupid. I knew this guy had some attraction to me as it had been mentionned in the past ""Your boyfriend is a lucky man, you're such a catch. I envy him."" Etc etc. I feel like I should have had a bigger guard up. I feel betrayed from a friend; He made a move I was not okay with, without my permission. I feel loss at our friendship as I don't know if I'll ever be able to face him alone (and we had been close friends). I feel anger at him crossing the line. I feel guilt at having betrayed my boyfriend, whether you consider it my fault or not. I feel sadness at not being able to provide my friend with the love he direly wants (as odd as it sounds, I feel bad for him, and he just got out of an abusive relationship). In an alternate reality we may have ended up together; He is someone I really care about and he was good to me as I was to him, but I have been in a long term relationship as long as we have known eachother. And I had drawn the line very clearly in the past because I am in love with my boyfriend and I would do anything to protect the relationship, but a side of me can't blame X for wondering the ""what ifs"" because I had thought about it too; I just never dreamed of acting on it. (Rereading this paragraph I realize it's all over the place but honestly I don't know how to make heads or tails of these thoughts and it's hard to word them out.)

I called my boyfriend and he took it like a champ. He is happy I stood my ground and makes nothing more of it that I had the oppertunity to cheat on him and did not take it. Although I appreciate his non-chalance and his support, I am still in a turmoil of emotions.

Similarly, I've been here long enough to know that TwoX has one solid definition for sexism, and that's *sexism = power + prejudice based on gender.* Along with that comes the understanding that reverse sexism can't exist, since women don't have the necessary institutionalized power and privilege that inherently come with being a man.  

If you adhere to what I wrote above, by all means you understand why it works the same for racism. You understand it, but you might deny it because for once it's *your* privilege being questioned, privilege you don't think you have. But if I put it this way:  

>Racism = power + prejudice based on skin color. Along with that comes the understanding that reverse racism can't exist, since people of color don't have the necessary institutionalized power and privilege that inherently coming with being white.  

shouldn't it then become clear? To claim ""reverse racism"" both diminishes and minimalizes the real and actual experiences of PoC who really do encounter racism. It tries to delegitimize the emotions and efforts of those who work for racial equality, and to undercut their efforts.  

Lastly, just in terms of subreddits, clearly TwoX exists in part as a for women's perspectives.

When you need to talk to your SO, or have asked them to do something, or you're running late for another engagement, and your SO says, ""There's only 5 minutes left in the game!"" know that this is a misdirection.

You might look at the game clock and confirm, yes, 5 minutes. But then you find yourself still waiting, 10 minutes later. What happened? When you question your SO about the 3 minutes remaining on the clock, they may deploy football jargon, like ""they just lost possession at the 10, but after this drive the kicker will have a shot. That will end the game.""

This is another misdirection. Football clocks only run when the players are running. As far as I can tell, they run for about 10% of the actual screentime. According to my calculations, the last 5 minutes of a football game can take anywhere from 10 minutes to six hours.

1684830806.0,A message from a trans woman to the cis women here so you can hopefully understand us better,"Hello. I think I need to address something that I see too often when I and other trans women are talking to other cis women about our experiences, and I want to get it across here.

&#x200B;

Something I get when I talk to cis women, both online and IRL, is them telling me that I'm lucky that I don't have a period, don't have a uterus, and can't get pregnant. I understand where this is coming from. Please do not think that we trans women don't comprehend how much a period sucks. Ok, maybe we can't even fully comprehend it, but we can do our best to try and empathize with what AFAB people go through every month. So when you ask me, do I really want to go through excruciating pain for a few days a month every month between tween years to around 50? My answer is both yes and no. No because obviously that sucks, but yes because of what a period actually means - it means that the uterus and ovaries are there and functioning correctly. Its an indication that I would have a working female body. That symbolic meaning is why when someone tells us ""you're lucky you don't have a period"", its actually more hurtful than you might think. Its a reminder to us that we don't have a uterus, and we cannot get pregnant and bear children if we want to (while I personally don't want to get pregnant because I know going through 9 months of having another living being growing in your body is difficult, painful, and can have a lasting impact on your health, I wish I had the option to be able to in case I changed my mind in the future about bearing a child in the future. As of now, such is impossible for me and its pretty saddening).

&#x200B;

I think most cis women somewhat take their bodies for granted, and frankly, I don't even blame you all. Its been your body your whole life, and being cis, you've probably never felt out of place with your body's sex and wished to have a body of a different sex. I get the feeling that a lot of cis women don't even fully love their bodies for the reasons above as well as other things (sexualization from men, back pain from potentially larger breasts, just to name a couple examples). So I think that may be why its hard to understand why us trans women wish we had that so bad. The one thing I envy above all that cis women have, even moreso than their bodies (especially as I'm starting to learn to love my own), is the very fact that they are cis. While I know there are exceptions, for the most part, society will never question your gender identity. You will never have to ""prove"" to anyone that you're a real woman. You won't have to fight tooth and nail to be able to access the medical treatments to correct your body's sex, and while I know AFAB puberty is pretty rough, you'll never experience the literal body horror of your body masculinizing and become *male* against your will as you know its wrong but can only sit back and watch. You don't have to deal with your parents rejecting you, refusing to respect you, and threatening you over something that's out of your control. You will never have to worry about going into a public restroom and being harassed or even arrested. All of that comes with being cis, and its things that I've fought hard to have, and may not be able to keep in the future with how things are looking politically. And worst of all, I've had to fight my own doubts about who I am. I fight imposter syndrome every day, wondering if I'm valid as a real girl or just a man who has a crazy fantasy? I'm terrified of making one wrong move and potentially losing my other female friends who accept me as a woman, and I have lost female friends IRL who have turned out to be TERFs and have called me slurs and publicly called me out online.

&#x200B;

So if you're a cis woman here, even if you are comfortable in your female gender identity, even if you have problems with your body, I'm telling you this - you *do not* wish you were born male, and while I understand that sentiment from a lot of cis women, next time you think of saying that to a trans woman, think about the implications of what you're saying and how hard she has fought just to be able to live as her genuine self. And understand this. Many of us have had to live in the wrong body for years, and only some of us are lucky enough to be able to access the necessary healthcare to correct our body, and even if we can access it, depending on age, genetics, and the quality of our doctors, its not even guaranteed to completely correct our bodies. And even for the few of us who are lucky enough that we pass consistently and can live stealth, as amazing as medical transition is today, its still not perfect - we can get about 80-85% of the way there and get our bodies to be clearly female, but we still cannot finish and get that last part - having our bodies able to naturally produce estrogen, and have our bodies able to give birth.

&#x200B;

And I'll leave you all with this. Trans women don't transition because we think the grass is genuinely greener on the other side for women. We full well know its not, and that cis women still face a ton of oppression compared to men in society. Combine this with how bad trans people in general are treated, and then consider the fact that we still went ahead with this. Despite all that we've had to go through, we are still happier being able to live as our genuine selves. Try and put yourself in our shoes and try to understand our journey and why we did this.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - To all the cis women here - you do not want to be trans. You do not want to have been born in an AMAB body. I am not trying to discount how much periods or pregnancy suck, but when you tell a trans woman she's lucky that she can't experience those things, think twice about what the implications of saying that are, because to us, its a sad reminder that our bodies will never be quite as we wish they were, and we may never get to live a peaceful life as a cis woman without the world constantly questioning who we are.

&#x200B;

Edit: Please do not take this as a ""You're lucky you're a cis woman"". My goal here was to try and explain some of the unique challenges trans women face that cis women may not have to. While I do wish I was cis, I understand that if I was, I'd probably still have lots of issues with my body, and I haven't gone through some of the challenges that cis women have. This was not meant to invalidate any of your own challenges. ",TwoXChromosomes
1612557376.0,I feel like most straight men aren't actually romantically attracted to women,"I'm truly starting to think that most straight men aren't actually romantically attracted to women, only sexually/physically. And here's why.

Practically every guy I have ever come across, whether that be in real life or online, is a self-proclaimed ""very sexual person"". They view sex as the most important thing in a relationship, far more important than a great emotional connection. They categorically won't date women who are asexual or have low sex drives, no matter how much they like her as a person. I'm speaking from personal experience here too: every time I tell a guy I'm talking to that I'm grey-asexual (which doesn't mean that I never want to have sex btw, just that I don't experience sexual attraction very often),  no matter how great we had been getting along, they instantly lose interest. Now, I'm not denying that sex is an important part of a relationship, of course it is, but it shouldn't be the be all and end all of one if you have strong romantic feelings for the person.

Moreover, the proportion of men who want serious relationships compared to women is staggeringly lower, and the proof is in the pudding with dating apps, where probably around 95% of male users are only looking for hookups. It's a common phenomenon for men on dating apps to pretend to be interested in a woman, sleep with her, and then ghost her immediately after, yet the reverse is practically unheard of. And even men who do want relationships often only want them for the guaranteed regular sex, rather than because they actually want to fall in love and build a life together with someone.

A lot of straight men actually ***hate*** women as people. That's why they constantly do things like sexually harass and assault women, deny that sexual assault is as much of an issue as it really is, victim blame, defend abusers, mansplain us, gaslight us, slut shame us, think we're stupid, etc. Gay men treat women better and respect us more than straight men do, and they're not even attracted to us. One thing is for certain, the way that lesbians and bi/pansexual women feel about and treat women, is completely different to the way straight men do.

Essentially, it just seems to me like the majority of straight men are incapable of being romantically attracted to women, or even viewing us as full human beings for that matter. So many of them just view women as sexual objects to use to get themselves off and nothing more. Obviously there are exceptions, but genuine romantic attraction is something that most straight men seem to never experience. And even if they claim that they do experience it, the reality is that if you told most of these men that sex was off the table with a woman they ""like"", their ""feelings"" for her would disappear in 0.01 seconds. I just cannot fathom that the way men feel about women in TV shows, movies and books, ever happens in real life.

TL;DR: Due to their prioritisation of sex over anything else, and the ways in which they view and treat women, I find it hard to believe that most straight men are actually romantically attracted to women.",TwoXChromosomes

I think using ‚Äúfemales‚Äù when referring to people, where there is no reason to make a biological distinction between one person and another, is problematic. I think it‚Äôs problematic because it‚Äôs reductive and exclusionary. Reductive because it reduces a person to their sexual organs, and exclusionary because, by being  reductive, those who identify as women, but who do not have female sexual organs, are excluded. 

Am I seeing a trend that doesn‚Äôt exist ? Does anyone else think this is problem? Does anyone think it‚Äôs a good idea? Is it something not worth another thought?

1460552795.0,I'm being abused by my husband,"I'm a grown woman undergoing ivf for the first (and only) time and I'm being emotionally, psychologically and verbally abused by my husband because I'm not acting the way he wants/expects me to act. On the way home from the final transfer last week he called me a cunt and a bitch because I was quiet and upset from the experience and made a comment about windshield wipers. That turned into me punching myself in the stomach (I will not bring a child into this abusive environment) and he reacted by grabbing and shaking/punching me like a rag-doll. I ended up with a strained neck, scratches on my neck and bruises all over my neck and head.  He said he was trying to stop me from hurting myself. He is 6'5 and I am 5'1. Later that day he called me a murderer and told me he wished I would kill myself and that he couldn't wait for me to die. When the test comes back negative he will blame me for killing it (he blames me for the first one not working).  I am very depressed and obviously not dealing with things very well. He knows this and has absolutely no mercy on me. The abuse is getting worse. I sought help recently because of the thoughts I'm having and was told I likely have lingering borderline personality disorder and I'm on a waiting list for treatment but right now I'm just existing and doing the best I can.  This just angers him which leads to more abuse.  When I tell him I am depressed and having suicidal thoughts he tells me to go and kill myself, he will be happier when I'm gone, he will finally have sex again and nobody will miss me because I have alienated myself from everybody that did care. He tells me my family doesn't love me. It's always my fault. He convinced me to quit my well paying job a couple months ago in order to undergo ivf treatment/become a stay at home mom and since then, if I don't act a certain way he gets very angry and always throws it back in my face. He takes pleasure in doing this. He tells me I'm fucked and in the same breath berates me when I am in the dumps. He thinks I'm faking all this. When I cry he yells at and tells me to stop as he continues to berate and torture me. Avoiding him only makes him angrier. He yelled at me this morning because I haven't been waking up with him to say good morning and to make his lunches, I haven't been making dinner, or cleaning the house as he expects now that I'm not working anymore. He tells me he regrets ever meeting me and accuses me of being the reason for all our financial issues. He hates me and doesn't even deny it. He hasn't hugged me or said anything nice to me since the transfer last week. He has no compassion, just hate. He is a monster. I am not without fault but nobody deserves to be tortured like this, especially when I am undergoing this treatment for him. I have nothing to look forward too. I have nothing left. I am nobody. Soon I will say farewell to this awful existence. I'm just trying to make it through the week. I am not looking for anything by posting this, I just needed to let this out.

1605527427.0,No! Men DO NOT and SHOULD NOT have a say in a woman's abortion! Jesus Christ that we even need to talk about!,"Just been back from a guy who said exactly that.

""If the woman wants an abortion, the man usually has no say in it at all, which makes him a lesser parent automatically. I'm not sure how to do that differently but I think it's kind of messed up that it is that way.""

Honestly; while the topic of abortion is very complicated (and I'm not going to start a debate on it, because that'll only end in war) -why the fuck do some men still jump around this topic?

""Oh hey. I know that the woman I fucked will carry all responsibilities, health issues, changes for 9months and has to risk her life in a painful labour that could -even today! - kill her, but hey, I just want a kid y'know""

You're not discriminated because you can't get a spawn you can ignore for 18years. You don't get a say because you don't have to go through the shit a woman has to go through!

In general: WHY THE FUCK are some men so eager to fuck with a woman's health?

""I want a say in abortion""

""I want a say if she can get her tubes tied""

""I want a say in if she's really sick or just paranoid.""

""I know rape's bad, but I don't like the idea of  devices like Rape-aXe, because I think it's still too cruel for the rapist to get his peepee hurt""(no joke! Had a guy say this in a thread about the thing)

# EDIT 2.0 PLEASE READ THIS SHIT BEFORE YOU SPAM MY INBOX FULL OF THE SAME 3 OPINIONS!

So, I had a lot of people confide in me, that the reason I have this war in the comments is because I phrased it bad. Which...yes, I see how this happened. Therefore, I made a final re-edited list of all the things I have to say. If you answer anything after that I'm not going to respond anymore. 

1.) When I said ""men SHOULD NOT have a say in a woman's abortion!"" I don't mean you can't issue your opinion/ concerns or values as the father of the child/bystander.

What I meant was: You cannot & should not be able FORCE a woman to carry your child.  
Women already have big problems with wanting their tubes tied, because ""what would your (future) bf/husband say"", or getting rejected from doctors because of sexism (for those stories, just browse the rest of this sub).  
They shouldn't also need to collect a form of ""stamp of approval"" before getting one. Y'know, like ""you must have this item to pass the gate"" style.

If you are in a relationship which is not abusive -of course, talk to your partner. Women have the final say, because they carry most of the burden physically & mentally, but getting an abortion behind your partner's back is still an asshole move.

On the opposite: You can't force a girl to get an abortion, if she doesn't want to.

2.) On the topic of child support:

I mostly agree that men should be able to walk away from it all, if they don't want to raise a child.  
There are commenters who rightfully pointed out that there are places where child support is necessary (aka woman has no access to safe abortions & generally gets screwed over more), but regarding I did this with a...okay, there are also places in the west where women have no access to safe abortions. So let's...ehm...let's rather focus on getting more legal Planned Parenthoods & co.

3.) On the topic of abortion per se:

As much as I aimed for it with such a title; this is not a place to discuss the ethics of abortion. It always boils down to your personal subjective opinion, your religion and otherwise. Please.

4.) Same goes for meandering topics like military, politics & co.  
Let's at LEAST keep it on topic.

5.) Though more rare; yes. I KNOW that transmen & nb people can get pregnant too. But please. This is not a ""woke"" debate. It was a rant I had over a guy and I'm not a person that likes to get into meander territory, because I already have a tendency to meander.  
However, same rules apply to you of course.

6.) Guys, these ""if a woman don't want to get pregnant, she just shouldn't have sex"" comments are so bad American sex-ed tapes.  
We all know that there is something that can go wrong during sex & pregnancy. Birth control can fail. Sex is not ""just"" for making kids (it's designed for it, but you also don't use a spoon to eat soup, right?), a fetus can become deformed, a woman could have been pressured into sex, doesn't have the recourses...there are a lot of reasons.

Of course, abortion is not a ""quick fix"". And most women don't use it as a ""second birth control"" to ""whore around"" -get this shit out of your system please.  
However, we can all agree that abortions won't stop when make it illegal. We'd only stop SAFE abortions. So let's do the most objectivley progressive thing and try to create better circumstances for young women to get & raise their babies, while also allowing them to terminate them. Call it a ""necessary evil""if you must.

And lastly:

7.)Thanks but...no. I don't ""hate men"".  
Yes, this was a very aggressive rant, but no, I did not ""sexist"" against anyone on purpose (cookie for the user who gets the reference).  
With ""You're not discriminated because you can't get a spawn you can ignore for 18years"" I made a reference to all the stories of men that -unintentionally or not - leave child raising mostly to the mother, or think doing the bare minimum makes them a good Dad.   
These Dads/ in general; a lot of men often don't see the other side -the side of the mother - and therefore have a bit of an watered-down perspective on pregnancy & labour.  
Stuff like ""it's just 9months"" or ""yeah, labour is bad, but have you ever got a kick into the balls?"" (not opening a pain-olympics here).

1399566712.0,Why do you think there are so few women on reddit?,"Clearly from the amount of down votes this subreddit has seen in the last few hours, there are a lot more men on reddit than women. Or people who disagree with these views of women anyway. Most comments in default subreddits also appear to be from men. Could it be that the default subreddits are catered more towards men's interests? Or because women are more hesitant to make themselves known or express their views? Or is it that women don't see such forums like reddit as attractive and would prefer to browse websites that cater towards their specific interests? 

I can see why the mods and admins would make this sub a default. Maybe they're trying to make the readership of reddit equal in terms of gender and increase visiter numbers. Maybe they just wanted to stir up some controversy. However, I do think they could have picked a better subreddit to represent women or even create a new one. I used to lurk on this subreddit to see what the women of reddit were up to, to read articles where women were having their rights abused (i.e. Feminist articles) and read a comment section that was interesting and, where there were disagreements, people were respectful of others opinions and not aggressive and rude in their rebuttals. Also the illogical 'lock to open many keys' and 'what about the men's experience in this situation' and 'victim blaming' arguments were absent. Also it was great to read about periods and feminine hygiene, knowing you wouldn't be ridiculed. 

Many women would post personal problems on here, some that were related to their gender, others not relating to their gender at all. Most responses tried to be helpful and were sensitive to the poster's feelings. I personally would not post such a problem on this subreddit anymore. The readership went from 8000 to 170,000. The chances of someone identifying me and insulting me have now increased enormously. Anonymity of opinion was one of great pulls of this subreddit.  

The new default status of this subreddit brings up some interesting issues about the gender divide of reddit, so maybe it is positive in that regard. Thoughts anyone? ",TwoXChromosomes

1605797309.0,"""Men Never Get Compliments!"" - I wish they'd be honest about what they actually want","I am so sick of Reddit threads full of men complaining about how they never, ever get compliments from anyone, the poor dears, while every single woman is treated like a pretty pretty princess every day by everyone and showered with adoration. 90% of compliments I've ever gotten came from other women. ""Your hair looks great today,"" ""I love your shoes,"" ""you have such a great sense of humor"" - all types of things I've heard from other women and told to other women. Why aren't men building each other up the same way? Why does it automatically fall on women to bolster men's self-esteem? And why don't women also compliment men if we're just ""naturals"" at this? Because these same comments directed to a man suddenly become flirtations. Signs of interest. What is supposed to be received with ""thanks, that's nice of you,"" becomes ""dude, she's into me!"" And then we're called two-faced for ""leading them on"" or sticking them in the ""friend zone."" 

And I don't believe they've never received a single compliment in their lives. That other 10% I get comes from parents and work colleagues. You want to seriously tell me your parents never complimented you a day in your life? Or do you just disregard it because all moms tell their kids they look nice or have great potential or what have you.

I am a 28 year old male. Intelligent, (recently) confident and 'self-made'.  

I started out life unwanted and poor born in a small place in the middle of nowhere.  I've been homeless, broke and destitute at points in my life.

I do not speak for the past, because I wasn't there.  I am not responsible for what my ancestors did.

I do not speak for the entire world, because I'm not everywhere.  I am in large city in North America and my experiences are, for obvious reasons, related to where I am.

I do not speak for all men, because I am just one.  And for the same reason I do not speak for all women or all people.

But what I can say is that this year :

I've had women who i thought were my friends never speak to me again when I didn't have sex with them.

I've had women hit on me all night relentlessly only to call me a 'faggot' when I refuse their advances.

I've had women put their hands down my pants and grab my junk full on without my consent.

I've seen women get unfairly promoted over more qualified people because they were more attractive.

I've seen women get angry and start fist fights when other women were looking at their boyfriend.

I've seen women cheat on their other and brag about it behind their back.

I've been accused of sleeping my way to the top.

I've had everything I've ever worked for in my entire life be dismissed in one second because I got it all from 'male privilege'.

This isn't an attack on women.  I just wanted to let you know my side.  I wanted to let you know that some of the bullshit you deal with is not because you are a woman, but because you are a human.  I wanted to let you know you are not alone.

Now, in this hypothetical bizzaro world where everything else would remain identical, that may be true. But even if that *were* true, would that be right? There are reasons not to get an abortion that aren't religious, it's a big decision, and considering somebody could go their entire lives and learn nothing about sex education, this seems like something that would help a lot of people. I'm sure probably most women are well-enough educated that they don't need any outside input to make that decision, but there are lots of ignorant people out there, male and female. Even if the majority are making rational, well-informed decisions, most *people* I know are willfully ignorant, male and female equally.

I feel like I‚Äôm getting close to 50/50 on getting she/her-ed from random people. I don‚Äôt get too many weird looks anymore. I‚Äôm getting more and more confident but I‚Äôm still pretty anxious about using public women‚Äôs restrooms. I‚Äôve used them maybe a dozen times on my own so far (at first I‚Äôd always go with a cis girlfriend for moral support). I‚Äôve never had any bad experiences like getting weird looks or someone questioning me.

Even though I‚Äôve literally had zero issues I‚Äôm still really nervous that I‚Äôll be yelled at by someone who will make a scene. I‚Äôve even had a little small talk a couple times while washing my hands.
 I‚Äôm very averse to any kinda confrontation and I‚Äôd probably run away (not easy because of my prosthetic leg) crying.

I try to be confident but I‚Äôm just constantly bracing myself for the worst. I try and tell myself that nothing bad has happened to me personally in the women‚Äôs room before, but I still can‚Äôt get myself to feel at ease.

Not really sure what I‚Äôm asking for with this post. Maybe just some words of encouragement? I‚Äôm scheduled for bottom surgery this Spring and I feel like that‚Äôll make me more confident even though no one I‚Äôm sharing the women‚Äôs room would know.

Their arguments were stating that women are too emotional and can't keep a cool head or act on instinct as well as men.  Completely sexist and biased.  

   One of my best friends is a die hard feminist to the point of being extremely aggressive.  I get annoyed because she refers to only oppression coming from men.  I believe that women perpetuate gender norms at an equal rate as men.  

   I like older women, but I've gotten to the point of lying about my age because ""men don't mature as fast as women"".  I don't mean 10 years, more like 2-5.  That is straight up sexism.  To assume something negative (or positive)of me because of my age and gender.

   Women who make a lot of money may intimidate men, but I have been laughed at and turned away from solely because of my income.  As long as I am independent, I don't understand why this is even a factor.

   I work retail/restaurants.  All fields I believe favor women.  I don't appreciate that my shoe recommendation is ignored because I'm a male manager with years of experience and she would rather be helped by the new 16 year old cashier wearing dirty flip flops. 

   I've talked with guests over the bar for hours, seen them cry talking about their struggles,  serving them cocktail after cocktail and making thoughtful recommendations for a generous $10 tip.  But that same group gives my female server $20; who did not once speak to them... just because they liked tall girls.

   I can't have long hair, cry, wear make up, heels, ask for help, or dress well, without it depreciating women's interest in me.  My point is not to say that I have it worse.  I don't believe that at all.  I believe that to fight sexual bias we need to recognize that both sides need to have their minds opened up.  
   
   I am strongly against the term ""femimist"", because I don't favor women over men I prefer ""equalist"".  A woman can save the world, or be a total dick.  Changing what's between the legs doesn't affect a personality for the better or worse,  it is as inconsequential as hair color.

1311113381.0,Is anyone else offended by all the posts in r/intactivist that compare female genital mutilation to male circumcision?,"I'll feel more sympathetic to that argument when male circumcision involves sewing up the urethra, or maybe lopping off the head altogether. Or maybe if their member is sewn to their stomach to prevent sex before marriage. Or maybe if the procedure carried serious risk of infertility.

Maybe then they can appropriately equate the two procedures.

For any men who decide to say ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù or whatever or get offended in the comment section, yes, it‚Äôs not all men. I said it. And now, this is a woman‚Äôs safe space and I don‚Äôt want to have to put the qualifier ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù after every word I use because it is implied now based on what I have said.

If you are on this subreddit to support women, it may not be you. And also, read the post before getting mad at my title. 

Men will upvote you or at worst not do anything if you simply agree with what a man said or say something super short like ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù or something that fits into their very narrow category of what is acceptable for a woman to say. 

But as soon as you actually speak your mind and have a coherent thought that may or may not go against the general patriarchal ideas of Reddit, or just going against what they said, or in anyway ruffles their feathers, you will get downvoted. Any sort of contrarian thought, even if it is completely right, will get downvoted. If you‚Äôre a man and you say the same thing or you say something very vanilla, or sound like you‚Äôre supporting men, you‚Äôll most likely get upvoted a fuck ton. 

This completely applies to real life, as well, it‚Äôs just sometimes subtler. Sometimes it‚Äôs not. 

Men teach women to be complacent, to agree, to be docile. It is truly demoralizing and dehumanizing. 

And the worst part about it is no one will stand up for you, even other women. Because they know what will happen and to most people it‚Äôs not worth it. Most people will jump on the downvote train happier than a hit of cocaine.

Amanda Todd. The girl who attempted to kill herself by drinking bleach? Because a pedophile asked her to show her her breasts when she was in 7th grade? She flashed him on a webcam and he blackmailed her by sending them to her parents unless she sent more and more.   
She was bullied so badly after her suicide attempt that she switched schools. The bullying never stopped.    
Then she hung herself.   


I remember this was all over the internet. The majority of people were calling her a stupid slut who deserved the consequences of what happened.   


A 14 year old child deserved to be harassed by a pedophile.   
A 14 year old deserved bleach down her throat. 

A 15 year old deserved suicide.   


This rhetoric was everywhere in the united states   
She had facebook pages dedicated to hating her. 

I live in Australia now. When I brought this up to my roommates they confirmed that everyone hated her here too. She deserved what happened to her, she was a whore, a slut. 

&#x200B;

All across the globe people hated a dead child for what happened to her. The man who stalked her and abused her was hated far less than the 7th grader.   


There are laws and memorials now, but if you search Amanda Todd on google images, dozens of memes pop up making fun of a sexually abused child suicide victim.   


The outrage in PC community and culture today has made wide spread rhetoric like this unacceptable. I believe today, that calling a 7th grader a slut because a pedophile convinced her to expose herself would not fly as easily.

1538934850.0,The idea that Dr. Ford should have just reported earlier is disgusting.,"I've seen this opinion a lot lately, even on here, and I honestly think it is a pretty harmful one. A lot of people seem to share it: that the timing was ""bad"" and that Dr. Ford should have just come forward when he first became a circuit judge, or maybe when he started his law career, or right after it happened, and then, maybe, it would have been okay to investigate her claim, but now its too late. I've heard people not only use this as a way to ""prove"" she was lying, but also as a way to say even if its true she's partially responsible. 

Now, I have a lot of opinions on Kavanaugh. I could talk about him committing perjury or taking a partisan stand, both thing Supreme Court justices are not supposed to do. I could talk about the way he refused an FBI investigation or how disgraceful the one we got was. I could talk about how half-assed the hearing and investigation and how it not only hurt Ford, but it only serves to injury Kavanaugh as well if he is innocent. But I'm not going to get into details about that, because in the end this isn't really about Kavanaugh. It's about all victims of rape and sexual assault - regardless of gender. 

If you really want to look at it through a lens of social responsibility, maybe reporting early is the correct thing to do morally, as it could stop the perpetrator from hurting another person. But that's completely ignoring human emotion and even human behavior. I think Dr. Ford made a pretty obvious reason for not coming forward right when it happened: she was scared. She was fifteen years old, and how can we expect a child who just went through something terrible to come forward? She didn't know if her perpetrator was going to come after her. Another big detail, was she was afraid she was going to get in trouble for being at a party and drinking. Underage drinking is another big topic with rape/sexual assault, but for now let's just skip that - the point is she had a reason for not coming forward at first, and reasons that make sense for a fifteen year old.

As I said, this isn't really just about Kavanaugh, [most sexual assaults go unreported](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system). This idea that its the survivors duty to come forward is nothing more than a way of victim blaming *and* victim shaming. There are plenty of reasons women do not come forward: some are afraid the men may retaliate against them. Others are afraid that reliving the situation will do nothing to help them, and they'll be putting themselves through more trauma for no reason. There's the shame and humiliation associated with people knowing what happened - obviously, survivors shouldn't be shamed, but that doesn't mean they're not afraid of it happening. There's also just the fact it is a traumatic experience and maybe they aren't emotionally ready to talk about it. I'm sure plenty of survivors, especially those that are young might not even realize what happened to them was wrong, or they tried to justify it in their mind into believing it was a more innocent encounter than it was. Then, comes the fact that survivors who dare speak out about powerful men have been ridiculed, humiliated, and threatened: it happened to Anita Hill. It happened to Monica Lewinsky. It happened to the countless women who accused Cosby. And yes, it is happening to Dr. Ford. These women and countless others who have stood up against their abusers should be celebrated for their bravery. But they are not. The fact people - both men and women, can see what has happened to Dr. Ford and say ""well, she should have came forward earlier"" is disgusting. It's sending the message that the survivors mental health or choices are not important. It is teaching them that they will be punished for speaking up - but they *better* speak up at the time society decides they should. 

This isn't to say there is anything wrong with wanting to empower survivors and let them know it is okay to speak up. MeToo and other movements have given many survivors the strength to talk about their experiences and feel safe doing so. It has given a lot of them support. I also think one of the best pieces of advise to anyone is that if they are assaulted or raped they should find a hospital that can handle those types of situations - they can take care of any medical needs, including checking for STDs, many places can also provide them with ways to prevent pregnancy. They can also save DNA evidence if the survivor in the future chooses to report it and seek legal action - which can be incredibly important as most sexual assaults do not have witnesses (though apparently it doesn't even matter if they do anymore, ala Kavanaugh) But in the end it should be the survivor's choice. Rape and sexual assault are not about sex: it's about dominating and taking power away from the survivor, and the survivor *needs* to be able to regain control by making choices for themselves. The answer isn't shaming survivors for not coming forward, its creating a system of support and safety so they feel like they can.

&#x200B;

TLDR: People saying sexual assault survivors should just come forward have no idea the mental and emotional trauma that it causes, and the many reasons someone does not come forward. It's not just about Kavanaugh, but this narrative of ""she should have said something sooner"" is incredibly harmful to survivors. 

Edit: I guess a better way to say this is this: how can we expect survivors and victims to come forward when they're treated like shit for doing so and we have very little support for the trauma the event and reliving it through investigations and trials can cause? Dr. Ford and others shouldn't be told they should have come forward earlier, their claims should be taken as serious now and they shouldn't be shamed for why they chose not to orginally. Maybe we should look I to why a large number of sexual assaults and rapes do NOT get reported and fix that

Edit: wow this blew up but is incredibly controversial. I want to make a couple of points clear because I seem to be repeating myself a lot:

1. No I don't think reporting or encouraging someone to report is bad. I even admitted originally that it is probably the socially responsible thing to do. What is bad is if a survivor didn't for any number of reasons when they do they are being shamed and attacked. They should not be. It's better to report something later than never, and the current narrative seems to be saying if you don't right away they never will.

2. There are plenty if reasons someone might not report a sexual assault - and not all of them are internal. None of them have anything to do with the survivor being a ""pussy"" - yes, trauma can be involved, but it doesn't mean they're sitting around crying about it. There's a lot of denial and a lot of fear. There are plenty of external issues. Look at any highly publicized sexual assault case - survivors are usually shamed at least a little bit. There's always someone trying to blame them: they should have been drinking, they shouldn't have been alone, they're lying for attention, they're ruining someone's life. These come from both the media and people in a survivors life, it's not very encouraging for someone to come forward

3. It's a pretty well known fact most rapes and sexual assaults go unreported - maybe we should ask ourselves why and work in fixing that rather than blaming survivors for it",TwoXChromosomes

I just want to say for the record, that if your partner regrets having sex with you or feels icky or gross about it afterwards, then there is a high likelihood that THEY DID NOT WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!!

Would this make you a rapist? Not necessarily.
But should this make you rethink how you approach sex and consent in the future? FUCK YES!!!

Anything less than an enthusiastic yes is a no. Silence is a no. Hesitation is a no. Someone you have to coerce into having sex with you DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU!!

From my experience, if someone regrets having sex with you, you likely did not receive enthusiastic consent. Therefore, it is totally within your partners rights to feel violated or regretful after the act is finished!

I don't know where to put this nor do I feel like I'm in the right subreddit but I need to get this out of my chest. 

I'll just put some trigger warnings because these are sensitive materials. 

-------

I suffer from depression. I have been since I was 15. Thankfully I've never had a severely low period where it threatened my life.

That is, until this January. 

I have been through both physically and emotionally abusive relationships since I started dating. 

In January, after 16 months of dating the love of my life, whom treated me like a queen and gave me a feeling of self-respect and made me thankful to get up in the morning, we split up as per his request to ""work on himself.""

It started a never-ending spiral of self-loathing, and desire to sit in bed and do nothing. I stopped eating, I redacted my acceptance to one of my dream colleges, I hardly slept, I started to cut myself, I became a heavy drinker after once hating the taste of alcohol, I haven't worked enough to even support myself, I lost interest in everything, I gave up my dog, and then actually contemplated my suicide. Now, it wasn't only because I lost the love of my life. I felt everything going wrong with my life. My friends all left me, my family took my depression and suicide as a joke when I finally opened up, it has just been a horrible experience. I also started developing health problems that I know have a close correlation to my depression & anxiety. 

I've attempted overdoses since January but have always failed mainly because I feel like I've been afraid of dying. I've been so caught up on expecting the love of my life will come back (we still talk but he's dating another girl) that I had a little hope that my life would get better. 

Last night, I felt at peace with death while walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. I told myself if I jumped, I wouldn't regret it. I took serious thought into it. 

I ended up second guessing myself the minute a couple got engaged on the bridge and asked me to take a picture of them. Oh, how I wish I could experience that but I get sick whenever I think of having sex or dating anyone else than the man who was my world. 

I decided to walk the bridge to stop the crying from the overwhelming sense of worthlessness and desire for something positive to happen in my life.

I ended up on the Brooklyn side of the bridge and walked my way to the nearest train station to get home. 

Within what should have been less than a 10 minute walk, I found myself pulled into an alley way by a guy easily over 200lbs and 6ft tall (mind you, I am less than 100lbs and not even 5ft tall) who forced himself on me. I didn‚Äôt fight nor did I even attempt to struggle. I don‚Äôt know if it was because I didn‚Äôt want to because I felt like I deserved this or if I couldn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt remember. 

All I remember is what seemed like forever (and judging from my iPhone which he surprisingly didn‚Äôt take from me), it was only about 30 minutes and I just sat there as he left and I cried. I went through an endless loop. I was sexually assaulted by my first boyfriend, went through years of therapy to find myself finally comfortable with the man of my dreams and I found myself right back in the place where I started at 16. 

It‚Äôs been 5 years. It took me 5 years to develop any sort of confidence and it got shattered in a matter of 30 minutes after I tried my best to keep myself alive after 5 months of miserable circumstance after circumstance. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt kill myself then but there really isn‚Äôt anything stopping me now but yet I‚Äôm still here. I‚Äôm upset with myself but not upset with myself enough to do something about it. This was karma for something I put someone through. 

And it‚Äôs been about 18 hours and I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I don‚Äôt want to go back to the hospital for any reason (I was roofied at a bar a few weeks ago) and I just have nobody to turn to. It‚Äôs been weeks since any of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù decided to ask me how I‚Äôm feeling when they all know that I‚Äôm going through a severe case of depression and I‚Äôm just alone.

I just needed it off my chest.

I wouldn't say I'm currently suicidal but I'm numb. Definitely numb. I don't ever want to leave my room.

I honestly don\`t know what to do as most guys shut their ears when I say stuff like this  or believe I am a feminist because I want to get more attention from girls, the only thing I want is to make the world a better place, and I believe we can achieve feminism but it is a hard fight . ""Man hating""  feels more than justified in my eyes, institutions controlled  by men and financed by men investors in men business clubs and then other men tell you its not that bad, its not all of them although a majority would rather be in a patriarchal society rather than a feminist one, then they complain that women have risen their voices a little to just get treated as other human beings and not control their ovaries.

1441032450.0,How to Deal with Trolls,"I know since joining default status this subreddit has seen a large increase in traffic, and therefore the troll population too. Well here's what you can say to a troll to get them to stop. NOTHING. DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS.  All these people are looking for is someone to interact with them, someone to validate their ego by getting offended and arguing back. Don't try to educate these people, they aren't here to learn from us, they're fishing for our attention.

So when you see a comment that is clearly inflammatory or hateful, just report it to the mods.  It's their job to take care of people who are just here to agitate.  If you're unsure of the guidelines for posting in 2X, take a look at the side bar.  

There's a report button below every comment.  You can add a message stating why you reported this person as well.

Troll me once, shame on you. Troll me twice, c'est la vie.  Troll me three times, please get out of the house and do something positive for yourself that doesn't involve shitting on someone else.



EDIT: Trolls should be ignored first and reported if what they're doing is breaking subreddit rules.  I'm speaking about abusive posts, not ""disagreeable"" ones.  For example asking someone if it was really rape in a support thread is against the rules, and should be reported to the mods.  And remember if someone says something very disagreeable but not against the rules, you still don't have to waste your time engaging them. 

And thanks to the mods for their work because if you look through almost any assault victim thread and scroll towards the bottom you can see evidence of how diligent the mods are in removing all the posts that out of line for support threads.

1528784298.0,"I feel like, as a girl, I'm not allowed to like videogames","I've always been a fan of videogames. Ever since I was a kid, because my dad bought them for himself but I ended up playing them too. And, as in any other type of media and entertainment, I like videogames because they allow me to experience stories, characters and worlds that are not my own. I like relating to the characters, seeing them grow, wanting to be like them, etc. And a huge part of that for me is playing female characters, or at least games with strong women in them. That's why I love Role Playing Games or games with female protagonists. It just lets me relate better to the characters and better enjoy the stories.

And I love the fact that in recent years that has been made possible more and more. You can choose between playing a male or a female in the new Assassin's Creed, Cyberpunk 2077 will let you create your own character, recent Battlefield and Call of Duty Games introduce female soldiers and characters. And let's not forget the perfect gem that is Transistor.

But it seems like the world doesn't like it. Almost every comment or tweet I've read about the recent Assassin's creed gameplay video is just complaining about how they're ""pandering to SJW's"" and how ""feminism is ruining the world"" just because the game \*let's you choose\* to play a female character.

And the worst was in the recent The Last Of Us Part II gameplay reveal. They show that Ellie, one of the main characters from the first game is now the protagonist of this game, and the trailer shows her all grown up, years after the events of the first game, kissing her girlfriend at some dance. She was revealed to be lesbian/bi like 5 years ago when the first game came out. So it's not like it's something new. But still, everyone is complaining how they're ""shoving LGBT propaganda down our throats"" and that the game is ruined because now you get to play as Ellie rather than Joel, like in the first game.

With these and tons of more recent controversies of women appearing in games, or female playable characters, or LGBT characters in videogames, it feels like me, as a woman, I'm simply no longer allowed to enjoy things. I'm not allowed to enjoy the stories of these women. I'm not allowed to have a character that represents me, or a character that I can relate to.

It feels really alienating. Like I'm simply not welcome in my hobby. Not to mention the blatant sexism and harrassment that I endure just because I'm a girl whenever I use the microphone, and that I'm apparently a stereotype just because I play Mercy and [D.Va](https://D.Va) in Overwatch.

I'm sorry for the stupid rant. I just needed to vent. I was super excited for the E3 conference this week but after it's finished, rather than being excited I'm just left with a bitter taste in my mouth.

He looked incredulous and said sarcastically ""Well if thats what you think feminism is, then Im a feminist."" As if that were rediculous.

I told him he actually WAS a feminist though! in our ten years together he has always championed equal rights for women and we see eye to eye on many if not all gender-related social issues.

1421931540.0,I need help. Should I try finding a boyfriend or wait?,"So a little background first. I'm a transgender woman. I've been on hormones for 7 months now and I pass pretty much all the time. I'm 26 and I've never had a boyfriend (I had a couple of girlfriends before I came out but I've always known I was into boys and only boys so they didn't go anywhere and were over quickly). I just moved 1200 miles a little under 3 months ago so I don't know many people here and I'm unemployed still.

So I've really been feeling down that at my age I've never had a boyfriend but I keep getting stuck on if now is a good time to start. I figured online dating is probably my best bet. I don't know if I should wait though because I'm out of money and am only living off of my awesome friends feeding me until I can find a job. I don't want to just have my boyfriend buy me everything because I'm really uncomfortable with that. I also don't want to say we are limit to free dates only as already my tiny town has little options especially were is super cold where I live right now (I'm about an hour south of Canada).

I'm also not very emotionally stable right now. I've been through a lot these last few months and, long story short, have tried to hang myself twice and had a week stay in a mental hospital.  So I probably shouldn't be putting myself in a vulnerable position right now. I know these are some pretty big reasons on why I should wait but it's just been eating me up inside that a woman my age had never had an actual boyfriend. I'm a pretty shy person and I often try to reason myself out of trying things like dating out of fear of getting hurt. I just don't know if I'm just making another excuse to put off something I really want because I feel is only going to harder and harder for someone like me to find someone. 

What are your thoughts? Should I go for it or should I wait and why? Also thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.

Edit: Ok, I know this was a stupid question and that I'm am idiot for even posting this. I already knew the answer before I even submitted it and I shouldn't need anybody to reinforce that dating right now is a terrible idea. It was just something that I've been stuck on for a long time and one of the things contributing to my depression. It's not something I should try doing to help me get out of depression. So I'm an idiot, we all agree.

What I want expecting was for this to be the most down voted post I've ever made. I'm clearly not Ok. I clearly mentioned I'm suicidal. I just want to know who down votes a suicidal person. Even though this is the stupidest question you've probably seen in a long time I just want to know what kind of person down votes a suicidal person. By all means, go ahead and down vote the hell out of this, just tell me why you think that's a good idea.

Edit 2: Sorry again. I didn't mean to sound like a bitch. I was just feeling extra upset this morning and clearly not thinking logically. My first edit was horrible and I'm sorry. I never should have wrote that. I clearly showed a lack of self esteem and no self respect. Thank you all for your messages and I'll try to be more put together and think about what I'm saying before posting. Sorry again you all had to see me like this. This may sound dumb but I have to add this anyways, I wasn't trying to guilt anybody into giving me free karma.

He has been in jail since. His bail was set at $25,000 and he requested to have it lowered. I waited for that call all day and I finally got it, he was denied.

I have really been working hard to get better at communicating my needs in my relationship. I always thought it was my fault for not being clear, but I just recently emailed my boyfriend and I feel totally stuck on what to do next.

[First part of what was said](http://imgur.com/qomB3UQ)

At this point I regrettably lose my cool [and this is what I say next](http://imgur.com/K6WvsA8). At the end, I'm still left feeling like my problem isn't really resolved and only a few days later he again acts like what I said I didnt like in the email.it's like watching a 2yr old throw a tantrum the way he treats me when he doesnt want to talk.

I'm just so sick of not being able to find the right way to reach him, to have things made into my fault, to have my concerns completely ignored, to be treated like the problems in this relationship are all my fault.

Before you guys ask, I am with this person because we do have so much fun together and I enjoy being with him. But when I come to him with a concern it's like a switch flips and he's a totally different assholey person. Edited to add that he will not bring up concerns he has with me until I bring something up with him. He told the counselor ""I just feel like it's a good time"" and even the racist&sexist counselor told him that's not normal. After him doing that (feels like he's steamrolling me) so many times I feel like he does it on purpose, you know?

And yes, I have been to counseling a few times but it didn't work out and I am out of money and literally out of options in my area. The sessions were so incredibly unhelpful that I feel twoX is my last resort to figure things out in this relationship, at least for myself anyway.

I am 75% sure I am going to break up with him because after 4 years of the same ignoring me, being a jerk when he doesn't want to talk instead of using his words, making me feel like everything is my fault I am just so worn out.

So WW2XD? Could someone ""grade"" my activity in the emails I linked above? I.e. what could I have done better to get him to listen, tips to avoid letting the frustration show up.

She was murdered, and many others are harmed or murdered, because men feel like women owe them something. Some feel that we owe them a date or sex simply because they‚Äôve chosen us to be the objects of their affection. Rather than building a wall we need to have a conversation about toxic masculinity, about the group of men who believe they get to play god and assert their will on women. 

- edit: Hi everyone, I‚Äôd like to refine my point a bit. Firstly, *of course I‚Äôm not blaming all men*.  I do not for a second think that this is every man‚Äôs fault. Mollie‚Äôs murder falls into a larger pattern of behavior we are seeing. Across cultures, races, religions, etc women are murdered, raped, or assaulted for refusing a man. This pattern of behavior suggests that men are socialized to believe women owe them something. They believe they‚Äôre entitled to a woman‚Äôs body or attention. Of course the man who killed her is mentally ill, healthy people don‚Äôt murder other people. However, his belief system is not uncommon. If this was an isolated incident maybe we could just blame this man and his immigrant status or his mental illness, but this is not a single incident. This is flaw in how we raise our men.

1. Changing the dialogue on sexual assault on reddit, and providing a resource and safe space for survivors 
2. Giving our site a new face, and providing some great oppurtunities for dialogue and learning
3. Not rolling over and dying when you became a default
4. Being super-civil, and this is really the big one. 

Too often, really important feminist issues get grounded by guys who dismiss it as ""SJWism"" or ""feminazis,"" or one of dozens of stone-age epithets that trashes dialogue without proving a point. It's easy to slink down to that level and come out fists flying. But what I see *consistently* from 2X is a really reasoned, well-articulated level of discourse you don't find everywhere on reddit.

In other words, I like it here. And while I know we won't always agree on everything, I think we'll find a lot to agree on -- like the value of human life (even if our definitions as to when that start differ), the value of women, and the importance of being smart, civil, and kind to each other.

Human life begins when you start breathing, biblical writers thought. It ends when you stop.

Babies do not breathe in the womb, the mother supplies oxygen to the baby..

So, what does the bible say about a baby that is in the womb?

Exodus 21:22-25 Describes a case where a man is fighting with another man and a pregnant woman jumps in... If the woman dies then the man must suffer death for murder. However, if just the baby dies, the bible describes the baby as property loss. In which, the man must pay a fine to the other man.

So, according to the bible - a baby is not viable until it is born and starts breathing...

I feel I don't understand or fit in, in the world. Like I have had many bad experiences with men. I have been sexually assaulted and rped and I had trauma because of that. Thought that there would be support online I thought thats the kinda thing that feminism is about. But I was wrong it seems that they are vicious people it suprised me that many were even supportive rpe if it's done against trans people as they think it's a cure. There is much cruelty and no empathy from them at all. 
I actually thought about looking into anti feminism perhaps this is the reason why manosphere was popular? But nope they are nothing but nasty vicious sexist people who hate women. Ironically though they seem to agree with feminists when it comes to hating people like me.

With the government looking like it's going to legalise discrimination against people like and in practice my life will be outlawed and I just am not sure if I have it in me to try and leave the country. I have started pondering life. Like thinking about if I were to die. So many people seem to spend so much time wishing for that. Both feminists and mra's.

It was like a bolt from the blue; I have never been so certain of anything in my life.

My husband of 15 years may want children, he has also been a fence sitter on this (we have both discussed our ambivalence, hence the iUD) but seems content to not have any; he has never pushed for us to have any.

He is however extremely, extremely pro-life (like angry protesting at clinics pro-life) and would leave if he ever thought I would even consider having an abortion in even the most hypothetical sense.  I personally have no issue with abortion.  

We are otherwise completely happy and have barely even fought over anything big in small over our entire relationship.  I can see an endless string of perfect days with him, child free, and I know he thinks the same.  The issue is just his religious objection to abortion; he basically could never knew or everything goes away.

I know it would be a huge violation of trust, but I am seriously considering having the abortion and never telling him.  I know that means living with the guilt of violating that trust for the rest of the relationship.

1451344536.0,PSA: Insisting that a woman do anything with her body does not make you pro-choice,"I have seen some really concerning things in this sub and this needs to be said.

Insisting that a woman keep her pregnancy for *any* reason does not make you pro-choice. Insisting that a woman abort her pregnancy for *any* reason **does not make you pro-choice**.

What makes you pro-choice is supporting the woman. You need to let the woman know that **all** of her feelings are legitimate and that the choice to either carry the pregnancy to term is *hers* and hers alone.

It is *not* okay to tell a woman, ""Just go have the abortion even though you are doubting it!""

It is *not* okay to tell a woman, ""Do *not* have that abortion, because you are killing a baby!""

It is *not* okay to tell a woman, ""You should have the abortion because **I** don't think you are in a position to have a baby mentally, financially, emotionally, or whatever else I have judged."" 

It is *not* okay to tell a woman, ""You can't have an abortion because you had sex, and it's just too bad - you're going to have to figure out how to make this pregnancy work.""

It is *not* okay to tell a woman, ""You're a bad person if you choose not to have the abortion because I do not agree with it.""

It is *not* okay to tell a woman, ""You're a bad person if you choose to have this abortion because I do not agree with it.""

There is a common thread: **Don't tell a woman what her decision is with her own body.** If you start to tell a woman what she needs to do, for any reason - because you think you know what she's feeling, you think you know what the situation will be, you think you are morally superior to her, etc - then you are not pro-choice. 

We women don't need to be told what to do with our bodies. We get enough of that every day in society. It's time to start supporting one another's *independent* choices, even if we don't personally agree with them. ",TwoXChromosomes

1413204582.0,A classmate pressed against the back of my body in school today. I don't know whether I should tell a teacher or not.,"Just starting off with some basis information, I'm still in middle school, so I don't know whether you will take this seriously or not. This offense was just a minor issue in my opinion, and when I told my friends, they brushed it off like it was nothing, so I'm starting to worry if this is regarded as appropriate school behavior or not. Because of their response, I'm not sure of whether to tell my head of year, so please give your own opinion on this matter. Thank you.

So this just happened today, in art class, with a substitute teacher. We were supposed to get our artwork from a pile of them at the back of the classroom and finish our artpieces by this lesson. The whole class rushed to the back of the class to get their own paintings, but I got to the front of the table first and started trying to find mine. I was helping some people and trying to find my own artwork at the same time, so it took a while, and eventually the whole class was crowded as a group at the back. I felt someone pushing me, so I thought it was natural since the place was a cramped place. Once I found my own artwork, I tried to turn around, only to find that this guy, who I shall remain calling ""X"", was pressing against my back with his crotch, and saying, ""Hi, pukeneoncats,"" in a sly tone. He pressed against me for 3 more seconds, then let me go. I'm a very hotheaded person, so I immediately exploded after that, pushed him away, and went back to my own easel and proceeded to to my work. I was extremely angry about the situation, and wanted to tell on him. However, even though the whole class saw the situation, they didn't comment on it. Also, when I tried to talk about it with X, he just brushed me away like it was nothing. 

I think I need to explain a bit about X as well. He's been told on multiple times by multiple people, including many of my friends. He's been told on to the head of year on following girls around after school, talking about extremely inappropriate things (and suggestive innuendo), and stalking them online. However, since these things weren't very serious and didn't concern any physical touching or anything like that, the head of year just let him off on multiple warnings. 

Around a year ago, he started taking interest in this girl, who I will call ""A"". She's an extremely magnetic and friendly person, and she's friends with almost everybody in the whole year. X was completely infatuated with A, and still is. He keeps making innuendos to her and behind her back, follows her home almost every day (since they take the same public transport), and sends her many messages online. A also has a boyfriend, and X is insanely jealous of him, always talking crap about him and just hates him. However, A doesn't mind X's blatant obsession with her, and refuses to tell the head of year about his attitude towards her, for reasons unbeknownst to me. Her friends issue many complaints to the head of year, however, because his obsession with A also affects them (since they're in close friendship with A) and they are getting annoyed of him. 

Recently, he's been taking interest in other girls as well, and one of them includes me. I started feeling bad for him last year, when I ended up being in the same advisory as he was. (Advisory is the class before school officially starts where people get to hang out and play games. I'm not sure if advisory is the word used in other places around the world, sorry.) I thought he was 'misunderstood' and felt pity for him, but he slowly became intolerable to both me and my friends from my advisory, especially when he ended up being in the same class as I was this year and started taking an interest in me. Since then, I have learnt that he is a huge jerk, always insulting and laughing at other people, even though he has the same flaws (basically a hypocrite). 

Ever since the new school year started, he's been showing more interest in me, and doing the things he normally does with A. I personally think it's because he's finally come to terms that A has a boyfriend, and wants to pursue another girl to annoy. He keeps saying ""You're pretty,"" in a creepy voice, like he's mocking me, and he keeps asking me if he could take my painting I was working on in art and hang it on his bedroom wall (for any of you wondering, it's a pop art self-portrait). He also follows me around during advisory and is always a few paces behind me before school, during interval break, at lunch and after school, if we see each other.

I'm pretty sure he's just doing all of this to annoy me, but a small part of me is just scared he's going to do something worse, especially after he pressed his body against me today. To reiterate my statement from before, should I tell the head of year my past experiences with X, added with the recent physical contact today? Sorry for making such a long post, but I really need your help. Thank you.

**EDIT:** Hi everybody! Thank you for all the comments and support you gave me. Not only have I told my parents, but I mustered enough courage to email my head of year today.

Basically, my head of year contacted me back almost immediately, and we talked one on one about the situation between X and I. He said that I was very courageous to speak up about the situation and email him about it, because he knew that it was a hard thing to do, especially surrounded by peer pressure. (So once again, thank you for helping me through this decision!) He told me that this wasn't the first time that X had gotten in trouble because of this, and he has done many of the things I had told him (my head of year) about in the email (though not all) to other girls, varying from years/grades 7-9. 

He previously had written 'reflection letters' to help him see the errors in his actions, and has been through some serious talks with the head of year, our school social workers and his own parents. However, X keeps doing the same actions over and over again, just because he doesn't see any harm or problem in doing so. After the physical attack towards me was brought to light to the head of year and our head social worker in our school, they have decided for X to see a school counsellor regularly. My head of year also said that X might not have meant to creep me, or other girls out with his sexual innuendos or suggestive way of speaking - X himself said that he saw no problem in talking to girls that way.

In the end, I'm really happy that X is going to seek some help, and hopefully he will not hurt other girls in our school, or follow them around in the future. X is a really sensitive person, so I'm not willing to talk or confront him about the situation. 

*On an unrelated note -*

Since the problem is pretty much solved now, I'm just hoping to lay low and avoid talking to him or being in a close vicinity with him unless it's mandatory. I'm pretty sure he's uneasy towards me as well, because he's been through the same situation numerous times and he always speaks badly of the girls that had called him out, but generally ignores them as well. I am in the same class and advisory as him, so it will be hard, but at least I feel safe in my school once again.

1400519620.0,Adults can be the worse (about casual sexism),"So I just graduated college this weekend, and yesterday I had a graduation party to celebrate. My mom invited a ton of her friends and our neighbors, so I had to spend a good amount of time doing my polite rounds, having pleasant conversations and telling them about my future plans, you know all that bs.

At one point I mentioned last week, in order to get my degree in English, I had to write a 20 page research paper. ""What on?"" I was asked by one woman. Ahh...I feared the worse. My topic touched on feminist topics, and this is not a polite, delightful conversation topic. ""Oh, it was on the representation of female friendships in Women's Films and how their problematic"" I replied, purposefully not mentioning my thesis being ""and how these friendships are defined by and at the whim of patriarchy.""

And that's when the casual sexism begins.

The woman laughed. ""Well, my husband has a theory that women can't really be friends with each other until their in the 30s,"" she explained. ""Before then they're just competing with each other, over jobs, over boys, you know, that kind of thing.""

""Yes, but do women compete with each other because that's how we are as women, or because we culturally teach women to treat each other that way?"" I replied. She tried to deflect answering the question directly.

A man heard us too. ""I can't speak from personal experience, since, you know,"" he says, hiding his distain for the topic behind his sunglasses but not being able to resist giving his opinion. ""But my daughter only hangs out with boys now because she says girls are too much drama.""

""That's funny,"" I said, deciding to give my anecdotal evidence as well. ""Because I have a close group of girl-friends and we've pretty much stopped hanging out with the guys that used to be in our group because THEY are too much drama."" He avoided replying as well.

I guess the reason why this whole event bothered me so much is because, well, this is why I wrote that paper in the first place. I wrote about how these movies gave barely any credit to inter-female relationships and how they can be important to a woman's life, and instead these movies focus on the obsession over woman-to-man romantic relationships that are all too often unequal in their power structure. And the reason why I thought that was important is because I didn't think it just appeared in movies, but in real life as well. And I was given proof of that right before me. I am extremely close to my girl-friends and we've helped each other so much, but here I have one woman telling me that she assumes that these friendships can't be real because we're still in our 20s and 'haven't gotten over our competitiveness,' and I have a man assuming that these girl-friends only add drama to my life, and only friendships with men would avoid that. 

I guess it also bothers me because this was at the celebration of my college graduation, meaning that in some ways I'm now in the 'adult world.' And these are the kinds of conversations I have to look forward to, apparently.

Sorry for my rant, guys, hopefully you'll relate~

(also I want to make clear that I don't think that male-to-female relationships are impossible or aren't important, or that I avoid them in my life. Personally, as of late, I don't have many close guy-friends, but this is not an active choice.

Because I'm around so much and I'm the best female golfer at my club I get quite a lot of attention. Now there's this old man that works at my club, who is very...creepy (let's call him Steve). He has been working at the club since he was 13, and now he's somewhere around 95, so he is also extremely well known. Everyone is sweet to him and admires him because he has been working at my club for so long. 

Here's the thing: he's obsessed with me having sex.

It makes me extremely uncomfortable. I haven't seen him since the summer because I've been at school and since then I've had a boyfriend for 7 months and lost my virginity to him in November. I'm almost nervous to go back to my club because I know as soon as I see Steve he's going to start lecturing me about my sexuality. Before when he would talk to me about not having sex I would just smile at him and tell him that I would ""keep my legs closed."" (his words not mine). Now I can't say that, and I don't know how I'm going to react when he talks to me about it.

On top of all of this he kisses me on the lips. I don't know how else to explain this but when he greets me he always gives me a quick peck on the lips and I hate it. He does it in public when people are watching and it makes me so uncomfortable and I can tell other people at my club are weirded out by it. This is the first time I'm addressing that fact to anyone and honestly I kind of want to cry now that I've typed it all out and written about how uncomfortable it's made me for all these years.

I know this was probably a very disorganized post but I just really needed to get all of this out there.

1413338607.0,My psychology Professor lectured on Eating Disorders today. Here's the email I spent an hour and a half writing to him afterwards.,"**Preface:** I felt like I should share this... primarily because I spent so long on it, and because I was wondering what you all think of it. Here goes nothing...

-------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Dr. So and So,

I was too nervous in class to point these things out, but I definitely wanted to add some to the conversation we had in class today about eating disorders. Feel free to use this information as you please, if you want to share it in class anonymously, even. I'm happy to answer questions, too, if you need clarifications on any of my points... (This turned out to be much longer than I anticipated, but I feel like I should be specific with my experiences so as to give you a better idea of what happens with this kind of thing).

I was diagnosed with an ED-NOS (closest to anorexia) when I was sixteen, though it had pervaded my life far before then. I have always been ""tiny,"" described as a ""twig,"" ""peanut,"" ""stick,"" or whatever other thing you can attribute to small. I was always picky with my food as a child. I had to be force-fed nutritional shakes when I was as little as seven years old, because I would not eat if I didn't feel like it. At 11, I was diagnosed with depression and put on Zoloft. I didn't begin menstruating until I was 14, which was still considered normal, but a little on the later side.

My menstruation quickly vanished after a month or two, because my eating was still an issue. I didn't think much of it, because it is well known that it can take up to a year or two for a woman's cycle to become regular. I always pushed my food around, spat it out if it didn't taste good enough, and refused to eat if the food wasn't what I wanted to eat for supper. This behavior was all normal for me, and my mother thought (like so many people do) that if I was hungry enough, I'd eat.

I didn't. I think this is very important to note, because a lot of people believe that hunger will eventually overcome and force a person to eat. But it didn't, I was completely aversive to food. It, in so many cases, was disgusting. I'd rather starve than eat. Eventually, the stomach shrinks, because you're not feeding it. You get used to starving. This is one of the hardest parts of rehabilitation-- ""regrowing"" your stomach. It's actually painful, and nauseating, which is why so many girls can't do it by themselves (besides the other mental implications of the disorder). And, often, you are also constipated.

The constipation comes from your body trying to hold onto any food that it gets, to consume nutrients from dry nuggets that build up in your digestive tract. It's not pleasant in the least. I wouldn't take bowel movements for a week, sometimes. This also hurt, when I was trying to reverse the effects of my disorder. 

Throughout high school, I suffered severe bouts of depression, which exacerbated my bad eating habits, lowering my appetite (which is actually, as has been stated in class, a symptom of depression), and convincing me that if I was depressed I wasn't good enough to eat. It was a form of passive suicide, as the girl in the video mentioned she was attempting as well.

Passive suicide and active suicide are things I don't believe we've touched on in this class, but I think they are very important things to cover, because crossing a busy street as slowly as you can, or starving yourself, is just as dangerous as overdosing on pills or cutting your wrists. It just takes longer.

I wanted to touch on other physical symptoms of the disorder as well. Yes, cosmetically, you become gross, your hair becomes brittle and your mouth always stinks (acid reflux is attributed to Anorexia... I can't find any papers on this at the moment but was told this by a former nutritionist and experienced it first hand). For me, the worst part was blacking out. My peripheral vision was severely impacted by not eating, turning black-- tunnel vision sometimes, other times, my entire eyesight just wiping out. I would go blind for several seconds because I wasn't eating. Dizziness played into this, as well.

I'd push through it due to having more important things to do, though. I still wouldn't eat, because I felt no need to and didn't care to. So while anorexia can be primarily associated with wanting to lose weight, and making sure that you do, there are other factors that contribute to making sure you don't eat-- a learned aversion, stomach shrinking, etc.

Another main point that I wanted to touch on was body dysmorphic disorder. See the definition here: http://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/other-related-conditions/body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd

Body dysmorphic disorder is often comorbid with anorexia or bulimia. In my case, it was not (which is perhaps why I was considered NOS and not specifically linked to any disorder). I did, however, think that I was on the skinny side of normal before I went to get help. I didn't realize how bad being 5'5"", 89 lbs. was until I saw a picture of myself that my sister had taken-- I literally looked like skin and bones. I then knew that it was abnormal, how skinny I was, but still didn't see it in the mirror.

I think there is a lot of work to be done in this field, because even though I was able to recover to where I am now (105 lbs, 5'5""-- a little under normal, but much better than where I was at) my experiences with it were horrible. The disorder's physical effects are frightening, and the way people handle it are even worse. The first time I went in to a nutritionist, she didn't not treat me like I had been treated in counseling sessions for depression. She told me that if I continued as I was, I would die. As I pointed out before, I had always been ""twiggy,"" but the nutritionist in question (as well as others I have encountered) only used scare tactics to try to make her patients better. It's awful. And I know I'm not the only one, because I know at least two other girls who have encountered the ""if you don't get better you're going to die"" statement, warranted or not.

I wanted to point out, that as you said toward the beginning of the semester, it is appropriate to distinguish the person from the disorder when speaking about these things. I'm not sure if it was one of my classmates who said it, or if it was in the powerpoint or something, but I felt the need to emphasize this: a person suffers from anorexia, they are not anorexic. I think that if we are against calling a person with bipolar disorder ""bipolar"" then we should apply the same courtesy to people with various eating disorders. If someone wants to use it as an adjective, I think the phrase ""anorectic"" is a little better, but my point remains.

Also, I think this question was misinterpreted, but you can be overweight and suffer from an eating disorder. You should be losing weight, I believe, to qualify for a diagnosis (if it isn't just severely affecting your lifestyle), but you can be in a higher weight range to begin with. See this link:
http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/132/4/e1026.short

I hope it wasn't too out of line for me to share what has been going through my head since the beginning of the lecture. I feel much better having addressed it, and I hope that what I said has some value to what will be taught in class or in future classes.

Thank you,

Maybe it's because I'm young, maybe it's because I'm naive, but I really do like to think that blatant sexism is a thing of the past. 

I almost went home crying last night. I'm signed up for a basketball class for the summer to stay enrolled in university. I've played traveling team basketball since I was 9. I've played sports since I was 4. I played varsity ball in high school. I've won county, state, and national championships. Needless to say, I am *not* unfamiliar with the game.

I'm not sure what I was expecting with this class. I had a hunch that I would be the only girl, but that doesn't bother me. I even laughed it off because I knew we would only be using men's regulation size basketballs, no women's to use at all.

But it crosses the line for me when I am left out. There are 11 people signed up for the class. Scrimmaging is 5v5. Guess who hasn't gotten picked for a team two days in a row? Me, the girl. There are three kids in this class that have never even picked up a basketball before. Hell, one of the kids couldn't hit the bleachers with the ball if he tried. But he gets picked. The kid who can't dribble -- he gets picked. The kid who outright admitted he's never played a game of basketball in his life -- yeah, he gets picked too. But me, the girl, with over a decade of experience and playing time, oh no. 

I try not to get offended very easily, but it was obvious that the only reason I wasn't picked to play with them is because I have a vagina. I try to pretend that sexism doesn't exist, we're all people, we shouldn't see each other in terms of gender, or sex, or color, or what-have-you, but this was just too obvious. Too in my face. Sorry, I'm venting. It really hurt my feelings. It doesn't matter that I have put sweat, blood, tears, and *years* of my time playing this game, no, I have a vagina. Girls don't play sports. She can't play with us.

To stand up for womankind, and before you all get any more misinformation:

If a woman is freshly showered and healthy and the pH balance down below is normal, a vagina won't smell ""fishy""!

If a girl has an infection, that's one thing. But musty/sex smell does not equal fishy!!!

It will only be even remotely ""fishy"" if the pH is off or there's an infection. In which case, you could be kind and go with the girl to the gyno rather than telling everyone that she has a ""fishy"" vagina. It is TEMPORARY, guys. No girls have a permanently smelly vagina, just like men don't have permanently sweaty balls.

A man's cock&balls (unshowered and sweaty) can smell unsavory (to put it lightly) but we there aren't any sexist threads to that end.

Your comment (and this whole thread) makes me sick.

edit: thanks for all the comments participating in this discussion! even if I don't agree, it helps me understand all the perspectives. Also, in real life I am rather a ""people pleaser"" and  avoid taking a strong stance, so it's hard to take all the bullying posts. trust me from personal experience: under a different username, avoiding conflict, and getting naked on gonewild and being asked into personal chats = much ""friendlier"" reception on reddit. wasn't worth it, though.

1323204416.0,"Not sure how to take this... the whole feminism thing has kinda gone too far, in my opinion.","So I'm a 19 year old girl, married for 4 months, and currently do not have a paying job. My husband owns his own business and does quite well, so therefore I have that choice to stay home for now or just take it easy. I started out working at a house cleaning business (I really like cleaning!), but found some of the clients were too rude for my liking. So I haven't been working for about 3 months.

Anyways, both me and my husband enjoy this set-up. He works, brings in the money, stuff like that. I stay home, clean the house, make him a hot meal at the end of the day, and so on. It goes back and forth too, we both make decisions about the business and we also both do chores around home.

So the other day I was at an early family gathering. Considering I got married at the youngest age in my family for awhile, I got lots of attention at this gathering. My family can get a little heated about certain issues, but his one took me by surprise. I was talking with my second cousin (she's 27) and my aunt (she's 36 or so...) about what my plans are for the coming year and how things have been going so far. When I mentioned how I enjoyed being able to take care of the home and my husband, and how I'd like to stay at home with our future kids, my aunt said, ""Oh, you're the perfect little house wife!"". Immediately, my cousin just bit her head off, saying how that wasn't necessary and how I could work if I wanted and that I wasn't just some dish washer, I could get a job. 

The long and the short of it is that my cousin thought I should be insulted because my aunt said I was a good house wife. But.... I *am* a house wife. I've seen this before too. It's like we assume that if a woman wants to be in the traditional role of a wife, she's either been pushed into it or been brainwashed somehow. Am I the only one who thinks like this?

1407886668.0,I almost went over to a rapists apartment for dinner/movie date,"So I met what seemed to be an awersome guy on OK cupid.  We shared all the same interests and he seemed to actually have his shit together pretty decently.  Now I'm not stupid enough to just go over to some random guys apartment - my 1st dates are always in public locations.

We went out for coffee(not Starbucks but this amazing place he knew about) and everything seemed perfect.  We probably spent 4+ hours of the afternoon and would have gone to dinner that day together if I didn't have plans with my sister already.  He kissed me when we said good by and I was SOO excited to see him again.  When he txted me that night I was thrilled.  We set up a date that weekend for me to go over to his apartment Saturday for dinner.  He was saying he wanted to try this new recipe (a guy that cooks!?) and we'd watch Netflix.

So this is where it starts to get interesting.  I've always used Spokeo to check people out online for a few years now - found out my last guy was cheating with it actually.  I had looked this guy up before we ever went on the 1st date and nothing came up at all.  For some reason though I saw an ad while I was on OKC for a different site - Persopo.  Went to go check him out there and HOLY SHIT I'm glad I did.  The guy was convicted and served a 5 year sentence for ""sexual assault"" and ""sexual battery"".  This is a guy that told me he'd never been arrested.

At first I didn't want to believe it.  There just seemed NO WAY this could be the right guy.  These public record sites have wrong info all the time.  But I took the course number and looked up else where on the county he used to live in and sure enough it was there....

So basically she is a fairly popular, musical theatre, Starbucks kind of girl, and insanely pretty, even though she doubts me when I tell her that. But anyways, she has some pretty bad.. Habits? For lack of a better word. She is bulimic, and anorexic, but some how maintains a healthy, sexy weight. But she also cuts and burns her wrists, legs, and breasts. I'm the only one that she has ever told, and I try to relate with her as best as I can, and spend as much time talking to her and hugging her through it, so she's never tempted to purge or self harm. However, I'm really running out of things to tell her. It doesn't seem like she's going to stop anytime soon, and I try to tell her that she's strong and to just fight it, but it's impossible for her it seems. I tell her that she's beautiful everyday, and that she has no reason to do this to herself, but she always tells me she just can't stop, and she's scared of gaining weight so she purges. And then to keep her mind off of how hungry she is, she burns and cuts her skin until the pain is unbearable and she has no choice but to think about how much her arms and legs hurt. She hates it when I tell her to stop, because it's not something new to her, she knows she should stop, but simply cannot.

To top it all off, she recently told my best friend ( her boyfriend ) what she does to herself, and why. He told her how disgusted he was with her, and that their entire relationship is now a disappointment to him, and that if he didn't love her so much, he would leave her. That sent her spiraling out of control, and I find myself now talking to her all night until 5am, or having someone knock on my door at midnight to stay the night, and all she does is cry her self to sleep in my arms. I feel like I've told her everything I can, and I've even googled some things that I find fitting to tell her, and this sub reddit seems like a perfect place to get some new POVs and things to reassure her with.

I love her to death, and it almost brings me to tears to see my friend of 15 years debilitating before my eyes. So I need someone to help me, just anyone who has an opinion, I would greatly appreciate.

>In an article she wrote at the time, she claimed support the right of individuals to identify as they choose, but said that transsexuals ""surgically mutilate their own bodies"" and that ""feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism."" 

>She concluded the article with one of her most famous quotes: ""If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?"" This quote and others like it from her are used to this very day by trans-exterminationist radical feminists to demonize trans people and justify their discrimination.

>In her 1983 book Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions, Steinem wrote: ""[T]ranssexuals are paying an extreme tribute to the power of sex roles. In order to set their real human personalities free, they surgically mutilate their own bodies: anything to win from this biased society ‚Äî where minor differences or hormones and genitals are supposed to dictate total lives and personalities ‚Äî the right to be who they individually are as human beings.""

I was trying to help OP and instead was critisized and made to feel insecure about my life choices. First off, downvotes are for comments which do not add to the discussion, but it's not really about that. 

I should be allowed to look silly and still feel accepted here. I am a carefree and happy person, and I like to give advice to other women here on 2x. 

You know what? I stand up for you all, all over reddit. I call people out for sexist bullshit and I give advice to people who need it. I've been on reddit since 2005, under many different user names, and I think I've actually helped some people. 

I'm not one to get butthurt on the internet, but I did not see this coming. My feelings are now hurt, thanks guys, and aufweidersein.

1286253160.0,This is not an Agony Aunt subreddit or a translator or r/relationship_advice. We are 2XC and that is something completely different.,"This subreddit is about women, and all aspects of our life, frivolous, serious, and anywhere in between. Sometimes, advice is required and asked for. Sometimes this advice is relevant to what this subreddit is about. Sometimes it is not.

An advice post that I think is relevant: [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dmdtx/i_need_some_advice_to_help_my_balding_mother/). A guy is posting, requesting help for his mother's health.

An advice post that I don't think is relevant: [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dmmsa/lady_friend_wants_some_chase_and_excitement/) where a guy is coming to us, basically asking for us to translate how his current squeeze is acting.

I will say that I think the responses in that second post are great, telling him to go to r/relationship\_advice or r/sex but over the last few months, as 2XC becomes more well known, it seems there have been a LOT of posts asking for similar advice *without* that response. It worries me because I don't want this subreddit to turn into r/agony\_aunt or r/girl\_translator.

Of course, this is all just what I've been observing and how I feel about it. What about you guys? Mods, do you agree? If so, do you think that we could have a note to that effect in the sidebar?

1412526167.0,My small rant on little girl cheerleaders,"I went to a friend's son's soccer game yesterday.  It was at a huge complex with tons on fields.  There were also little kids football games going on.  I noticed each football team had their own cheerleaders,  all little girls from age 4-10. They did no gymnastics,  just cheering.

i was super athletic as a kid. I played boys hockey.  It bothers me to no end that little girls are taught to cheer for the boys instead of being athletes themselves.  This was in a city where women overwhelmingly are stay at home. If it's rare here for women to go to college. I think those things go hand in hand.  

I mentioned it to my friend how seeing little girls as  cheerleaders made my son crawl and she couldn't ""get"" my problem with it. Am i alone on this?  What do others think of little girls being cheerleaders instead of the ones participating in the sports? 

Eta..i do realize for older kids there is a lot of gymnastic skill involved,  but they are not classified as a sport for title 9 so it cannot lead to an athletic scholarship. ",TwoXChromosomes

Having this subreddit made default has probably given the community no end of grief, with all of the grief comments posted on even the nicest of stories, but that also helps to drag that grief out of the shadows and into the public eye.

Like I said, I know women go through some crap, but it wasn't something I really saw/noticed day in and day out. But now, whenever I open Reddit, I'm being reminded several times a day what a woman has to go through, or what they risk going through every time they leave the house. Which I'm grateful, because it just reiterates to me how important it is to do something, anything, in order to work to change these out dated perceptions of the ""woman's place"". It reinforces my desire to raise my son to treat women with the respect that all human beings deserve, and to raise my daughter to know and understand that she doesn't need to seek approval from anyone but herself.

So thank you for making this a default. I'm a fairly open minded and accepting person, and it's even made me realize some of the things I can do to improve. I can only hope that it does the same for others.",TwoXChromosomes

So basically back when the World Cup was going on and Spain beat Costa Rica 7-0, I sent my friend a screenshot of the stats of that game since it was a complete domination, with Costa Rica having 0 shots, only 18% possession, etc., and my friend responded by saying:

Friend: ""Yeah that's what we call a Danish rape and rob""

Me: ""what?""

Friend: ""Viking raids. They raped, robbed, and burned the villages and decimated everything. That's what happened here""

Me: ""you think rape is a joke or something?""

Friend: ""No, I don't. That's just the first thing that came to my mind, no jokes intended. Bad choice of words looking at it, I apologize""

I proceeded to not say anything at all in response and just ghosted them forever basically.

The main things that I find funny about this are:

\-How he said ""No, I don't"" in response to being asked if he thought rape was a joke, which if he didn't think it was a joke, then he wouldn't have said the thing that he said

\-I love how he said ""That's just the first thing that came to my mind"". Like dude, that literally makes it 500x fucking worse lmao. If someone shows you sports stats, and the VERY FIRST THING that comes to your mind is a rape joke, then there's a problem there lol

\-The part where he said ""No jokes intended"". It's like, so what, your mouth just decided to act on its own separately from your brain or what? Your mouth is just out here doing whatever tf it wants to do out of your control?

background:I live in one of the third-world countries- harassment is a common. I just don't have the will to fight with every guy that comes along.

I've personally been bothered by the fact that Elsa and Anna from Frozen look identical ever since the movie came out. I never gave it much thought and assumed I was just lacking attention to detail. Eventually it drove me nuts enough to do a little research and I came across this blog. 

The writer describes something called ""same face syndrome"" as well as goes through Disney's animation evolution that leads up to Elsa and Anna's character design. However, the student stops writing, going only as far as her ""expertise"" allowed, steering clear from the sensitive topic of women and beauty which leaves the reader to ponder what suggestions Disney may be subtly  making to society.

1399995491.0,Do you Care to Stand up for Women's right to Body Hair and the inherent Femininity/Womanliness that it Embodies?,"(Kind responses only please) EDIT: this doesn't mean I only want to hear people that agree with me, just be nice about it if you don't, because this issue is about body shame and I would like a thread of comments that don't contribute to more shame.

I am a woman who loves and leaves all my body hair, but then I am not too hairy. I am not concerned about myself, but rather the many woman who feel they have to remove it to be accepted. I am interested in hearing from both women who like and keep hair, but also from woman who may love to remove it, but are still able to stand up for our rights to be ourselves and who can speak positively about their bodies even when they prefer another option, in the effort to support everyone. 

As hair restrictions become more intense, people have become less comfortable with all their body hair. When I was in High School in the 1990's, bikini line waxing wasn't a thing, and we all let it hang out, just like our mother's and aunties had done. Do we need to exercise our rights to keep them? Is this a use it or loose it situation? I let my few hairs that stick outside my bikini line (like 30 of them), stick out because I care so much about standing up for this right. Even when I waxed bellow, I made sure to let some hairs stay from my mons so that on my special trip to Hawaii with my husband, I could proudly brandish my bush flag. 

I do this because I know there are women hairier than I and I want to say - this hair is OK. You are OK. I believe it is time for a hair revolution, not to stop waxing, but rather to say WE CA DO WHATEVER THE F WE WANT TO and WE ARE STILL WOMANLY AND BEAUTIFUL because HAIR IS NATURAL ON WOMEN AND THUS IT IS INHERANTLY FEMININE. 

Is there anyone who does what I do, wears their hair like a badge of honor, and are there more of you willing and brave enough to do it sometimes?

Who is confident enough to do it with pride?

Is there anyone like me who feels their body hair is soft and beautiful and sexy and prefers it?

Are their any hardcore waxers who are willing to speak only positively about hair, even on their own body, or in the privacy of the bedroom with a lover, so that body love is spread rather than body hate.

Again, this isn't anti waxing or shaving, it is just pro freedom of choice.

Last year I saw a young girl with hair that grew from her temples onto her cheeks and towards her chin. It wasn't like beard hair, but rather more like soft head hair that extended way down her face. I thought she was exquisitely beautiful and that her hair was super fitting. She kept it trimmed short, but not shaved off. I wanted to tell her I thought she was gorgeous, but hesitated because I didn't want to put her on the spot. Have you had experiences like this and should I have said something to promote positivity?

Am I alone in my interest in creating a world in which our natural bodies are accepted and cherished as beautiful, even while we maintain our rights to choose to do whatever we like to them?

Second of all, shaving my head has made me realize there is something terribly wrong with our society. 

(Generalizing is of course bad so I'll have to mention that I'm currently in the US, studying at a small liberal arts college in the outskirts of Chicago and thus all my ideas are based on this small society)

I finally feel less sexualized, I feel like people are finally looking at me and they see a person with ideas, rather than a piece of meat that would eventually end up in their bed. I'm not sure if there is something wrong with me and I'm just boring and have nothing to give to the people around me or if there is actually a problem with the way people tend to perceive females. 

Since I shaved my head no male has attempted hitting on me and it feels extremely liberating - no cheap pick-up lines, no ""netflix and chill"" invitations, nothing. And it feels great. I'm not sure if that's because they assume I am a lesbian or if they just finally perceive me as a human.

My question is... is it just me or is there actually something terribly wrong with the way society perceives women?

Let's talk about highly economically developed countries where people are supposed to be open-minded).

i feel really terrible about it, and i realized lately that maybe i'm really lonely deep down, even though i have great friends and go to a great college. there's this void that i didn't realize i had, and i don't know why i have it or what can fill that void. but i feel like a slut, which is awful and fucked up that i think that bc i slept with an asshole that i just met and i don't think i should think of myself as a slut just for wanting to be sexually liberated but after this instance i do. i really regret it and i feel like this is a low point for me but i don't know what to do with this overwhelming feeling of loneliness. i don't even want a serious committed relationship, so i have no idea where this is coming from.

in addition, every time i hook up with a guy, i always think about and wish it was this particular guy i hooked up twice with, even though 1) the age difference is really big//he lives in a different city and 2) he's probably not even interested in me anymore or doesn't even value me as anything more than some girl who's 8 years younger and hooked up with twice

i don't know, i guess i'm just posting in hopes that someone relates or feels the way i do 

EDIT: the point that there wasn't enough information to warrant me thinking he was an asshole was brought up, so somewhere in the comments I have more detail. I had the intuition that there was something not quite exactly nice about him, but if you disagree that's fine too. Also, thank you for taking the time to read as well!

edit2: okay well the thread was hidden but here is more information for those who want it to make a more accurate judgement --

If you want other information, I guess I should've listened to my intuition when he texted me (as we were planning to hang out): ""This better be worth it"". I replied, ""And what if it's not?"" and he said, ""Then I'd waste a ton of gas"". I was like, ""well if you think you'd waste a ton of gas/want more than to hook up and smoke weed then maybe you should play it safe and not come"". He ended up coming, obviously but when we were fooling around, he asked for head which I did, because I do like it/the response it gets but he started pushing my head faster even though I was gagging and it was clearly uncomfortable for me. He came after like 45 seconds and went to put another condom on because I guess he was embarrassed for finishing early but then he said, ""I can't get hard with a condom on"" and implied sex without condoms. At that point I was like noooooooo way. But I don't know, those things to me make me think someone is kind of an ass but if you don't think so, that's okay too. I just didn't particularly enjoy it
I say he's sleazy, because even in conversation and etc I realized afterwards he, and his personality, was just like the type of guy that I would avoid in general--sleazy and looking for cheap fucks. I'm not saying I'm above that, clearly I was just looking to hook up too, but I guess I expected better behavior/more intelligence from guys in general. Which is my fault too.
But you're right, I think because of my previous mostly positive experiences with hook ups (all of them were with older guys who were more my type) I expected this to be a positive experience and the lousy sex was definitely something I didn't think would happen. At the same time, I don't think lousy sex is the end of the world. I realized something bigger was happening here, the fact that I did this signaled to me that I was at a pretty low point in how I was feeling, so no I'm not whining about some lousy sex.",TwoXChromosomes

I've recently come out to her as mtf trans, while she's fully supportive she has said that she doesn't think it's ever going to be possible for her to treat me that way. She's apologised and said she doesn't want to feel that way because she loves me, intellectually she's supportive but she feels like her body is telling her that crossing that line might let a 'fox into the henhouse'

She explained that the experience of coming into puberty as a girl is traumatic, suddenly strange men are constantly circling and leering looking for an opportunity to take advantage of her. She feels like her womanhood has been defined by this lifelong experience of constant alertness and fear of predators. She doesn't feel like someone who hasn't gone through that can understand what being a woman really feels like, and I am sympathetic to that. I didn't have to go through that, and these are personality shaping life experiences. I don't have any right to, challenge that because from her perspective it's a predator asking to take shelter among prey.

 It does make me very sad, but I do understand her perspective. She doesn't let it impact how she treats me, so I guess I'm asking if this is reasonable?

I'm from the UK and this completely baffles me. Completely.

I am on the pill (Cilest if anyone's bothered) and have previously been on the implant (implanon). NEVER have I had to pay for it. Even the morning after pill is free prescription from the doctors (¬£25 if you buy from pharmacy). 

I have read quite a few posts today about people having issues with insurance covering their contraceptive fittings (to the tune of nearly $1000) and women having to go through embarrassing and traumatic pelvic exams before being considered for the pill!

Let me just say, in the UK most GP's surgeries will give you a prescription for any contraceptive pill FREE OF CHARGE with just a simple blood pressure test and a few questions about past medical history. Easy peasy. 

Family planning clinics will let you have a short consultation about other forms of contraception (injection, implant, coil) and then book you in for a fitting. Which I think is free for under 25's and probably still free over that age from hospital clinics. 

It's no wonder there are so many unplanned pregnancies occuring, the whole experience appears complicated and somewhat traumatic for people overseas.

Even condoms are free from the docs and sexual health clinics.

This is just a rant really, but I'm hoping to become a sexual health nurse and fertility consultant and this whole idea just makes me angry.

If anyone has any information or any of my comments are misinformed please let me know. 

Everyone should have the right to FREE safe sex and contraception.

EDIT: on the subject of abortion. It is also free and easy and you can recieve the abortion tablets with only one appointment at an abortion clinic (subject to a consultation and viability).

Snopes literally has multiple pages debunking this.

Second, I believe y'all when you say some creep followed you around the store or your Uber driver wouldn't let you out of the car. I've had similar experiences and it sucks and it's terrifying, but those men are much more likely planning sexual violence for their own sick personal ends rather than selling us to international human smuggling rings. My evidence for this is that while there are lots of testimonials online from women who suffered creepy behavior, there are essentially none from first world women who were actually trafficked. Testimonials from former traffickers or members of law enforcement who have busted organizations whose supposed MO is snatching first world women from public places are also similarly lacking.

Third, it's pretty hard to secretly smuggle unwilling humans on a large enough scale to be profitable. Drugs/guns/diamonds/antiquities are all much easier, because they don't need to breathe, drink, eat, or go to the bathroom and also don't try to escape or have friends or family who might try to come looking for them. Few criminal organizations can actually do this and the ones that can aren't going to risk blowing the whole operation by snatching someone who probably has a cell phone, may be on camera, and is the exact type of person whose disappearance tends to go viral.

I'm a little confused why society is so invested in having first world women believe this urban legend and why so many of us are invested in believing it ourselves. Maybe it's easier to blame the sexual mistreatment of women on an unnamed scary organization rather than millions individually awful but completely unconnected men in patriarchal societies. Maybe it's easier to make sexual violence appear to be something driven by the demands of 'foreigners' rather than endemic in our own countries. Maybe there's a political movement that benefits from first world women believing that we're at significant risk of being attacked by the aforementioned 'foreigners'. Maybe it's all of the above and more.",TwoXChromosomes
1628342848.0,Terfs and MRAs have a new grift: Surrogate motherhood is bad,"This is a new narrative I've seen being pushed over the past couple days and I've already seen LGBT people, progressives, and the otherwise well intentioned fall for it. While they fairly criticize the commercialization of it, they then pivot toward demonizing gay men for coercing cis women into giving them their bodies. They specifically mention altruistic surrogacy as an evil which doesn't actually exist as every surrogate has been, in some way, coerced by a man. While I've mostly seen terfy types pushing this narrative there are, of course, plenty of MRAs and open homophobes that have pushed a similar narrative as well. In either case, there is an emphasis on a woman's lack of agency in making decisions about her body. Can a woman be coerced into having a baby she doesn't want? Sure. Can a woman be coerced into having an abortion she doesn't want? Also yes. A potential surrogate should be given the necessary resources to understand and handle a surrogate pregnancy, but to declare them bad outright because \*men\* is actively, literally misogyny. You cannot tell a woman what she can and can't do with her body. Furthermore, while this narrative primarily concerns cis women it also extends to trans and non-binary surrogates as well.

   We are both students in college, and I drove up to visit. At around 8 pm we each ate 2 grams of shrooms and smoked mj pretty steadily that whole night. We giggled at Netflix and hung out watching lights dance on the ceiling. 
At midnight we became intimate and we had the most intense emotional connection, something I had never felt before. We reached a certain point where I cried from how happy and how much love I felt in that moment, it had become overwhelming. He was right there along with me. 
It was an evening that made me more happy in a while.

1436280337.0,What Disney never told me about being pretty,"A couple of days ago a post was made to here called ""What it's like to live as an ugly girl"", it was incredible and I recommend everyone reads it, it brought me to tears. However one comment on there really effected me; somebody said that ""winning the genetic lottery"" made life so much easier. They are very wrong. I couldn't get it out of my head and wanted to share my experience as a pretty girl, sorry it's so long.

I was a gorgeous child; blonde hair, cheeky green eyes and a thousand watt smile. I could get every person wrapped around my little finger in seconds. Everyone always told me that I was going to grow up to be a beautiful woman. I was so excited for it, in all the films the beautiful girls get people adoring them, showering them in praise and affection, they marry the princes and live in a castle. It sounded perfect. 

When I hit puberty however I became a plain jane; my hair darkened to a mousy brown and thinned out and I gained enough weight to obscure my facial features. I kept my thousand watt smile though. I'd spend all day smiling and everyone I smiled at smiled back, I spread happiness and in return was happy for it. I was treated my best when I was plain.

At 16 I went to college (it's a different thing in England) and, because I had to walk a couple of miles to and from the station and started eating healthier, I lost a lot of weight. Suddenly I was gorgeous; I had a little weight, big boobs, mesmerizing facial features and I'd even dyed my hair back to blonde. I also felt so much healthier, my depression was easier to control and I had so much energy. 

Despite feeling better in myself I noticed the way people treated me changed. No one that I wanted to be friends with would talk to me, only other pretty people would and these people were not the type you'd want to be friends with. I felt incredibly isolated, I had no one to have a deep, real friendship with for months. Eventually my chemistry partner asked me to hang out with his friends and I nearly cried from happiness. They were so much nicer to me, my flaws weren't constantly picked on and the conversation didn't revolve around clothes, boys and alcohol. But even then they were distant from me, I tried speaking to the few people I was getting close to and they said it was because they were intimidated by me or thought I was shallow and bitchy because of how I look. 

Six months in and I still didn't have anyone that I felt close to, the girls only wanted to know how I got so pretty and the guys only wanted to get in my pants. I couldn't work out what I was doing wrong, was it the jokes I made, was it the interests I had. It was torture, I just wanted to be liked for my personality but no one could see past my looks. The worst part was that when I smiled at people in the street I didn't get nearly as many smiles back, now I got predatory looks and hatred.

Things just got worse; my mother had a stress related mental breakdown. I was devistaed but had no one to talk to. I ended up breaking down in psychology class and running out of the classroom crying. As I was sat in a corner of the corridor crying people just walked past and ignored me, some commented ""what could she have to cry about"", ""stupid pretty girl always making drama"", ""I bet she just ran out of mascara"". Nobody thought I could have real problems if I was pretty.

In all of this I turned to the one person that had always been nice to me, a guy I shall name Jerry. Jerry had always made it obvious that he was mostly nice to me because he was interested, he wasn't the best looking guy, kind of shy and geeky but he was sweet, so I thought. Eventually Jerry and I started dating, when I started dating him people started being nicer to me, apparently I couldn't be that bad if I was willing to date a guy that was obviously punching above his weight. They had no idea what was going on when we were alone; Jerry would be incredibly controlling, he would always tell me that he was just doing it because I was so pretty, he's also yell when I did things he didn't like. Then one night at a party he raped me, I was to scared to tell anyone. He abused me for 10 months and every time he did he'd tell me that I was just so beautiful that he couldn't keep his hands off, if I didn't want this I should do something to be uglier. After 8 I broke down and told one of the people I thought I was friends with, she slapped me in the face. She said to me ""You pretty girls always make a fuss, I bet you're just making it up for attention"". 

After this I just couldn't take it anymore and I attempted suicide. I was put on anti depressants and given therapy however every day I wanted to ruin the face that caused everything. The real help was my first actual friend in a year and a half; Josh (not real name) was new in town and I befriended him, we got on really well and I relied on him so much. He was my best friend; I cried in his arms, I had inside jokes with him and spent all the time I could talking to him. However his other friends didn't like me, they told me that I was to pretty to be acting like this around him, that it wasn't fair to him. This left a rift between us which just grew bigger and bigger. My looks ruined something else.

I'm doing a lot better now, I have friends and a wonderful boyfriend. But being beautiful still holds me back; I don't like going outside anymore, I'm incredibly wary of people and I still hate my pretty face. I don't go clubbing though, I've had to many guys and girls grab me, kiss me, follow me, yell things at me. It's horrible and scary, one drunk girl even slapped me because all pretty girls deserve to be taken down a peg.

What disney never told me about being pretty is that it makes you miserable. I can't have interests outside of the stereotype without being called names and excluded. I can't walk down a street without having horrible, degrading things yelled at me. I can't have problems because people assume that I just want attention. 

Being pretty does not make life easy. Being ordinary makes life easy; you're allowed to be someone who is not ruled by your looks, you're allowed to be smart and funny without people being shocked, you're allowed to be whoever you choose. 

I could go on for much longer but I don't think anyone will read it. I didn't write this to say that anyone else's experience is worth less, I didn't write this to upset anyone. I wrote this so that people could understand that ""winning the genetic lottery"" does not make things easier. Please don't trivialize someone's life because they are pretty, please don't be part of this fucked up society.",TwoXChromosomes

1420393242.0,Why do older never-married women seem to draw scorn from the manosphere?,"I am in my mid-twenties and have decided that I never want to marry. I am not particularly maternal and have decided not to have children for a variety of reasons. I don't see the point of marriage if I never want to have children. I know that I would feel much better with other kinds of relationships or as a single woman after having seen the effect of marriage on the people in my family.

Why do men in the manosphere see women who are unmarried as flawed and too choosy or selfish while they tend to advocate the ""men going their own way"" movement? It seems like there is this idea within the community that refusing to marry women is the worst thing that men can do to them. It's like they assume that the only goal a woman could ever have is to get married and have children. Many of us run from men who would ever mention marriage.

Also, this view of marriage (that it's not worth it) does not seem to be uncommon among my peer group (men and women from 25 to about 35-ish)... maybe it's just that I'm from New York. I see it almost equally among men and women.

1412395706.0,The ER staff wrote me off as a drunk college girl. Turns out I was drugged. I'm so angry.,"The story starts off as I'm sure many do. I decided to go to a bar with a close friend of mine for a drink to let off some steam after a long week. I had two drinks and I barely remember anything from the middle of my second drink until my husband and I left the ER. 
I left my apartment at 10:40ish on Friday thinking I would have a couple drinks, come home, snuggle with my husband and go to sleep. 
    At 1:45ish when my friend took me home he told my husband that something might be off. I don't remember anything. My husband said after I got back, I went to the bathroom claiming I needed to throw up. After a half hour I started screaming for him to help me. He came into the bathroom just in time to see me go into a seizure. He carried me from the floor to our truck and drove me into the ER. When we got there he filled the staff in on what medications that I was on, my medical history (which included seizures), what he had seen, and all the important details. They ignored him, and instead tried to get the information out of me. At the time I was convulsing, screaming, my eyes were dilated/rolling all over, and I would occasionally stop breathing. Obviously in no condition to answer their questions.
    I managed to tell them I had two drinks. The nurse then turned to my husband and asked him how many drink I had *actually* consumed. Because it was clear to her that I was lying. He wouldn't tell me much about what happened during the rest of my stay. Just that he was uncomfortable, angry, and felt like the staff wasn't very concerned with figuring out what was wrong, and that he didn't want to talk about it until we saw my regular doctor. When we called the ER about the results of my blood work, the lady on the phone told me they hadn't bothered to run the tests because I was clearly intoxicated. 
    We were there from 2:30 to 6am and they discharged me with a panic attack and acute alcohol abuse. I wanted to cry. I **did** cry. I felt almost violated in a whole new way. They are doctors, they are supposed to help me and try to figure out what was wrong. All week I've been tired, crabby, and scared to find out what had happened. We finally saw my doctor today and after a very lengthy discussion he confirmed my fears. I had an idiopathic seizure, and that my drink had been tampered with. My blood alcohol level was that of someone who had consumed NINE drinks, and many of my other levels were way off the charts. He recommended we file a police report and offered to talk to the sheriff so that they had a medical opinion on my file. 
The officer to took my statement was very nice. He happened to know the owner of the bar I had been to and went to see if he had cameras on the premises. Turns out they did, but the cameras don't cover the area I was sitting at. The owner was upset, and plans on informing his staff of what happened and reviewing the section of their training that covers suspicious activity/drugging. The report has been filed, I have answered, I just feel......This insane mix of feelings. Relief. Anger. Sadness. Comfort in knowing that my husband took care of me.
EDIT: When I called about blood work I meant that I had called to see if they had ran any drug related tests. Of course they ran the usual stuff. It was the doctor I see on a regular basis who went over everything with me and determined my drink had been tampered with. I mean no offense to anyone in the medical field. I understand that y'all get swamped with people who do lie about these kinds of things. However, I ask that you try to understand some of my frustrations. I came here to tell people my story in hopes that maybe someday, somewhere, someone else will be able to help keep their friends or themselves safe. Not to shout angrily about what happened and to bash on all nurses and doctors. I'm thankful they got me stabilized. They figured out half the puzzle for my husband and I. ",TwoXChromosomes

1432210714.0,[TW] An open letter to my rapist; You found me on facebook yesterday.,"Context: When I was a teenager, I used to hang out in a freeform RPG chatroom. I met some people there, they all seemed like great people, and eventually a group of 6 of us decided to meet up in real life. I formed a close bond with two of them. One was my boyfriend for a few months, but we never had sex (I was a virgin). The other was a great support when I broke up with the first. I spent Christmas the year I was 16 at his house.



Warning: Lengthy. Story form. Extremely personal. Sorry if it sucks, I just had to write it down somewhere.




Dear John,



I haven't thought about you for a long time. Almost 16 years in fact. I thought I never would until you found me on facebook yesterday. I had blocked you out. You said ""You have no idea how long I've been looking for you."" Not ""How are you?"", not ""Sorry"", not even ""Hello!"" You just pointed out that you have been hunting for me. As if I haven't said no to you enough by now.




I did say no, that Christmas Eve in your dingy bedroom. I said it twice; once when your hands were groping at my tits, and once when you were stood over me, naked with a condom in your hand. I was a virgin. I wasn't attracted to you. I didn't want to have sex with you. I was extremely vulnerable after a break-up and it was my first Christmas away from home. I let you because I thought I had to. I didn't enjoy it. I didn't ask if you did. 




I still didn't want to have sex with you when you came to my house for New Years a few days later. But I did, because nobody else would have and I thought if I said yes, I had the control. I made it clear that we weren't dating, and I didn't want to date. I had sex with you because I thought as a 16 year old girl in a big(ish) city that it was what I should be doing. 




I didn't see you again until early summer the next year, by which time I had met my first love, the future father of my child. You insisted on meeting him. I thought I owed you that for some reason. You were horrible to him, and when we got back to my house that evening, you tried to have sex with me again, but I said no this time and I made it stick. You left the next morning under a black cloud. We spoke a week later and you screamed at me that you were in love with me and you couldn't live without me and how dare I fuck you twice and not love you. I deliberately lost your number after that.




Two years later, my beautiful son is 3 months old and I'm finally moving out of my mother's house. The father of my child was having an existential crisis leaving me and my baby to fend for ourselves, so when the phone rang on moving day, I answered and for 2 seconds I was pleased to hear from someone who had once loved me. It didn't last. I remembered how awful you'd been and I made my excuses. We never spoke again. That was November 1999.




I was happy that you were out of my life. 




Two days ago, I got a message from a facebook friend I haven't seen in many years. She tells me of a strange phone call she received, from a person looking for me, but under a name I haven't used regularly since 2004; the same name you knew me as. I didn't make the connection, I assumed it was a telephone scam of some kind. But then your name popped up in my ""other"" inbox on facebook the next day and the bottom fell out of my world.




""You've no idea how long I have been looking for you..."" 




I refused the friend request you sent. I didn't reply to your message. I blocked you. I locked my profile down. I changed my name and my profile picture. I called my mother and cried for a little while, confessing to her for the first time that my first time was not entirely consensual. She cried a little too. But that wasn't enough for you, was it? Not half an hour later, you made another facebook account and sent me this: http://imgur.com/n0yKOVz




I blocked that account too, and reported you for abuse, but the damage is done. You're back in my head now, you weaselly little shit. I can't sleep, I shake when I get a message on facebook, I'm afraid to let my son leave the house. I am terrified. You don't know what you did, or perhaps you don't understand, and I am too afraid to tell you. Fuck you, John. You stole my virginity from me, but miraculously I had forgotten you! You couldn't just leave it alone though, could you? Fuck. You.

1439911117.0,I'm being slut shamed by my own mother for losing my virginity at 20 years old and it hurts,"Here's some background that might put things into perspective. My family is Christian, but we're not very religious. The only way you'd know our family was Christian would be by seeing my mom's #thankyoubasedgod type posts. Even though we're not very religious my mother has always wanted me to be abstinent, something I personally don't believe in. 

Me and my mother aren't close and I'm a very private person. She has always wanted me to be able to talk to her about anything. So when she randomly asked if I was still a virgin, I thought I might give her a chance and tell her the truth; even though I knew that she wanted me to wait til marriage.

I tell her, she doesn't get angry she doesn't yell, but if she is shocked. She doesn't understand why I would want to have sex, as if I needed a reason other than simply wanting to. As if sexual desire is some foreign concept to her or I wouldn't want to have sex unless the man was pressuring me into it. Other than that I thought everything was okay...I was wrong. 

This conversation paved the way for random jokes (asking if I was a thot, I'm going to get pregnant just like she did junior year of college) and comments (my relationship with my husband won't be as special, I didn't think you were that kind of girl, you'll catch a disease). She played them off as if she wasn't being serious, but she just used them to mask her disappointment in me for having sex before marriage with a guy who wasn't my boyfriend (but I actually did and still do like).

It got even worse when I asked to get on birth control. First thing she said was ""you plan on doing it again?"" Basically wanting me to go back to being some weird version of non virgin abstinence. She couldn't understand that I would enjoy my first time and would want to continue having sex with that guy.

Then she found out that I gave him a blow job (first time for that too). All of the sudden I have no self respect/esteem. Apparently I'm slanging dick left and right because I had oral/sex once. She told me we didn't do that when I was your age (I call BS she was my age in the 90s). God forbid I suck a dick, even though when she was my age she was pregnant with me and most likely had sex with guys other than my father before then.

This is has pretty much turned into a rant, but I had to get this out after she sent me a picture of a first date in the 1980's vs 2015 picture with the 2015 girl sucking dick. Then texted me saying don't be that chick, if you get on your knees you don't love yourself. I'm a pretty nonchalant person, but I couldn't help but cry because my own mother was treating me like I was worthless because I wasn't a virgin. I know I that I'm still the same person, but it hurt to have her tell me that I could come to her about these things and when I finally do she slut shames me...Sorry for the long post ._.",TwoXChromosomes

Starting with the middle class and moving on up to families that are more priveladge, there's a belief that minorities are taking advantage of the system because they're lazy and don't want to work. That they could easily find a job if they tried harder. The reality is, there are many reasons why people have trouble getting jobs. It could be a lack of education, a disability, or criminal background, to list a few.

Say you're a mother of three with a lack of education and McDonald's is where you find yourself hired and working. The wage that McDonald's provides is not nearly enough to provide for your family. You're trying to stay afloat and food stamps is what's getting your kids dinner on the table.

Say you have a felony and Wendy's is the only place that will hire you. You're trying to get back on your feet and the system is not making it easy for you. Maybe you have child support. The wages Wendy's provides is not going to cover your basic needs.

Say you were able to get a better job. I guarantee you it's a smaller company than any major fast food restaurant who hire people that are most in need and take advantage of their situation.

The middle class should be blaming McDonald's for the need of government assistance and not the people receiving it.

I feel very unnerved by people's reactions to a recent post on this sub where OP took someone's unsolicited dick pic and made it into an NFT. Guys, this kind of behaviour is not on. It is not okay to take any private photo, whether it be consensual or not, and make it publicly available.

We are all angry and tired of men who are assholes sending unsolicited dick pics to us when we're just trying to get through the day. But reactions like this are inappropriate and should not be encouraged. By doing so, you are behaving no better than the awful men that we are trying to stand up against. This isn't feminism; this is a reactionary response.

That isn't to say that emotions can't motivate people to make positive changes. If people never felt angry about being mistreated, then the world wouldn't have gotten this far in terms of human rights and equity.

But, sometimes our emotions can drive us to do things that can actually cause more harm than good. And these actions may not actually cause the change that we want. This kind of behaviour is one of the many factors that contribute to the maintenance of cycles of hate and anger.

Be the bigger person. Don't stoop down to their levels of behaviour. If someone sends you a dick pic and keeps harassing you, one of the best things you can do is report and block them. And, if you have concerns with your safety, contact the appropriate authorities. More action needs to be taken, of course, to stop this kind of behaviour completely. But, doing the same thing as these people, posting their pictures online, it's not okay.

I may be downvoted because others may assume that, ""if you're not with us, you're against us"". That's not what I am getting at. I hate dick pics, and as a lesbian, I can assure you that I definitely want this shit to be dealt with, because it is annoying, frustrating and aggravating. I do not want to wake up in the morning and have my phone's blue light rays blast a dick pic into my eyes. But, this isn't the right approach.

It's not okay. You know better. You can do better than these awful men.",TwoXChromosomes

1399390708.0,Being a short girl can really suck.,"First of all, I really don't want to offend other short women--I just felt like ranting about my personal issues with being vertically challenged. I know that society acknowledges that short men are treated unfairly, but I think that petite women also get the...""short"" end of the stick.  
  
I know there are some celebrities who defy this, but it seems like the women who are considered the most beautiful tend to be tall and thin, like models. It's frustrating feeling like, no matter how hard I try to look good, I just look dumpy next to my taller friends. Clothes NEVER fit right off the rack, and I get so sick of salespeople telling me to try the children's section. (I'm in my mid-20's!!) It feels like I can't look very fashionable, because clothes never fit my petite frame, and the ones in the ""petites"" sections that I find look like grandma clothes. (Being short also means that a weight loss or gain of 10 lbs, which would be pretty normal on a taller person, can suddenly push you over either side of the line of looking scrawny or overweight...which can make clothes shopping that much more frustrating.)

  I also don't think super-short women get taken nearly as seriously, particularly the ones who look young for their age like I do. I've actually posted about that issue on here before, because it gets exhausting being treated like a child, being asked, ""What do your parents think of that??"" and, god forbid, ""What grade are you in?""   
It's gotten a little better in the past few years, but I felt constantly overlooked for opportunities in my undergrad, and part of it was because I looked so much smaller and younger than my colleagues, even though I was typically about 5 years older due to starting school later. I rarely feel like I'm seen as an actual adult woman, let alone a strong or independent one.  
 
I've gotten so many comments and jokes about my stature since high school, that *most* of the time are supposed to be lighthearted, but it seriously gets old. Being called a 12 year old at 25 isn't cute anymore. 

  And god, don't even get me started on people picking me up! Ugh.

I was on the pill and got pregnant.  I subsequently miscarried, but the whole thing was complicated by the fact that when I went to the doctor after bleeding for two weeks straight, I was told that prolonged bleeding can be completely normal and was likely just a fluke.    Fast forward to another week, and appointment, later and they finally ran a pregnancy test.  Things ended naturally shortly thereafter.  

I then learned that the pill needs to be taken within a two hour window every day in order to avoid pregnancy.  There was one time that month I took it several hours late.  I don't think women are told that with hormones, you really need to keep the level steady.  There were several times in my early 20s that I really thought if I just took it the next morning it was fine.

1397572785.0,"I am a woman, I have been abused before, I have almost been date raped, and I am often ostracized by feminists inside and outside of this subreddit because I don't agree with them 100% on things like rape culture or how to tell if a man is creepy.","At 10:00, I have to go to counseling because I was beaten by my troop leader's husband when I was a kid and I was always afraid as a kid that he was going to punish me for speaking out. I was further traumatized when my parents told me when I was a teenager that there was some strong evidence that I was sodomized in daycare when I was 2. While I don't have any traumatic memories of this, they told me at an age when I just assumed that the event did take place and that thought traumatized me. This has led me to have vaginismus, which has lasted even after I learned to cope with those events in my life. To make things even worse, when I was 21, I hung out with a bad crowd and I decided one day to down a bunch of everclear. I blacked out and when I came to, my pants were off, my friend's brother-in-law was massaging my legs, and when I asked him what he was doing, he told me we were going to have sex. (Don't worry. I yelled ""rape"" and got some people to supervise me in that room). 

Rape is a very sensitive topic for me and I have spent a lot of time trying to find the source of this social ill. When I was younger, my feminist aunt convinced me that the problem is that we live in a rape culture. I felt confirmed in this when I moved away from my high school (where I had the reputation of being the ugly, sweatpant-wearing girl that no guy wanted to fuck) to being in a college town, where every guy on the street asked me for sex or a date. I believed the mantra we women are taught (for the best of reasons), which is that ""no means no."" I told my guy friends that I hated being asked for sex multiple times, and they all explained to me that they only asked me once at the beginning of our friendship but when I explained that I had a sexual disorder, they left me alone. For other women they meet at the bars, they say almost all (but not every) girl rejects them the first time, often because they grew up in a sex-negative environment and need to be warmed up by being asked in gentle ways multiple times. None of these guys ever ended up stalking me, even the guy I ended up having sex with after I initiated it (after being friends with him for 3 years.) We even ended up having a bad fallout, and he unfriended me and deleted my number instead of stalking me. So not rapists or stalkers. Just guys with unconventional views on what the best practices are for getting women. 2 days ago, someone on this subreddit started a thread about what it means to be a ""creepy"" guy. I mentioned why a non-creepy guy can ask for sex multiple times, and I got a bunch of angry responses, one even accused me of being an MRA, which is kind of funny to me because I have been accused of being a troll on the mensrights subreddit in the past.

With rape issues, it's also pretty bad. I did some research and found out that our legal system has a few bad men with some backwards views, but judges who make those bad calls get public outcries and often have to resign and statistics show that police officers arrest men who are accused of rape more than 80% of the time. So I learned not to look for explanations of rape culture, but larger problems in the legal system to explain why rape is under-reported and is not always convicted. 

I've tried debating about rape culture but I often get accused of being a rape apologist. On my Facebook, a guy basically called me that just because I said that the line ""I know you want it"" from ""Blurred Lines"" can be about rape, but it can also be dirty talk. Another guy friend explained what rape culture is to me in 5-year-old talk. This made me feel conflicted, because it's taboo to talk about some of the things from my past to people I know. I wanted him to know I'm not spoiled or jaded, but I knew it would inappropriate to out myself as someone who has dealt with violence before. 

Of course, as someone who has almost been date raped, I strongly disagree with a lot of what rape culture theory says about date rape. I definitely think we should educate women about date rape and even if it leads to them feeling guilt (which I think is a larger psychological phenomenon that gives people a false sense of control over a traumatic event rather than the result of poor education about date rape), we should err on the side of education. I was glad to see one of my guy friends write an analogy on his Facebook page, which is that in this culture, we remind people who don't lock their doors to lock their doors in case they fall prey to a burglar, and that if they don't lock their doors, people still blame the burglar for the burglary rather than the homeowner. I thought it was a great analogy, but one of his female friends said that she was sexually assaulted and had some (unspecified) person, not persons, blame her for the assault and she went on to accuse my guy friend of having white male privilege and being immune to acts of violence. She said only a woman can challenge her views. My friend's brother informed her that both himself and my friend had been victims of crime before, but she wouldn't apologize. I ended up going on my Facebook account that has a fake name and outed myself as having been the victim of a violent crime and an attempted date rape and told her she was being unreasonable. She never apologized for her actions. She just stopped responding to that discussion.

On this subreddit, I have mentioned my disgust at not erring on the side of education in terms of date rape before, and I got a bunch of down votes. I thought that was very unfair, and I felt vindicated when the RAINN came out and said a lot of things I say about rape culture.

If you believe we live in a rape culture or that a guy who asks a girl for sex multiple times is creepy, I respect that. I think we should be able to disagree civilly. I think if our views don't make sense, we should ask each other where we are coming from before we make big assumptions, like that a critic of rape culture hasn't ever been the victim of a crime, or someone who believes in unconventional views on creepers
 is an MRA. 

Edit: I wasn't saying only rape victims should have these opinions. I was saying people shouldn't just assume that I'm jaded and don't know anything about rape because I don't share their opinions.

1423590909.0,TwoX women's opinions on porn? All views welcome.,"The piece on porn actually made me very sad yesterday. While some good discussions were generated, anything vaguely anti-porn or expressing the view that porn maybe isn‚Äôt the greatest thing since sliced bread were downvoted to hell. In a subreddit for women, I‚Äôm not sure in that post that there were enough experiences shared by women. 

So I‚Äôd like to share mine and others garnered from my female colleagues after we discussed the first post yesterday. First off, my husband and I have a wonderful relationship. When we first started dating, he watched whatever kind of porn he wanted to and I was fine with that. But when we started getting more serious, I asked him to stop watching it. It‚Äôs natural in a long term relationship for both parties to be attracted to other people. It happens, it‚Äôs natural, and it‚Äôs expected. However, it‚Äôs a little different for me to think about my husband getting off to other naked girls or desiring other naked women. <- and that‚Äôs the point that seems to be hard for men commenting on the other post to get. It‚Äôs not wrong or ridiculous for me to feel that way, I would compare it to the feelings you may get knowing your wife/gf gets off to other men or thinks about other men while having sex with you. It wouldn‚Äôt make you feel very good. I‚Äôm very self-confident when it comes to my body and I know/feel that I‚Äôm attractive so it‚Äôs not a matter of being insecure in comparison to the actresses. 

I desperately want to be the ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù and be totally down with him watching porn. But I‚Äôm not, and I‚Äôm glad to have a husband who understands. But I feel a lot of women in my generation are having to pretend to be ok with something they‚Äôre not ok with. In this day and age, and even on this website, it is not ok to be uncomfortable with porn. I sometimes wonder if there was a comparable equivalent of female porn, if more women would start to be accepting of porn or even if men would become empathetic to the view some women have now regarding porn (and I will share a story about one of my friends in a comment). Let‚Äôs face it, romance novels and romance movies aren‚Äôt quite the same thing. Sure you can entertain a few fantasies regarding the storyline in your mind and you can get a bit hot and bothered while watching, but that‚Äôs not the same as seeing two of the characters getting down and dirty in a way that‚Äôs geared for women while furiously stroking your clit. Books and movies are a different medium and not necessarily as readily available or covering as many topics/sexual acts as porn. 

Anyways, following a discussion about why I was uncomfortable with porn, my husband stopped and I have supplied him with whatever photos he needs to get off when I am too tired, or even allow him to suck on my breasts while I talk dirty and he jacks off. We are young enough that our sex life is very busy and thus so far porn hasn‚Äôt been an issue for us. But I worry about what will happen in the future, when perhaps humans will become more internet sexual, when I am older and my body isn‚Äôt as nice as it is now, when my sex drive has slowed down due to having kids... I want my husband to be satisfied. But the thought of him getting off to hot 19 year-olds when I‚Äôm 40 years old is devastating right now. Perhaps in the future, again, that will change as more women will have to accept that porn is here to stay.

What I‚Äôm interested in is hearing the women of TwoX‚Äôs opinions on porn. I‚Äôll share two other stories in the comment, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious of how my ladies feel.

1524037955.0,I was violently sexually assaulted a few months ago and I wanted to share what is probably an unpopular opinion: please stop telling us survivors that we need to report what happened.,"This is partially a rant and partially advice.

I was violently sexually assaulted between Christmas and New Years last year. The experience and trauma are still very fresh to me. I am someone who heals by sharing, so I have been making an effort to reach out to my support system and talk about what happened with those I trust. Right now, I am surprising myself with how well I seem to be handling things (January and February of this year were a completely different story). The effects of the assault come and go. Sometimes I'm fine, and sometimes, quite suddenly, I'm not. I won't think about it for days, and then I'll randomly find myself up until 4am, unable to think about anything else - replying it in my mind. 

All of this is to say: I'm both okay, and I'm not. I'm functioning, and I'm not. I'm dealing with it, and I will continue to deal with it for a very long time. 

I realized tonight that the most helpful support I have received while dealing with this hasn't been practical, it has been hearing the words ""I believe that what happened to you was sexual assault. I believe that you were sexually assault."" AND THAT IS IT. FULL STOP. 

I have relived every moment of my assault more times than I can count. I have written out what happened to help me wrap my mind around it. It is a constant and inescapable burden. It is a constant questioning of my self worth and my dignity. It does not surprise me at all that my mind tries to convince me that what happened wasn't so bad; that I'm fine now so it couldn't have been that bad, clearly I'm over reacting. But I'm not, and a part of me knows that. 

There is unbelievable value in having your feelings and experience validated period, but it is infinitely more valuable when your autonomy and humanity have been violated. I don't want to hear that you're sorry this happened - so am I. I don't want you to just ""check-in"" on how I'm doing. I don't want you to tip-toe around talking about sex, or violence or dating with me. I don't want to feel like you're humoring or just placating me. I want to hear that you believe me, that what happened to me was terrible and without a doubt sexual assault. I want to hear that you're proud of me for simply continuing to BE - because that's fucking hard right now. I want you to understand that I'm beyond angry, and I am scared, and that whether or not I report my assault is entirely up to me.

I don't want to be questioned on whether or not I told him to stop - in my case, and doubtless in many others, whether I said stop is ENTIRELY irrelevant to what happened. It didn't matter to him, and it doesn't matter now. I don't want to be told how important it is that I report my attacker to the police - I know it's important. I don't want to hear how I have a duty to other women - I know I do. I fucking know. But I also know that the reporting process can be extremely traumatizing and that victims often feel more violated after being questioned.  I know it's important and that I could help prevent future attacks, but to be honest, those things aren't nearly as important to me right now as getting through the day without breaking down. I am saving myself right now, don't make me feel guilty about that. 

I'm not saying that people shouldn't report, or anything like that. All I'm saying is that we don't need you telling us your opinion on whether or not we should. We, the collective survivors, don't need to be told that the burden of our attackers' future assaults is on us. Fuck that. I am surviving his assault every day. I am fighting the demons he created every day. I am waking up, and showing up, and beating him, EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Don't you dare put the weight of his transgressions on me.

Sorry, this really isn't directed at anyone who is likely to read it here, but I wanted to put it out there regardless. At the very least, I hope other survivors might read this and realize that they're not alone and don't need to feel guilty about taking care of themselves, even if that means not reporting. Do what you have to do. I love you. I support your decision. I believe you. 

EDIT: Okay, I hear you guys. Encouraging reporting, and making sure people know it's an option, are very important. My point wasn't to say that people shouldn't report, it was more that framing reporting as the victim's ""duty"" really makes it seem like the victim is to blame for the attacker's future assaults if they don't report, and that's just wrong. Please be mindful of that because it really is another form of victim blaming to tell a victim it's their fault if it happens again. It's not. It's the attacker's fault. ",TwoXChromosomes

First of all, the number of times that I see upvoted content that's about shutting down ""bitchy"" feminists makes me want to puke. Reddit loves to think that it's a liberal community but it's sexist as all shit. Guess what? It's actually really NOT HELPFUL for gender equality if you upvote things that trivialize actual gender issues. (And for that matter, race issues - reddit's got tons of problems with that).

I'm not talking about jokes (fuck, I love humor of all kinds, especially Stephen Colbert, who is referenced in the video), I'm talking about using 'feminist' like it's a dirty word. I'm talking about calling anyone who speaks up against racism or sexism a SJW because you're too fucking entitled to understand that your opinion isn't the only one that matters. 

The video depicts a debate about some argument that was had when Stephen Colbert said something that some folks on the internet found offensive. In this video, they're trying to have a discourse about it. On the show they have a woman who is frustrated about it, who's clearly trying not to lash out at the host. After the host interrupts her and calls her opinion stupid and she has no time to respond, they bring in a white guy to comment instead.

To be completely honest with you, I don't think the woman in the video was being completely unreasonable. I think she was frustrated, articulating it well, and then someone called her 'stupid' before turning it over to another white male.

Reddit upvotes this shit as though that news host were some kind of hero-genius-badass. It's really fucking upsetting. I see top posts about women who lied about being raped, giving people the absurd idea that it's common for people to lie about it. I love reddit, but I see this shit all the time and it's getting to the point where it's just 100% disheartening. 

I hate it because I think it really is a reflection of the real world and where were at as a culture. I'm not offended so much as depressed. It makes me so sad. I also know I'd be called an SJW for this post, which makes me sadder.

One of them calls over to ask me why my dog was kicking grass-up and I explained that he does that after he goes to the bathroom it's a dog's instinct to bury after they go.

The boy then asked me if I wanted to go to the dance with him which was a really strange question to ask and I politely declined. And then it was immediately followed up by the phrase but you're looking damn sexy right now.

1405403554.0,"""Young women with sexy social media photos seen as less competent"" study is extremely bigoted. X-post from science.","This is a perfect example of pop media helping to perpetuate negative female stereotypes (in a most insidious way too, if you ask me). Sorry for the essay, but I think the topic is important, especially since it was on the front page. 

(Original article: http://www.franchiseherald.com/articles/5790/20140714/study-young-women-with-sexy-social-media-photos-seen-as-less-competent.htm)

Articles like this frustrate me to no end. Aside from the scientific unsoundness (poor control, subjectivity, not huge sample size, etc), this article is also terribly bigoted. Hear me out. 

My question for the authors: if they were intending on investigating ""perceptions of sexualized versus non-sexualized photos""...why only use a female subject? It implies that a current ""problem"" is that **too many women** are posting sexy photos, which in turn devalues their perceived worth. This suggests there is no good way for women to sexualize their bodies, while completely ignoring the question of sexuality and perceived competence in social media *in general*. 

If they had studied both men and women, this could have been a wonderful segue into discussion of sexuality and professionalism. Or even gender-roles, sexuality, and professionalism. But instead the authors focus on women and suggest the problem is in the perceived ""sexiness of women"".

The article seems to underscore that sexuality in a woman who wants to be competent and successful is a big no-no...that being ""homely"" or posting a photo of yourself on vacation (but not in a bikini of course) is the only way to have a respectable image as a woman. 

> Those who post sexy photos may risk negative reactions from their peers, but those who post more wholesome photos may lose out on social rewards, including attention from boys and men

What? Now you're suggesting to our young women & girls (who are the apparent target audiences for this article) that positive reactions can be defined as ""attention from boys and men""?  Way to confuse a young girl even more.

Not only is the article itself extremely gender-role biased (20 year old who loves Twilight, Lady Gaga and the Notebook? Come on), but it's suggesting that the problem here is women's sexuality. Let's not even get into the suggestion that if women were to wear only ""jeans and a t-shirt"" that this is classified as ""un-sexy"".

I guess the author's intentions were good (don't feel pressured to sexualize your body; don't rely so much on appearance)...but contrary to the intent the actual impact is the exact opposite. It over-emphasizes sexuality in women (as a negative) and underscores the importance of needing to ""appear"" a certain way in order for women to be successful. 

Edit 1: spelling

Edit 2: Many of you are raising great points such as, ""but over-sexualization of women *is* a problem"", ""We should be encouraging our young women to stop over-sexualizing themselves""...and even ""but sexuality *is* negative for professionalism"". And yes, this article doesn't directly imply that men don't suffer the same problems.

Those are all valid points. I am however, trying to say that popular culture sexualizes women *enough*. There is a strong pressure for women to be ""sexy"", and yet there is also an associated negative connotation. We don't need this in an academic/scientific setting as well as in pop culture.

I just think the study could have raised an important issue in a more gender-neutral way, rather than further associate negativity with women's sexuality. It just acts as confirmation bias for those of us that believe ""women are sluttier than men"". If we want to encourage women to be less sexual, we should stop ""shaming"" them by saying things like, ""if you post a sexy photo of yourself then you're just asking other people to see you as less competent"". 

TLDR: A discussion of sexuality and appearance should not automatically correlate to #girlproblems. If we're striving towards a more gender-equal society, over-emphasizing women's outward image is not the way to go.",TwoXChromosomes

1399404439.0,Friend is Jealous When I Make Other Friends,"Hi all. I'm just looking to vent a little and seek some advice. I'll try to keep this somewhat short. 

Me: I'm pretty shy/timid and it's often hard for me to make new friends. 
J: She's very outgoing and talkative with practically anyone. 

I've been friends with J for around 4 years. When we first met she was super super sweet and really supportive. We had a similar sense of humor so we clicked really well and became close. I have other friends but J was someone who I spoke with on a consistent basis, usually daily. Once we got more comfortable with each other, I feel like J's real personality began to show and I learned she had a snarky/bitchy side (I guess everyone does though occasionally, I know I do). 

Anyways, over the course of our friendship J has made a lot of new friends. Maybe she would just get excited to meet someone new, but at times she'd hold newer friends on a pedestal while kinda treating her more long term friends like they're boring. Sometimes I felt like she was trying hard to make me jealous because she'd praise her new friend and go on and on about how wonderful and supportive they are. I felt a little annoyed at times but never really jealousy as I was used to how frequently she met new people. 

After going through a kind of depressive/weird phase that I kept mostly to myself, I felt a surge of confidence recently and began putting myself out there more and talking to people. I met someone new, I'll call her B, who I instantly clicked with and we shared a lot in common. B began introducing me to some of her friends who were equally as great as her. Anyways, J became super jealous even though I never ignored her or changed the amount of time I spend talking to her. Last Friday night B wanted to have a movie night at her place with a few people, she told me that I could bring J along if I wanted to (they don't really know each other but B is familiar with J). I invited J to come and she got totally bitchy with me and kind of shat on the idea. She later sent me a long message saying she was jealous and that she feels like I'm forgetting her and replacing her with someone else. She said she feels like I'm HER bestie and that it makes her feel weird that I'm getting close with someone else. She said she knows it's irrational to feel that way and that I should be allowed to have other friends but that she can't help the way she feels. I was a bit shocked that she said she felt like I'm forgetting her because I still talk to her all the time.

Another surprise too is that J hasn't really had much enthusiasm for our friendship for the past several months. I was having some health problems (nothing serious) and anxiety that made me a bit depressed so I wasn't my usual self but it wasn't like I was a downer either. I've always felt like I've had to entertain J or she gets bored easily. Sometimes it's exhausting. Perhaps I'm a bit annoyed while typing this and I feel it's a bit too one sided, but there ARE still things I like about J and we do have good conversations most of the time. 

In the moment, I reassured J that nothing was changing with our friendship and that I still liked her just as much. Honesty though, I feel really pissed off. I keep feeling like she is not someone who cares about my best interest. Especially since she knows that I've had a rough patch the past few months, this new friendship was something that really perked me up. I feel like any normal person would be happy about that for someone. She KNOWS I barely have any friends, why is she upset about me meeting more people? Especially since she is constantly doing things with people. Does she want me to be friendless and miserable forever?

1446381144.0,"Is ""female intuition"" about cheating a thing? How do you deal with jealousy and suspicion?","Lately, I've been really really concerned that my husband (of 2 months) has been cheating on me. He is a very sociable person, while I am more of an introvert and often he will go out and I will opt to stay in. This is fine, it has been this way for most of our relationship, its good that he has a social life and is popular. 

But recently, there have been some red flags. Individually, they can all be explained away (We have spoken to each other and he reassured me about each of them) but when put together they look really sketchy.

The worst example I can give you. He went out for halloween night, I stayed in. He wasn't home when I woke up around 8am. I called his phone number and a girl (I've met her before) answered that he had got drunk and they were both in a hotel room, he was passed out. I didn't get suspicious, because why would she tell me this? It honestly didn't seem like  she was hiding anything. But, it is now 12 hours later and he still isn't home. I called him and he told me he was having dinner with that girl. I'm just really hurt, especially since he knows I have been having trust issues recently. 

I'm not asking IF he is cheating, because it is really impossible to know. I just wanted to hear your eperiences. When did that ""feeling"" turn out to be right or wrong? Should I try to ignore it or deal with it on my own? Are there things he can be doing to help reassure me and do I have the right to ask this from him? How can I look after myself, how can I deal with these horrible feelings in a healthy way without pushing him away? 

I guess that I am most scared that I am going crazy, putting 2 and 2 together to get 5. I feel like the more I freak out about this, the more I will push him away. But I also don't want to be walked all over.

**Tl;Dr Got suspicious that husband is cheating, need support and advice on how to handle all these feelings in a constructive way**

UPDATE: He just got back...a full 32 hours after he left, still wearing his halloween costume, very drunk. He came to me and tried to hug me and kept saying ""I love you, do you love me?"". I guess he is feeling at least a little remorseful. I said that actions speak louder than words and I need to sleep. He finally left me alone, smoked a cigarette in the bathroom (I don't like smoking in the house) and thew up. He is now passed out in the bedroom, and I'm on the sofa with the cats. I guess we will talk tomorrow after work. Thanks so much for everyones advice, I really appreciate it. I don't really know what is going to happen next, but it helps to have heard your perspectives.

Tonight I had a bath.
I'm more of a shower kinda gal, so this was my first organised effort to have a relaxing evening of pampering myself in about a year.

My 7yo son is all sorted and finishing off his dinner, having already done his reading to earn some time to play Pokemon after dinner - CHECK.

My partner-in-crime is on hand to supervise any remaining loose ends - CHECK.

I run my bath, with the added bonus of a Lush bath bomb that I bought about 8 months ago and found last week after finally getting around to sorting out the upstairs cupboard - bubbles, pink fizzy foam shit, weird smelling steam - CHECK.

I am in the bath for no more than 30 seconds when a lurker at the threshold pipes up with, ""Mummy, I need the toilet."" 
*le sigh*  ""Okay sweetie, just come on in then."" 
... 
""But it's a poo""

OF COURSE it is.

""Alright, well, if you could *possibly* wait for 20 minutes, that would be nicer for me.""
""Okay, I'll wait!""

Everything is going as planned - I soak in the fizzy pink shit goodness, I wash my hair, I use BOTH of those facewash product things that apparently do different things and even get *nearly* the whole 3 minutes of my 3-minute-miracle conditioner.

""Mummy, I really need it""
PANIC.
""Okay, I'm almost done - can you wait just 2 minutes more?""
I frantically grab the foot scrub because DAMMIT THIS WAS THE PLAN!

30 seconds later: ""I'm really desperate""
Resignation sets in.  ""No problem, sweetie, you can come in, I'm about done anyway""
""No, I don't want to do it with you in there""
OKAY, JEEZ I'M MOVING.

30 seconds later, the bath is draining and I'm scooping poop out of pyjama pants.

EDIT/UPDATE: to respond to the 2 comments that seem to be trending, the ""point"" of the thread was that a doctor describing her husbands boner to a male doctor as an ""abscess"" was kind of funny.  Regarding the deeply philosophical ""life choices"" angle that a lot of people ran with (slash are projecting their own situations on to), I don't think she regrets anything, or that she doesn't take pride in her work, or that her husband is lazy...  I think she's just expressing that she's so busy that otherwise recreational activities have become an obligatory item on a long checklist.

We didn't have sex until a year into our relationship. I didn't even do oral sex for 7-8 months into it. Not once did he pressure me. It's been nearly four years now and I still have trouble with sex sometimes. I think I posted on here awhile agoabout my fears concerning opening up the relationship so he could get the sexual outlets he needs. We still have that agreement. But I don't think he has acted on it yet. God, I was so worried about it when I posted months ago... Now I'm at the stage that I'd will even suggest tindr matches as it appears we kind of have the same taste in women (bisexual here). If I see a cute girl somewhere, he's the one I nudge covertly. If I think an actress on TV is particularly gorgeous, I excitedly pull him over for a look. It's actually a really fun part of our relationship.

Anyway, I could not gush over this man enough. He is amazing. The most compassionate, intelligent, caring and interesting person I know. We're getting married soon. Soon. 6 months? We're not having a wedding. Maybe a tiny ceremony with immediate family and a pretty dress. No engagement ring either.

I was fearful and angry towards most men until I met him. Sometimes I still freak out. I'm bipolar and I'm prone to periods of... well. Yeah. He calms me down. He puts up with my shit. Until he calls me out on it. He doesn't let me go too far. He isn't a doormat. He's perfect. He's taught me so much about myself. How to become a better person. By having the right mix of compassion and understanding without letting me ever, ever take advantage of him, manipulate him or cause him to lose a part of himself to me.

Oral sex is hard for me. Well, not so much oral sex. But when a man comes inside my mouth, I freak out. The last time I did I was being raped.

I am always grateful to him. I think about it almost every day and I tell him often. I want to be a better person for him, a girlfriend he deserves. I'm the one he loves, but he deserves so much more. And he was the one that made me feel capable of being that person.

I told him again today how much he means to me, and (unusually) I initiated sex. I gave him a blowjob. Usually we use condoms, so it was nice to be spontaneous. He told me when he was going to come. He wanted to give me warning. Even when he is at the brink of orgasm he is still taking care of my needs. I told him that it was okay, and to go ahead and come.

I have no filtering system at all. I said he tasted like play dough and he laughed.

1702858513.0,"I can't speak for all trans women, but (while the sentiment is appreciated), maybe don't say ""F**k Passing?"" It might not be received the way you intended.","So, I'm a trans woman. And I just [posted in another thread about a creeper](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18kid8r/just_had_my_first_creep_experience/)... but forget that for now. I mentioned that I don't pass (because I didn't know if it was worse if the creeper was treating me as a woman or NOT treating me as a woman.) And a few well-wishers - allies, even! - were saying ""F\*\*k passing!""

And I absolutely get that that's coming from a place of good will and positive vibes. But when you tell a trans woman, ""F\*\*k passing"" it's not going to be received the way you think.

I think the unstated assumption of ""F\*\*k passing"" is that it is followed up by: ""Not passing doesn't make you less of a woman!"" or ""Not passing does not make you a person of less value."" etc.

And yes. That's true. But ""passing"" is *not* some unrealistic standard imposed by the patriarchy that justifies or does not justify whether we're a ""good"" person or not. Passing has *real life consquences.* It's not like saying ""F**k thin! Being overweight doesn't make you less of a person."" It's like telling a person in a wheelchair: ""F**k walking! Not being able to walk doesn't make you less of a person!"" And while that is *objectively true*, being able *to* walk would make life a hell of a lot easier and would open up a lot of opportunities.

First, ""passing"" brings safety from the most violent of transphobes. If you look like a woman, no TERF will harass you for using the ""wrong"" bathroom. If you look like a woman, no drunken lout will punch you for ""dressing like a f\*\*\*\*t.""

But beyond safety, ""passing"" is about being able to be *seen* as the gender we are. It's about being automatically *treated* as a woman, automatically *not* treated as a man.

This is because for (many) trans women, transphobia is the *least* of our worries. Certainly, it is the topping on the shit sundae, but we were truly f-ed over by nature/God long before the Republicans got to us, who internally made our brains work against us by giving us the wrong hormones. Who made our bodies twisted and mutilated through puberty. And most importantly, forced our outward appearance to make people make assumptions about us that were not just *wrong* but *hurtful*, even when those people *mean us no harm*.

Strangers are going to treat me like a man. (Even friends sometimes forget.) That means men treat me like men. (Indeed, the original post - about a creep peeking through my windows) probably thought that because it was ""another man"", it was ""no big deal."" And women treat me like men. And that is the *worst* feeling in the world. When I see a pretty woman, and see how they're dressed and maybe wonder how they did their hair or where they got those shoes - she immediately gets uncomfortable because she (perhaps prudently!) assumes that she's fallen under ""the male gaze."" They may even think I'm dangerous!

Compliments from women are appreciated, compliments from men are creepy. The same sort of body contact, social interactions, physical space, conversation topics, even, as mentioned, a look, are sources of joy when coming from a woman, sources of panic and fear and discomfort and disgust when coming from a ""man"".

Imagine that you looked so *wrong* that people that you want to get to know, to seek friendship with, to just pass the time in camaraderie, *shudder* when you so much as look at them. At being Frankenstein's monster, and your attempts to befriend the villagers are always met with torches and pitchforks.

This has *nothing to do* with unrealistic body standards. To me, passing as an ""ugly woman"" would be better for me than being seen as a ""handsome man."" (Which I have been told I am, by credible but clueless friends and relatives.)

So much of the anxiety/depression/discomfort (we've settled on the term 'dysphoria', I think, in the trans community) that trans women experience is not just from an internal mismatch of brain and body. It's from the fact that we are *socially excluded* from the life events that we would enjoy. I've never been invited to a slumber party. I've never participated in a makeover. I don't get invited to go clothes shopping (and there isn't a store that sells clothes that flatter my linebacker figure.) Women don't hug me like they do other women.

Have you ever seen the ""Just Girly Things"" Instagram account? Imagine wanting that - all of that - and then knowing that *you can never have that.* Or if you *do* have that, that you are *very lucky* and it's because *someone made a conscious effort to give you that, knowing that you needed it.* That the things that every other woman can take for granted has to come because of someone else's charity and conscious kindness.

A lot of things that cisgender allies often don't get is that being openly trans is not like being openly gay. People can immediately tell when you are openly trans just by looking. If you're gay and going out to get a pint of milk, nobody cares, not even homophobes, because there's no *context* for that. Nobody ever says: ""I can't sell you this unless I can check your ID and make sure you get an erection from Hustler magazine."" But being trans is 100% visual, 100% of the time.

It *is* possible for trans women to ""boy-mode"" for short times, if we need to for *physical* safety, but it takes a *horrible* mental toll on us. I *did not even realise how bad it was* until I decided to fully socially transition, and was asked to fill out a survey on my mental health by my doctor. All my life I always answered questions about: ""Have you thought about suicide in the past two weeks"" with things like: ""Often"" or ""Constantly"" and for the first time I was able to answer with ""Seldom."" It was a *night and day difference* and I have been struggling with suicidal ideation, depression, and even been passively suicidal - and at one point, *actively suicidal* \- for my entire life.

At least is is for me. Again, I can't speak for all trans women.

So - yes, right on. I *do not have pass* for my life to have value. But *passing* is still going to be important, and I can't just say f\*\*k it.",TwoXChromosomes

I saw this woman being told that she was playing games, that she was manipulative, that she was immature, that if she really loved and trusted her partner she would ""just tell by his behavior"" -- So basically she is allowed to vet him, but only so much.

But of course no one ever says what ""too much"" actually is. So it's just about policing a woman and making her feel like there's something wrong with her if she wants to make sure her partner isn't abusive. 

What's the most heartbreaking about this is how many women I have heard repeating something similar to this. ""I'M A COOL GIRL, IM NOT LIKE OTHER LITTLE GIRLS, I DONT HATE MEN SO I DONT PLAY STUPID GAMES LIKE THIS!""

I weep for this generation of women. Seeing ideaology like this creep up on this sub hurts. 

Just so we're clear: 

**IT IS NOT MANIPULATIVE TO KEEP YOURSELF SAFE.** 

**IT IS NOT A RED FLAG TO TEST FOR ABUSE.**

If you are out here telling women otherwise, you hate women. 

I am so tired of hearing ""but why didn't she leave when he ______."" this is why.

1424897869.0,Gynecologists: a rant.,"I hope I'm posting this in the right subreddit:

When did gynecologists become so cold? Does the female reproductive system have the ability to suck out a Gynecologist's soul? What happened to compassion, and taking patients seriously? 

I got very serious about my feminine health after my grandmother, who birthed seven children, was diagnosed at the age of 79 with ovarian cancer. She underwent a full hysterectomy and chemo and thankfully, was declared cancer free 18 months after her diagnosis. This was when I was 18, had just started my first job that offered health benefits and had to find a new doctor on my own, as my previous one was the same as my mother's and was not covered by my insurance. 

It was a female doctor and she was awful. During my first exam with her, I tensed up when she took out that horrible duck bill, jaws-of-life for your vagina. I had told her I was sexually active during their interrogations. She asked if I was afraid of the tool, to which I replied yes they are uncomfortable and pinch me. Her reply? ""Well you have sex don't you? This shouldn't be a problem."" Had she never saw a penis before? Because that duck bill torture device is DEFINITELY not the same thing as a penis. That was my first and last appointment with her.

By the time my next yearly exam came around, I had found a new doctor. A male doctor. Surprisingly I was not as uncomfortable with a stange, elderly man staring into my cave of wonders as I thought I would be. What I did have a problem with was how clinical he was. I explained I get horrible mood swings and depression before my period from the hormonal levels fluctuating. His advice? Get 8 hours of sleep, take B vitamins, and cut out caffeine - no coffee, tea, soda, and yes - no chocolate. I thought he had to be digging into the medicine cabinet because he was definitely on something if he thought I was going to cut out soda and chocolate- my two major cravings during my cycle. He also attempter to get me to take a high hormone level pill when I explained I had tried multiple pills as birth control in the past - from average to the lowest level of hormones - and I either became violently aggressive or suicidal. He still pushed it, so I tried it but as soon as I felt the slightest bit down, I was off it. 

I just called today to schedule an appointment with a third gynecologist - a female. I am hoping she can help me with my menstrual cramps, as they are so bad I'm currently missing a lot of work because no amount of OTC medicine can stop these. There have been times I debated going to the hospital and begging for an epidural, they are that bad. I am hoping the third time's the charm.

TL/DR: if you took the time to read my rant, thank you. I hope you, the reader, have had nothing but pleasant experiences with your lady doctors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: To the people who are saying I'm being whiney about the second doctor, understand that it was not just his suggestion of cutting those things out. It was the fact that I felt brushed off. I explained to him I was already taking B-complex and D vitamins and and aside from ""hell week,"" the week before my period starts, I don't drink soda, no tea unless I have a cold, no coffee unless it was a night of rough sleep, and no chocolate. I was already at my wit's end with the side effects of my period and felt he did not take me seriously because he didn't even bring up any suggestions for birth control until my next period in which I bled so severely I ended up going to the ER, and a follow up appointment with him after that. 

To the people saying I was backing the first doctor up in her appointments, I did not stop her. That conversation occurred during the prep process and right before she inserted the instrument. I am an adult, and although it is extremely uncomfortable, I'm not going to waste their time because it's unpleasant. 

To the people who understand the struggle and have wished me luck, thank you. ",TwoXChromosomes
1325960864.0,DAE not like having female friends?,"Hi, TwoX. I was wondering if anyone else had this problem.

I'm a woman, but I've found that pretty much all my friendships with women have been really exhausting and not all that rewarding. I dunno what it is, but people seem to have trouble reading me. Maybe my face doesn't display emotion readily enough? But women tend to expect their girl friends to be all giggly and emotionally reactive: around my female friends, I have to play the part of a fourteen-year-old at a sleepover or else be called a ""stone-cold bitch."" It's really exhausting to try and be something I don't feel like I am. And then, there's the ruminating. Over-analysis and creation of social drama is like a pastime to them. And of course, you have to participate in it: ""Validate me, please!"" I'm not saying all women are necessarily like this (maybe it's just because I'm in college?): it's just how my female friendships seem to function.

I would just make friends with guys, but I've had very few guy friendships that didn't end with one or the other of us getting too attached unrequitedly. I guess what I really want is the kind of friendships men seem to have with other men, where there's not that pressure to share every single goddamn thought that's on your mind and you can just do things together. No worries, no drama.

Which is why I believe downvoting is unhelpful and may even make things worse for the victim.

1. There is a chance the victim may not see the downvotes as an indictment on their words or their abuser and instead see it as proof their abuser is right. ""Even these strangers think I'm wrong/ worthless.""



2. In order to help, we need them to engage. Why would someone want to engage if they are essentially being shouted down by the collective everytime they speak?

Some general comments though - 

* I think asking ""what do I do?"" in the original post was pretty stupid, obviously the answer is ""just stop"" if I don't like it.  I was mostly hoping for a discussion and some comments from other people who have maybe had similar experiences or insight in to other people's thought processes. I fully take responsibility for what I've done, and I'm ashamed of it, but I know myself enough that if I don't figure out *why* I do this then I'll probably end up doing it again if I'm drunk, lonely, sad, whatever, like [tw98](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/duc3w/im_one_of_those_girls_who_has_been_with_husbands/c12z61l) said.

* The 'free spirit' thing seems to have riled a few people up. I simply meant that I thought *they* thought I was a free spirit. I sort of hate the term and don't think I fit in to that airy fairy stereotype. But I am free in that I have few commitments and have a (common, I know) open-minded approach to sex and relationships.

* As for open relationships, one of the husbands I mentioned below was in a don't-ask-don't-tell type open relationship which seemed to work for them. So in that case I wasn't 'hurting' the wife or taking part in any deceit, but I included him in the text below because I think him being married was probably part of the attraction for me.

* I don't actively pursue taken men. I work in a male-dominated industry so am surrounded by men all day every day.  Some of them have SOs, some don't. Some of them hit on me, some of them don't. Some of them I'm attracted to, some I'm not.  I have been involved with far more single men than taken men.

* Most importantly, and as a continuation from the above point, I didn't start my conversations with the taken men I was with with the intention of sleeping with them. In all cases they were the ones who initially came on to me. It doesn't absolve me of **any** guilt, and I still feel shitty for following through and not turning them away, I just want to clarify that in all the cases these were men who were actively seeking to cheat.

I have a terrible history of having flings/relationships with people who are otherwise 'taken'.  I'm ashamed of it and it's something I want to change, but I also think I must have some subconscious reasons for doing it. 

Some back-story: I don't have self-esteem problems, and I know I can be a good girlfriend - I'm loving, laid back, not jealous, and generally fun. BUT, I haven't been in a relationship in nearly 3 years, and in that time I've had some sort of illicit relationship with 2 husbands and 2 boyfriends, and had several of both come on to me (but thankfully I either wasn't attracted to them or I had the sense to decline).  

The farthest I've gotten in my introspection and understanding of the situation is that maybe I want intimacy but no risk of anything long term. And yet, I would LOVE to be in a relationship and after recovering from an emotionally abusive partner (above-mentioned relationship 3yrs ago) I feel like I'd be ready for it.  Also, I suspect that I come across to these men as a 'free spirit' - enjoys sex and good conversation and good company... but then I guess I probably put across that impression.

So, what do I do?

This past weekend, I was doing my regular weekly shopping at ""Blue Store Mart"" & my husband sends me a text asking if I would grab him a pack of cigs while I was out. I was with my 4 year old & I'm also 5 months pregnant. Lucky me, I'm super tiny so I look about 15 months pregnant. 

I go up to the checkout & ask for the cigs he wanted, and some guy who was kind of lingering around the checkout, maybe he was going to cover the lady's break or something idk, swoops in & snatches the pack out of the womans hand.

 He turns to me & goes "" what are you doing young lady? You can't buy these!"" He said it in a way like he was joking, but not, at the same time. And I said ""what??""

And I said ""it doesn't really matter because legally I CAN buy them, but they aren't for me. They're for my husband"" 

And this mother F'er turns to my 4 year old son & goes ""is that true? Does mommy use these?"" And showed him the pack. My son doesn't like strangers very often and he definitely doesn't take well to people who are being shitty to me, so he told him to shut up.

It‚Äôs a more subtle form of emotional abuse; but those who have lived through narcissism know it well. Your achievements are either discredited and dismissed or flipped in a way that the narcissist can take credit for them.

I learned reading that thread that marathon proposals are becoming a bit of a thing. Because of how AFAB people are socialized, we may dismiss it and feel happy in the moment to welcome those we love into our achievement. Women‚Äôs achievements, especially physical ones are constantly downplayed and undermined.

Midwest US/40's. 100% pre-everything, deep clotherI am pretty sure am (supposed to be) a woman. I think I have known since 8 or 9. Mostly repressed, but dressed on an off over years. Even after married, now divorced, but kinda dating. Even after kids. (Pretty sure just me ""Trying to be a man."" Regardless, I genuinely love, care and will put their needs before mine.)

I generally have superior ""repress it"" game. But, when using a certain controlled substance (not regularly, but am at the moment), all of my inhibitions and repressing that part are lifted. I love it, but I confused AF. I feel terrified and elated at the same time. I am not entirely sure what scares me. But I feel so satisfied and delighted with how I feel. More and more when letting her out, I find I am thinking of myself as she/her/girl/etc. 

Wearing (but societal gender norms) women's clothing, falsies, wig, etc feels so natural to wear. (Yeh, wigs are hot and horrible.) Emotionally, I feel at ease, content relaxed. While I do love wearing a bra and other ""reviled"" items, I have totally learned why so many Facebook posts about taking it off immediately after work. 

At least insomuch as my current body allows for, I have taken on the female sexual role a few times. From the first time, sex right. Physically and emotionally it was like I found what I was missing. I do not know how else to describe it, other than ""sublime"".

Lurking in this sub, and just from observing in general, life as a woman is full of challenges, difficulty and danger. (Over simplifying and generalizing for brevity.) But, when I honestly think about it, knowing all of that, I am still certain I truly and desire nothing more than physically present and be female.

1657912407.0,Being a woman in the gym is so exhausting.,"I (22f) was going about my business in the gym today, training upper body. I was doing a heavy seated overhead press, just 4 rep sets. As I‚Äôm doing a set, I can feel eyes on me. After I finish, I turn toward my head toward the guy bench pressing next to me and confirm that he was watching me. We make eye contact and he takes his headphones out to talk to me. 

He proceeds to tell me (in a prescriptive, not just suggestive way) not to lock my elbows at the top of the rep or I‚Äôm going to hurt myself. I was so pissed off I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to respond with anything more than a slight nod. I sort of wish I had spoken up to defend myself, but I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene. 

I have two problems with what he did. 

1) he‚Äôs literally wrong. Locking out at the top of an overhead press is perfectly safe and makes sense when doing heavy, low reps because you‚Äôre resting instead of sitting under constant load. It‚Äôs not a question of proper form but of style/variation. 

2) even if I had been performing the lift incorrectly, why say anything? Were you really afraid I‚Äôd hurt myself and trying to save me from injury? Or do you need to assert your superiority over women in the gym? I see people lifting with incorrect form constantly and have never approached anyone with unsolicited advice because it‚Äôs just that‚Äîunsolicited. If I wanted help I would ask. Everyone is responsible for his or her own safety in the gym and if I wanted a trainer I‚Äôd hire one. 

I‚Äôve been lifting for 5 years and just wondering at what point men are going to stop feeling free to provide their commentary on my form.

I went through the process to be called by my chosen name in the test (i had to use my legal name in the test itself, but i would not be deadnamed by staff, it still caused mayor confusion, ugh). So my university saw that and decided to put me by my chosen name in the university website (including emails and everything). Aka no one knew my deadname and i was seen as male, it caused a lot of trouble, but that's for later. Aka i was stealth trans by accident and i took the opportunity (only outting myself to a classmate that ended up leaving as well).

Ok so everyone thinks i'm a cis guy just with a stupidly high pitched voice, well... we usually have to be separated into groups through zoom, and we were doing a specific trigonometry problem and this guy is explaining something wrong and doing the problem ""his way"", and i tell him that if we did it like the proffesor told us to it would give us a different result and we should do it that way, he then interrupted me and told me ""do you EVEN know trigonometry?"" And mansplained me the whole ass process, that same guy misgendered me several times and also mansplained me on several group meetings, yet everyone (even girls)   only sais good things about him, it looked just like it was just like that to me.

Longtime lurker who is looking for some insight. I work in a hospital and have seen many, many things- both amazing and horrifying. This past weekend I was having a discussion with my friend and she mentioned that an old college friend of ours had an abortion and because of it, her fiance left her. 

This started a discussion into abortion rights, and she said the fiance had every right to leave her; apparently they had talked about this when they first started dating and he told her, for religious reasons, he would never be ok with an abortion, and she said she was ok with that. I said that if he really loved her, he wouldn't make her go through a pregnancy she didn't want- that he was choosing his religious views over his love for her.

My friend got upset and starting throwing out examples of where ""her body, her choice"" might be a ""grey area"" and the one that stuck out was the one in the title. Although I am against the thought of forcing or preventing someone from getting an abortion- the thought that the victim would have no say in this child and could potentially be further victimized knowing that his rapist is raising his child...I don't know I feel.

Because I'm a lady, I have a much smaller chance of ever getting tazed, stun-gunned, pepper sprayed or even shot at in self defense.  

I mean in a perfect world, non-rapey and non-violent men would also have a low chance, but even a 'nice' man can look threatening when walking behind a woman at night, even if he never meant to intimidate her at all.  And one wrong move, or walking to fast, or saying anything that could be misconstrued is a good way to make an already jumpy woman whip out a pocket mace or stun gun (I've held my stun gun in my pocket walking alone before)

Just an observation.  And as much as I don't like being treated worse than men in some situations, I do sometimes enjoy the sparce benefits of sexism.  I'm never seen as a threat, and while I could be shot or tazed for other reasons, self defense is probably not one of them.  And thank god for that!",TwoXChromosomes

I feel so fucking stupid because I knew he was into this and we talked about it before.

I'm sorry, this is a bit of a rant.

I (23 F) live on a closed base (U.S.) that has it's own beach. I feel safe enough to take my dog on daily walks on the beach. She likes to chase crabs and I'm trying to get her to be better about not pulling, so most of my attention is usually on leash training her.

I pass by a bunch of random people, most say hi or keep to themselves. I'm keeping an eye on my dog. Then I see these three bigger guys. I'm not paying a lot of attention to them. I'm keeping a good grip on my dog and am focused on her, when I hear these guys talking extremely loud. I can't make out what they're saying and I sort of glance back, they're all looking at me. When I do that one of them yells ""yeah that's right, I saw that."" I keep walking because I honestly don't know if they're just loud speakers and talking to one another. Maybe they were talking in the context of seeing a new show or something?

I get off the beach and am on the sidewalk back to my home. Suddenly a car rushes by me going at least 45 mph (it's 25 mph on this base), and they lay on their horn. There's another car tailgating them too. I realize it's the three guys in two separate cars. They all stare at me. They go by so fast I can't do anything. I can't even flip them off.

I'm just so mad I can't even take my dog for a walk without something like this happening. I'm a plain person and I don't try to draw attention to myself (although even if I wasn't plain, that's no right to treat people like this). Yet people like this treat me like I can't even feel comfortable in my own neighborhood. I'm just frustrated. I was so scared about moving to this area. We live on this base because I'm so paranoid and wanted to live somewhere with a lot of security, and I hate that I have to do that. I hate that I do that and can't even get away from boys who think harassing a person who's just minding their own business is funny.

I live in the Middle East and there are clothing rules and expectations which I equally despise. Would I be subjected to the same hatred and downvotes if my post was only about the Middle East not letting me wear what I want to? I dont think so.

OP:
Everyone seems to know whats best for us. Be it Saudi Arabia who wants us to wear something or France who doesnt want us to wear something. 

No one treats us as smart individuals who can make the best decision for OURSELVES. Our decision is only valued when it fits the criteria for what they deem acceptable for us to wear. Otherwise, people just have a stereotype of weak, uneducated women who are forced to live based on the whims of men. This maybe true for many Muslim women in many countries but is definitely not true for a vast population of Muslim women who are educated, smart and successful. Like most women around world, I do happen to have the mental capacity to make the decision about what clothes I want to wear. 

I really couldn't less about some people on reddit sitting far away on a computer who have no perspective into our lives and struggles but know everything about how we should be living based on their few stereotypes.

Not everyone who wears anything different from Western society is being coerced into it. After all, who decides that a t-shirt and jean is acceptable casual attire and a suit is acceptable formal attire etc? What if hair was being covered until now like our genitals? At the end of the day it is an arbitrary sytem which people take pride in forcing upon us.

One can argue that people who choose to cover their hair or wear loose clothing are under peer pressure or do so because of society. But its not just that. It can be cultural, it can be a part of our identity and it can be religous. Does it really matter why we do it as long as no one forced us? If you really feel that it represents the wrong ideals, then continue to give us the opportunty to educate ourselves and make our own choices (but accept them even if they are not the same as what you think is suitable). Help us by giving us jobs based on merit and not discriminating against our clothing in the workplace. It is true that in many countries (definitely not in France) Muslim women are in bad conditions but this is because of their dependence on men. They cannot leave even if they want to because they are not educated or independant. If someone is indeed being coerced into things, clothing or otherwise, then we have to give them the independance to leave the situation through equal opportunities in terms of education and work. What you shouldn't do is make this choice for us. That is not how change happens. All that does is isolates women further from society and make them feel like they and their choice dont belong there. 

Lets take the example of the burkin ban. Before, women were going to the beach with their kids and they both were exposed to French culture and ideals. It might be late for the women, but the kids especially might have had the chance to integrate further into French society. Do you know what happens after the ban? They will stay at home. Both the women and children will continue to spend time with only those people who share the same ideas as themselves and further reinforce them.

Banning of face coverings might be acceptable because of security reasons but it should stop right there. There are people fighting for female nudity to be acceptable just like it is for men which I fully agree with. Similarily, it is my right as an individual to cover myself as I want to as long as I am not harming anyone and i am fed up of people telling me otherwise. Lets not forget, feminism is about giving women the choice, it is not about deciding whats best for them.

EDIT:
This post has drawn some very strong responses so let me address some points here,

1. Stop telling me to live in Saudi Arabia. This post is not about Western countries only. It is as much about Muslim countries who are telling me what to wear, much more then the West is. Often, other Muslim women can be our biggest critic. I wear tight clothes and hijab, which means I am judged everywhere. In the future, maybe I decide not to wear something and I should have the right to do so as well.

2. It is sad to see many people justifying their ideas by mentioning that the same happens in Muslim countries to them. These countries are not 'free' societies. Why would you give up your great values of freedom to be like them. Do you really want to take lessons from Saudi Arabia now on how to deal with women clothing?

3. I fully support your right to dress how you want as an individual so stop saying 'If your country supported ___ , I would support you in ___'. I dont have a voice in these countries, this is why I have always wanted to move to a Western country because of their values when it comes to women rights and freedom of expression. However, I am saddened to see what is happening right now. That is all.

4. A lot of people are saying we can't know if Hijab is forced or not. There are many things which are a crime if forced. Forced sex being an example. Doesnt mean we go ahead and ban sex.

5. Stop assuming I live in France. I am not French and the burkini ban personally doesnt affect me. We are all free to boice our opinions though, arent we? Dont you voice your opinion about women rights in Muslim countries? So, why can't I? There are many Muslim French citizens who don't have any other place to call home and it is unfair to them.

6. This is not just a problem unique to me. This is a women struggle around the world. We have much higher beauty standards to conform to then men. Our appearance and what we wear is often given more importance then any other characteristic that we possess.

7. Thank you for all the messages telling me to not bother with TwoX. I have realised the same.

I know the recent Texas abortion ban is being talked about quite a bit online, but what often gets left behind is that transgender, intersex and non-binary individuals can have and need abortions, and there's often times quite a big barrier to access considering that many abortion clinics don't want trans, non-binary, and intersex people (not that all of these groups are even the same, just that there's a lot of overlap) in their clinics, don't take the time to understand our treatments and/or medical conditions, and even if the providers do ""accept"" us into their clinics, there's a lot of misgendering, disrespect, and inappropriate questions asked. I have a friend who is a trans man that I went to college with and needed family planning but it was difficult because there was only one clinic in the entire city that would accept him (and one of few in the entire state that would accept him) . Even then, there was a lot of disrespect of who he was as a person from the doctors.

Because of this, I believe that not only do we need to be opposed to these abortion bans but talk about how it impacts trans, non-binary, and intersex people as well and try to get the language changed from ""woman's right to choose"" but to ""people's rights to choose."" Apart from the doctors and providers in clinics not wanting to see people like us often times, I can imagine that this cis-gendered oriented language can be exclusionary and alienating at times and makes it hard for a lot of people to want to put their support behind this cause, and I don't blame them. But I do believe the consequences are dire if we don't speak up for the rights of people, regardless of their gender identity to have control over their own bodies, as this opens up more avenues for exploitation of our bodies, harassment, and other unethical things to occur.

**And the most daming thing of all is that this abortion ban is going to affect poor individuals and people of color the most, in addition to the other identities we have!**

Addendum: Feel free to contact your local Planned Parenthood and volunteer (various chapters in different states have had trans men talk about their abortion experiences before, and advocate for more inclusive language).

I would exercise compulsively and it took a toll on my physical and emotional health.  I've been doing really well for the last two years, found a great therapist and supports and feel like I'm healing.  I used to be an athlete before my eating disorder and I missed working out.  I worked with my therapist and she suggested I find a gym with group exercises classes because they would have a defined start and end time with some guidance and that structure would be helpful.  I found a gym with some great classes and with one great instructor in particular.  I was really enjoying her classes until about three months ago I noticed she would say things about how many calories we were burning in the class and how that translated into how much food we could eat.  It was really triggering for me and, after talking with my therapist, I decided not to take her classes anymore.  I was also feeling well enough to start exercising on my own.
Last week, my gym sent an email with a survey asking for evaluations of the group exercise classes and the instructors.  I assumed it was anonymous and wrote a glowing review of the classes and of the instructor.  I also said that I found her comments hard to hear and that it could be triggering for someone in recovery and she might want change how she talked about calories burned.  
A day later, I was working out and I saw the instructor on a treadmill and I felt like she was giving me dirty looks.  When I got home, I had an email from the gym manager asking for a sit down meeting between me, the manager and the instructor to talk about my comments and it said that they may need a note from my doctor verofying that my health is good enough for me to continue working out with them.
I'm so confused and I'm not sure what to do.  I can't speak with my therapist until Thursday.  I didn't mean the comments to get her in trouble, just to make her aware.

*Four years before the murders, I was sitting in a bar in Washington, D.C. with a male friend. Another young woman was alone at the bar when an older man scooted next to her. He was aggressive, wasted, and sitting too close, but she smiled curtly at his ramblings and laughed softly at his jokes as she patiently downed her drink. ‚ÄúWhy is she humoring him?‚Äù my friend asked me. ‚ÄúYou would never do that.‚Äù I was too embarrassed to say: ‚ÄúBecause he looks scary‚Äù and ‚ÄúI do it all the time.‚Äù*

I mentioned this to my fiance, who told me that this is why she says ""hi"" to the creepy neighbor who always says ""hi."" I was floored. I had no idea women did this. It completely surprised me. 

Today, I mentioned the article at work to some of my female colleagues. When I mentioned that section of the article, they all agreed that, at some point or another, they had done something similar. Again, I was shocked. 

Honestly, until this article, I thought something similar to the author's guy friend. I thought that, in any public place, such as a bar, if a guy was annoying the girl, she'd tell him to go 'f off'. I can think of countless times that I've encountered this same scenario and did nothing because I had no idea that the guy I thought was a jerk was scary to the woman. 

Anyway, this completely blew my mind and I didn't see a thread already on this topic, so I thought I'd share. And, I'd love to hear more about similar scenarios, if Reddit knows of any.

Edit: Wow. Thank you Reddit. Most of the comments here have been very insightful. I was not aware of this before the article. I guess if there's anything to get out of this, it is to spread the word because I'm betting I'm not the only guy who didn't know, but would like to. Thanks!

1379360849.0,We need a charity that pays at risk teenage girls to take long term injectable contraceptives.,"In a teenage pregnancy, there are two main victims: The mother and the child. The child did not choose to be born to a teenage girl. And in at least 80% of cases, the mother did not choose to become pregnant. Just providing contraceptives is not going to solve the problem, as [48% of pregnancies are caused by failed contraceptives.](http://www.arhp.org/publications-and-resources/contraception-journal/january-2008)

Unfortunately, despite the fact that 80% of teenage pregnancies are unintended, the vast majority of pregnant teenage girls choose not to abort. [Among teenage girls, only 2% of pregnancies end in abortion.](http://www.data360.org/graph_group.aspx?Graph_Group_Id=290)

We will forever face the problem that abortion carries a stigma. Women are ashamed of abortions, and many consider it a traumatic experience.

Luckily, a good solution is available, in the form of injectable contraceptives: Depo Provera. Injectable contraceptives are the only truly reliable form of contraception. [Compared to injectable contraceptives, the risk of unplanned pregnancies in sexually active women using other forms of contraceptives is 22-fold higher.](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1110855)

Important to note is that injectable contraceptives are much cheaper in the long term than other forms of contraception. [A program in Iowa that gave teenage girls injectable contraceptives managed to save 17.23 dollar in public spending for every dollar spent on contraceptives.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_acting_reversible_contraceptive#Cost)

My suggestion therefore is that our society needs a non-profit organization that aims to encourage teenage girls at risk of teen pregnancy to take injectable contracpetives. Ideally, the girls would receive a substantial financial reward every time they show up to receive the injection. The program should be aimed at those girls most at risk of pregnancy, namely, those from disadvantaged communities.

I hope all of you will take my thoughts into consideration. Anyone who is professionally active in family planning should consider adopting this idea and preventing a lot of unnecessary suffering.

I marred a wonderful woman at a young age and have 2 children a son and a daughter.   not that partying or drinking etc is bad ...I am just saying, I missed out on many of the social situations where I probably would have seen some ugly behavior.

I knew that women experienced sexual harassment or assault.  I hadn't witnessed it.  I hadnt participated in it, and it never happened to me as man.  I think before the #metoo movement I just hadn't really noticed how unfairly women are treated.  Its hard to imagine that nearly everyone you know has endured these awful situations ...and you just never understood what they were going through.  I just didnt see it.

I see it in my daughters life though.

My 11 year old daughter has been in Junior high for 8 weeks.  In that time she came to realize that boys could and would call her really sexualized things.  In tears she told me that there is nothing that can be done about it.

Not trying to be graphic but one boy calls her ""Slut"" and ""Titties"" and ""Ho"".

She told him to stop.  She told her teachers.  She told me.  She told her guidance Councillor.

and that's when I noticed that nobody outside of me, was going to do anything to put a stop to it.

&#x200B;

At Parent teacher interviews I was told that my daughter had to grow a thicker skin.  The boy was spoken to in the hallway.  It doesn't stop - and worse there really didn't seem to be any mechanism that the adults were going to do something to make it stop.

My daughter did everything in her 11 year old power to stop this ...and she couldn't.  It just breaks my Dad heart.

&#x200B;

So today I went with my 11 year old girl to talk to the principal and to the local police about stopping her pervasive sexual harassment problem.  I told them we will press charges.  I told them we expect the school to protect her, and if they do not that I am willing to bring civil action against them.

Suddenly now there is this whole mechanism at work ready to tell a 12 year old boy he cant sexually harass his classmates....  They are suspending him,  he is facing youth criminal charges, he will have a protection order.

but today I am just sad - why wasn't her standing up for herself good enough to put those tools for handling this boy in play?

Or is this something women just have to accept and its normal ...I just didn't notice it?  Is this a hopeless a fight for her?  As a Dad I want to do the right thing ...I just dont know what it is.

Thank you for the comments and PM's.  

&#x200B;

After a full nights sleep I am still struck by how difficult it is to recognize the situation when you are inside it.

&#x200B;

I think what has my attention is that I am a 43 y/o  man, of some means ...and I am unsure how to step.  How are our girls supposed to deal with this?  Why should they have to?

After a full nights sleep I have decided that I can do more in my little corner of earth to make this better.   I think I have the influence to change the school policy if I push. I think the school board should be updating the school policy of student sexual harassment.  The current policy freezes the punishment to classroom level teacher intervention unless the student or her parents go to the principal.  I think that is garbage.  A victim coming to an adult, her teacher ...it should be enough.

&#x200B;

I would like to see the teachers involve the schools powers to correct behavior right away, not on ""strike 5"".

&#x200B;

To me the process should be , once a teacher identifies the situation.

&#x200B;

1) Speak to the offending child one on one.  Teach him that his behaviour isn't just wrong, its illegal.  Let the student know that his behaviour must immediatly correct.  Inform him that IF he repeats this behavior the school policy is to refer him to the Principal and school resource police officer for supplemental dicipline.

&#x200B;

2) On the SECOND occurrence.  The student should meet with the principal.  Again be reminded that this is a crime.  Have his parents contacted and have him meet with the school resource officer to inform him of the charges he could face.  In the current policy he would face an in school suspension.  I think at this stage the student has been fairly warned, the parents have been fairly warned that his behavior MUST correct.

&#x200B;

3) On the 3rd confirmed instance of school sexual harassment the boy should be charged.  where I live those charges come with a mandatory protection order with the victim - which means the offender must be removed from that class and ordered to have no direct or indirect contact with the victim.  Also I live in Canada....there is a little cultural difference with Americans with regards to charges.    Charging a youth with a crime is serious, but its not like the punitive system in the states.  He wouldn't be Brendan Dassay, he would have court ordered consequences like community service and probably some mandatory education on the impact of harassment.  In Canada young offenders criminal record is wiped clean when they become an adult.  I have seen our justice system work on crimes like this,  It does get a families attention when they have to go in front of a judge.

The school has this power - it just doesn't use it.  I suspect that we would hardly ever make it to step 3 if they were firm from the beginning.

My daughter has reported this behavior, officially to her school at least 6 times ""on the record"" before we finally got to this point.  I feel that is way way too many times to expect the girl to deal with this problem before the strength of real consequences for this crime fall on the perpetrator.

Her school is grade 7 to 12.  The older girls in school are sympathetic but they sincerely believe nothing can be done to change it in their school.

The adults are failing them...and that includes me.

i guess its my fight to deal with ...maybe just because I can, and somebody should.

How can you possibly think that the gender who is dealing with rights being constantly granted and stripped away all over the world has more privilege than you? If it was the fucking early 70s right now I wouldn't have a credit card. If I was in fucking Afghanistan right now my life would be completely dominated by men. If I was in Texas right now I couldn't have an abortion. HOW CAN MEN ARGUE THAT THEY'RE MORE OPPRESSED? They have never had to face anything like this. They have never faced broad decisions being made for ALL of them by women in charge.

The ""men's rights"" they advocate for are rules that men who have taken turns being in power for centuries have decided for BOTH men and women. They act like women decided they should be primary caregivers. They act like women decided the ""women and children first"" rule (side note it cracks me up that they think this happens all the time outside of in Titanic). Even so, maybe the perceived oppression of ""women and children first"" is because men are physically stronger than women - how is this AN ADVANTAGE FOR WOMEN??? How is it an advantage to be physically weaker?

They truly believe they have been oppressed based on their gender when MEN are the only group who have never been oppressed solely based on the fact that they're men. Men who are a part of marginalized groups don't count, of course.

It's clear that it's about hating women. It makes me physically sick how delusional it is. The internet really needs to stop with this ""men are more oppressed than women"" thing. It's extremely dangerous and I'm really trying to understand it but they make it difficult when they blatantly hate women and make their own problems for themselves.

They have the exact same attitude as their ancestors who decided what our female ancestors were allowed to and not allowed to do - they just project it differently by trying to make up this attack of men's rights (is this not an oxymoron?) that isn't happening.

Men's rights are not under attack and this needs to stop.

I just bought a bottle of nair sensitive for the bikini area to, you know, make the fallopian flower smoother than a dewey rose petal. I read the instructions on how to apply and it says it CAN be used on bikini area, but NOT in vaginal. Ok. I'm thinking as long as I dont physically insert into any holes we should be fine, right? 

Wrong. I smoothed on the cream as instructed and waited the time, taking a shower and washing my hair while the time passes.  When it's been six minutes I start to wash it off and at first I am quite impressed at the amount of hair that's coming off. It's starting to burn a little as I wash but nothing to crazy.  About this time the urge to pee hits me in the shower like it often does and I did what I normally do and let it loose. 

The fire that instantly consumed my nethers was enough to cause me to crumple to the floor of the shower in utter agony.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?  I just absolutely have no words.  I normally don't get this upset, not even at the catcalling (hence the mostly sarcastic FB post) but I just cannot believe a friend of mine would comment something so outstandingly crude and demeaning.  Needless to say he's deleted, my only regret is that I didn't continue calling him out publicly while he could still see the status.

Ugh.  A great fucking start to the week.

Edit: Formatting

Edit 2: For clarification.  I wasn't ENRAGED by the guy telling me I had nice legs.  I'm more upset about the fact that I posted in a place (my FB) where I thought I could get support and instead got my perspective and experience even further belittled.  For people saying that I'm over-reacting to a ""compliment"" and that they'd be happy to get that same kind of attention, good for you.  I'm happy for you.  But in my world, and in my experience, being cat called is NOT a compliment, and the people catcalling are not doing it to be flatterers.  They are doing it to make sure that I, the receiver, know that I'm not entitled to mind my own business and that I'm on constant display and deserve to be judged based on my physical and sexual characteristics.",TwoXChromosomes
1326480779.0,I wish I could be a housewife,"Am I the only one who feels like this. I wish so badly I could be a housewife. To look after a family. To sew things and take my kids out to see the world and teach them things, to keep the house nice and clean instead of a tip, to cook real food instead of stuff out of boxes.

I really resent the fact that that possibility has been taken away from me. I don't really hate feminists, I know that it's only half their fault (and the rest is on capitalism), but I do get angry about it especially when rich feminists with media influence get to say on tv and in magazines that it's all about ""choice"" when in the real world there is no choice. Two incomes = two worker slaves, two incomes = two tax payers, two incomes = the capacity to raise prices to compensate for the ubiquity of two income families. Then suddenly there is no choice, we all have to slave away for faceless corporations we don't care about when before we could have been at home working for human beings we do care about.

What gets to me about it all was that... maybe freedom is a great idea, but freedom was never on the table, it never was, not for most people. It was just a choice between slaveries and I honestly prefer the idea of putting my life energies, my heart and soul, into helping the people I love, not into helping some inhuman institution further rape the planet in the name of profit.

It depresses me so much. And people look at me like I am crazy, and I am made to feel guilty for not wanting to ""do my part"" (of labour outside of the home to earn an income)... well dammit I will do it ok! I know I have to, I know we need the damn money! But I can never pretend I want to or I like it. I honestly feel in some ways (and again I reiterate capitalism is more to blame) that feminism ruined my life.

I am slightly chubby all over, but you mostly see it in my hips and very big thighs.

Other than the chub factor, I'd say I'm average to above average in other categories.  I'm smart (I know a lot about science, I go to art museums regularly, I love David Foster Wallace, I do the New York Times crossword puzzle every day).  I'm funny (A grasshopper walks into a bar, the bartender says ""Hey, we gotta drink named after you.""  The grasshopper is stunned, ""You have a drink named Fred?"").  I'm fun (I throw great cocktail parties) and am sophisticated (I love fashion and know about wine and good restaurants) without being a snob (I also love sports and eating peanut butter out of the jar).  I could go on and on.  

I can manage to get some dates, but not often, and when it goes beyond more than a few dates I can usually tell within 6 weeks to 3 months that things just aren't going anywhere. (This is due to my keen detections of such subtle red flags as saying ""I'm not up for something serious right now,"" showing up later and later to each date and acting annoyed that I'm irritated if they are 2 hours late, making me feel like I have to beg for sex, refusing to tell friends and family I exist, treating me like I am a distant acquaintance in public, etc.)

- Traditional flirtation and coquettishness     
- Non-traditional flirtation and making the first move     
- Being super ""sex positive""     
- ""Saving"" sex for later     
- Dating in my ""league""      
- Dating out of my ""league""  
- Online dating
- Offline dating

women's average optimal temperature is actually 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees C). this is because of differences in body size and fat to muscle ratios. 

it makes me mad how MUCH the world is just made for men without any consideration for women. and they don't even bother updating shit as time goes by.

edit: oh oh btw this temperature is also best suited for men who would wear suits to work! women, on the other hand, have always had a variety of clothes to wear - with dresses often being a common choice. this is why women have to have a designated office sweater or freeze to death.

new edit: wanna add that these optimal temperatures are based on averages. as many of you have pointed out, temperatures are a very individual thing - but by and large it would seem that women needed a slightly warmer temperature than men. 

some studies talk about productivity and temperatures and [this article](https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-office-temperature-women-men-study-20190529-story.html) talks about a range between 70 and 80 being best for women and below 70 for men. they concluded by saying temperatures should be changed on the basis of the people in that space, and provide facilities for those that get too warm or too cold. they say mid 70s might be a good temperature to set. 

my post was not meant to say that this is the optimal temperature for all women or all men. my point is that temperatures are still set by men's preferences, not women's. this is another example of how we just have to adjust ourselves because we live in a man's world.",TwoXChromosomes
1618637312.0,Men have trained women to compete with each other for their approval and i am OVER IT,"This winter I learned to downhill ski with a group of male friends. A couple of them are skilled skiers, so they taught me a lot, which I appreciate. After several sessions I was gaining confidence and wanting to spend more time practicing on my own. I tried to ask my friends to back off with the coaching because it wasn't helping my learning. This became an issue with my boyfriend (now ex) who continued to override my request by giving me constant feedback. We are good friends still and I wanted to ski with him and our other mutual male friends but I became so self conscious about my skiing abilities because I was always worried about him judging and critiquing me. It sucked because I started to like skiing a lot and I also thought that I had made a ton of progress throughout the season, yet I feel discouraged from skiing now because I know he doesn't think I'm very good. 

Before I go any further, yes we can all conclude that he is acting like a sexist asshole and I shouldn't care about his approval! I should ski because I like it for myself and I should be proud of how much I've learned.

But we all know it isn't that simple to just cast off the patriarchy.

Recently my ex introduced a woman, we'll call her Amy, to the friend group. She is awesome and I want to be friends with her. My ex and another male in the group took Amy skiing for the first time today and she crushed it. I am happy for her, but admittedly jealous. It did not come that easily to me. I felt guilty for comparing myself to her and not being as happy for her as I should be. We women should be lifting each other up, no exceptions. But as I thought about it more, I realized I'm not jealous of her because she is learning faster than I did; I am jealous because she gained my ex's approval and praise INSTANTLY, whereas I still basically do not have it. 

So it's bad enough that my standards of success for myself are based off of my male friends' approval, but what's so much more fucked up is that men have essentially PITTED us women against each other to VIE for their approval; we've been doing it for centuries and WE'RE STILL DOING IT. It is disgusting and I hate it, and I hate that I perpetuate this patriarchally-crafted toxic bullshit.

Long story short: Most of our friend group have known each other since high school or earlier. Whether we hung out in high school or not, we eventually gravitated to the same parties and ended up all forming a pretty tight knit bond. It was becoming more and more apparent that the Dudebros of the group (because they made up most of the ""OG Group"") thought that they ran the show. Decided when there would be hang outs, what we would be doing, who's house we'd be drinking at and what video games we (the ""girlfriends"" even though more than half of the dubbed ""girlfriends"" were part of the OG crew) would be playing/ watching be played. 

Tonight was the first official ceremony of the Mystery Club. All of the ladies of the crew have been facebook grouped into a club/gang of ladies who, starting tonight, have created a Sash with badges for each ""Mystery Event"" we host to be passed on to the next hostess in the beginning ceremony of each event. We have bandannas that will be worn at all times and be sure to be visible during any get together Mystery or otherwise. 

I can honestly say that these Mystery Events (named so because us ladies need to have our mystery from our SO counterparts if only to keep something for ourselves) are the highlight of my week/month. We just come up with a theme or activity that we will do that day/night and get together for hours and chat and drink and be silly without judgement. With all of our busy schedules I am amazed that we can do this at all. But somehow we find a way to set aside time to make an appearance, at least, and enjoy the camaraderie. We share ideas, tell embarrassing stories (that we all find out we share in some way anyway), get advice..... I'm sure this is normal stuff to some ladies, but to me... this is new. I am absolutely on top of the world just knowing I have these ladies' backs and they have mine. 

TL;DR My ladies and I have a club who get together often and I couldn't feel more on top of the world knowing that I have this solid group of ladies who all have eachother's backs. We might be adults, but as a group, I've never felt more alive. I've never felt more open. I've never enjoyed other's company as I do with this awesome group of ladies.

Almost everytime we say we're fighting for equality, they bring in this argument of how women have contributed to nothing in this world (When they have never even allowed us to exist as individuals. We were only allowed to exist as their properties) OR

How women are physically weaker than them so they need men for ""pRoTecTiOn"" (From who? Other men?? If you'd find it in your heart to just let us be and leave us alone, it would help us greatly in staying safe) OR

I honestly think that it's absolutely pathetic that their only arguments in favour of them being above us is that they're physically stronger than us and that they carry the sperm necessary for procreation.

If we go down that road wouldn't this point hold the same weight as if we said ""We're the ones carrying, birthing and rearing children, since all of your are incapable of doing so, you will always be beneath us"".

I also don't disagree with the fact that the phrase ""white feminism"" has been coined as a negative term to attribute to white women who have created their own exclusive brand of feminism that further disenfranchises non-whites is appropriate; it's real issue that sabotages ALL women, both those who are excluded and those who are doing the excluding.

I'm not sure how widespread or known the important benefits of breastfeeding is. Most studies find at least IQ gains of 3 points over formula or other solutions.  Also the length of time to breast feed a baby is likely much longer than 6 months and should instead be about 3 years.  

It's sad to see breast feeding have such a stigma especially even at 12 months of age. Studies have shown the enormous benefit of breast feeding and it's effect on brain development and immune system development.  It's also important to note that the nutritional and other health of the mother is very important in this time as well (vitamins, foods, etc).  

It would be very beneficial to the breastfeeding in public and avoiding shame for breast feeding 1-2 year olds if this was more well known by everyone in society.

---

So a quick outline of my ""problems"" because they're not the point, and I don't really want to talk about them on the internet, but they are relevant to my story:

I have a long history of depression in my family, and long history of depression personally. I started feeling quite unhappy and overly stressed about six months ago. After it had stuck  around for a few months I told my SO, who I've been with for several years. He said some supportive things, it was nice. About a month later he started being a massive asshole and I had a breakdown at a social event, and he acted surprised because he thought I had ""gotten better"".

I explained to him that you don't just ""get better"", but then we started having some relationship problems. Partially because he started becoming a bit controlling and I'm a bit of a free spirit, and partially because he's very emotionally needy and he says ""I love you"" a LOT, but my emotional state is kind of fucked up and I'm having trouble feeling the smallest bit of warmth for my mother and my dog, let alone someone who tried to stop me going out with my friends because ""only sluts go out clubbing"", and made me get changed out of a catwoman costume for a party we were going to because he didn't like other people seeing me in it. Someone who I've had to explain why there is actually a relevant discussion on topics like Feminism, MRAs and #YesAllWomen

Let's just say that I never thought that I would have to explain those things to someone I'm this close to, and I'm equally stunned that it hadn't come up sooner. I have explained why all of those things made me angry and hurt however, and he seems to be getting it.

Those issues are not my point though, I realized through all of this that because of my emotional state, my preferred relationship would be one where I could just have great sex with someone who is essentially just a good friend (in my mind this is my current SO), fall asleep next to a nice warm man, wake up in a nice warm bed, and get up and go about my own damn day without having to worry about someone else's feelings. I'm feeling emotionally smothered, and I kind of just need to deal with my own issues at the moment. 

---

So I wanted to tell a few of my close friends about how I've been not coping very well to make a kind of support network, as that has worked for me before, and oddly enough I'm actually a pretty positive and bubbly person, so I know my friends need to hear me say it before they realize anything is wrong.

I told a couple of female friends and they have been great, but they're all really busy or live hours away from me, and I have a pretty even male to female ratio of friends, so I told one of my close male friends (not the one I referred to in the title), and for some reason he focused on, and asked a lot of questions about, my preferred relationship idea thing. I thought it was weird, but he's kind of flirty with absolutely everyone, and he was very supportive as he's dealt with this in his own family before, so I kind of just went with it.

I then asked another close male friend of mine over for drinks, as I've done many times before with no problem, and explained everything to him. Again, he focused a lot on the sex thing, asking a lot of questions, etc. I was a bit weirded out again, but I kept talking until I'd said everything that I'd wanted to say. (At this point I'd had quite a few drinks, but he'd only had two since he needed to drive home later.) He then says ""Look I want to say something, and it's probably inappropriate, but... Well look, I'm kind of tempted to just say we should have sex, because you know, maybe that will help""

I thought we were completely platonic. We've been good friends for over three years now, and I have never once thought about him sexually.

I didn't know what to do. I kind of just made a disapproving noise, and he backpedaled pretty hard, but he then started talking about how some friend of his had asked him the question ""do you have a female friend who you wouldn't sleep with, if the opportunity arose?"" and he was so astounded when he realized that, no, he doesn't feel that he has any female friends like that. He said I was towards the bottom of the list, (uh, thanks?) but then qualified that by saying that it was only because he respected my SO so much (um *what?*), and then went on to say that if he'd known me in high school he would have had a massive crush on me, and I remind him of several of his ex's. He asked me if I felt that way about him too, he said he wanted to know ""just for my own self confidence"" and I just said I'd never thought about it, and I didn't want to think about it because I'm not giving up on my current relationship, I want to reevaluate it, not end it. I want to work things through with my SO, I'm not looking for options, I'm looking for support.

After that the topic was changed and we chatted about unrelated things for a while and then he drove home. He texted me the next day about some project he was working on, he knew I was seeing a move with some friends and asked how that went and I tried to respond normally, and then he texted me again saying that he keeps hearing songs that remind him of me. It's made me feel really uncomfortable and I don't know what to do.

I feel dirty. I feel horrible. I feel bad. I feel like my trust in him was misplaced, I feel betrayed by a friend. I feel like maybe it's partially my fault, was I giving off signs and I didn't realize? I feel dirty and hurt and betrayed, and becasue the sex thing was focused on by my other male friend before, I'm worried that all my male friends see me this way, and I definitely feel like I'm unable to trust any of them. I feel like that is over reacting, but women I love have been hurt by men they trusted before, and I'm so scared that I'm not over reacting at all.

I'm angry, and bitter, and hurt, and I don't feel safe around my friend anymore. 

I don't know what to do. I don't ever want to see him again (except maybe to punch him in his stupid face for making me feel so vulnerable, the feeling of which is not like me at all) but we work together, and he's friends with my SO and some of my SO's friends. Please help me.

He doesn't want kids. EVER.

I shoulder the blame and so does he for not talking more thoroughly about the child issue before marriage. We talked about every thing except that. Our only reference to kids was on our first date where we both declared we didn't want to get married, didn't believe in love, or want to have kids. A year later we were married and madly in love. 

The first two years of our marriage I let him know I really did want kids. He vacillated between ""you'd be beautiful pregnant, and I don't want kids right now."" I am 26, still logically have plenty of time to have kids. But my biological clock is going off like a nuke. I even like screaming babies in restaurants. 

Things have gotten so bad that I'm ready to give him an ultimatum. Bear children with me kids or I will leave. On one hand I want to go curl up in a ball in a closet and pretend I never said it.

Dealing with potential mates that could be psychopaths, men with STDs, people with horrific personality quirks, someone that could truly hurt me (I was in a very horrific relationship before I met my husband where my ex attempted to kill me). 

My Questions: Has anyone dealt with something similar? Did he change his mind? Does this mean that he doesn't love me as much as I thought, if he's ready to let me leave over a child. Can I survive on my own? Where do I even start to sort this out?

Tl:Dr My husband doesn't want kids, I do. I have told him I will leave if he doesn't give me at least one child. He still says ""I don't want kids"". This guy is absolutely perfect in every other way, except the baby clause, I love him so much.

1267249669.0,"Ladies, I'm in need of some ethical guidance. I've just been told I'm a horrible person (I disagree), and I need a second opinion.","First, some background info. I am a hot-blooded hot bisexual male (pardon the relative lack of modesty, but I've been told that I'm a 9 or 10). I lean toward guys, but I can't consist on gentlemen alone, so I'll frequently pick up ladies on the side. The guys I'm with are almost always okay with this (as long as I'm safe). The ladies, not so much. 

A few of friends and I were discussing sexual conquests and I told them about my way of finding girls who would be ok with being just a fuckbuddy on the side. The ideal girl for this is generally about a 4-7, socially awkward, and shy. She probably hasn't been in a relationship in a long time. There are a lot of little things that are indicators, and I've gotten very good at picking up girls who are willing.

The lady who was present was shocked. She told me that I was deliberately taking advantage of girls with low self esteem. I told her I thought I deserved points for being honest. I always practice safe sex, and the girls always enjoy it (again, pardon the lack of modesty, but I'm very good at giving orgasms). Almost every one of them says that I'm the hottest guy they've ever done it with and it was the best they've ever had (although this all could be just flattery).

I need an objective opinion. I'm honest with the girls, and I'm safe. I don't think I'm exploiting them, since they consent to it and enjoy it. So here's my question. Am I going to hell for this?

1677046465.0,"As a victim of abuse, I've always wondered why Family Guy hasn't seriously criticized or cancelled for the abuse of Meg and Brian?","**Serious TW: abuse, animal cruelty & neglect**

Edit: Put spoiler tags around potentially triggering stuff.


So, I've been getting shown a ton of those tiktok-style clips of Family Guy on youtube lately. I hate that show. It's gross, disgusting, and it's rarely funny. I keep disliking them, hoping the YT algorithm will get it, but nope. I keep seeing them. I see those damn tiktoks and sometimes, it literally triggers memories of when I was abused because it's **so similar to what happened to me**. Even the scenes where Meg lashes out against other members of the family. 

What has honestly horrified me all over again was just how badly everyone in that damn show just abuses Meg and even Brian (at times). It's disturbing how casually it's done, with no regard for her, and how nasty and downright cruel every character can be towards her. Calling it abuse seems like a massive understatement, because it's so bad I dont know what else to call it..

Potentially triggering stuff behind the spoiler tag. 

>!What really made me nauseated was an episode where Meg was tricked into getting an abortion by her own father...And a scene where Brian was so badly neglected his nails were longer than his fur and he could only shuffle around. Of course it the punchline to a joke. Or a scene where Meg gives graphic details about how her brother has verbally abused her and it's just shrugged off!< 

And I can't help but wonder why it hasn't been a bigger target for criticism? In a world where abusers are so heavily demonized, it should receive more criticism. Right? It's not like the show's creators were trying to build up a character arc, where Meg becomes empowered enough to leave, works through her trauma and overcomes it to live a healthy life. They just didn't know how to write teenage girls. So rather than doing the smart thing and consulting someone, hiring more women or just avoiding writing a female character until their writing skills developed, they just decided to make her a literal punching bag and whipping post.

Like, I know it's a just a cartoon and it's meant to have an irreverant, nothing-is-sacred style of humor. I know I'm overthinking it and it's a first-world problem to have, but it's awful that Family Guy continues this trend of allowing Meg to horrifically abused and there has been no sustained movement to convince the showrunners to stop allowing her to be abused.",TwoXChromosomes

1474531155.0,I had the most unprofessional cardiologist while at the hospital last week.,"I have been fuming about this for days and I'm hoping this is the right subReddit to talk about this. Apologies in advance as I am on mobile I'm not sure if it will format correctly. 

For the past few weeks I suddenly developed some pretty alarming symptoms. I should have gone in sooner but I was so close to my insurance kicking in through my new job that I tried to wait. I had begun passing out multiple times a week, and a few times it happened multiple times in a day. It happened without warning most of the time, but I decided to finally suck it up and go when I was informed that while I was out this particular night, my boyfriend told me my heartbeat was irregular. I immediately realized it could be far more serious than I'd imagined, grabbed my things and got a ride to the er. 

While checking in as soon as I mentioned my heart, I was immediately given an ekg and taken back to wait for the er doctor. I was put on a heart monitor as soon as I sat on the bed. 

The er doctor comes and asks me a million questions and explains that I have too long between parts of my heartbeat and that he believes I have something called long at syndrome, but that he also wanted to make sure it wasn't a blood clot or anything else. 

So some blood tests and chest x-rays later I am informed they would liken to admit me to the cardiac floor. I agree and about two hours later that's where I am. 


And then my cardiologist came in. 

He sat in a chair at the end of my bed as my boyfriend stood next to me and explains exactly what long at syndrome is, how difficult it is to really pin down a long qt diagnosis but how everything from my ekgs to my symptoms match up perfectly, and how the best form of treatment in his opinion is an implanted defibrillator, but that some patients are ok on simply a beta blocker. 

Up to this point everything is fine and everyone has been very professional. 

I asked him what the plan of action is, and he says to start on the beta blockers, which sounded fine until he mentioned why. I thought it was out of not rushing into heart surgery, which makes sense. But then he went on to tell me that the reason he doesn't want to implant a defibrillator in me is that because I'm young(28) and  thin (I'm 5'7 and about 120) he doesn't want to implant something in my chest that will make me self conscious at the beach in a bikini. He said yes we are taking a risk in doing that, but you don't want to have this (he held one up as he said this) sticking out of your chest at the beach making you look weird. 

And then he even said that it would be hard to explain to my daughter what it was (she's six) and that its appearance may be scary to her. So he thinks while yes, it's a risk, that its a worthwhile one. 


Personally, I don't give a good goddamn if I have that sticking out in a bikini, and I know my daughter would understand and probably think it's even cool. What I don't want someone to have to explain to my child is why her mother died because her doctor wanted to take a risk so my tits stay pretty. 

For fuck's sake. I'm not pretending to be some expert here, I don't know if the implant is the best choice right now or not. But if it's not, I want a reason better than telling me it's so I'll look good in a fucking bikini. The pros of an implant were all medical but the only cons were about physical appearance. That is not how serious medical decisions need to be made when they concern whether or not my heart keeps beating. 




[edited to add]

I made it very very clear that if the implant was the best option that my bikini body was the least of my concerns. 

Multiple times. 

I have a family to take care of. I have a life I want to live. An implant that I was blatantly told was my best option was refused because of what I look like. 

One of my closest friends has one. Within 48 hours of his diagnosis he was out of surgery. Nobody said a single word to him about him not getting one so he'd look good at the beach. 

I understand explaining to me how the implant will be visible and all of that. That of course is something that should be done. 

But to tell me it's absolutely the best option and then say he won't do it because of what I'll look like at the beach over and over and over is insane to me. 

I asked multiple times if there were any negatives other than looks and the only one was that the battery must be changed every ten years or so. Which I knew watching my friend over the years and I'm completely comfortable with. 

When a doctor refuses to take the best course of action and instead decides to tell you he wants you to take a different approach that he likens to Russian roulette, I don't understand how that's ok. ",TwoXChromosomes

1410624087.0,Father-in-Law is threatening to undermine my parenting,"Hi /r/TwoXChromosomes,

I'm looking for some advice on how to deal with my overbearing father-in-law. I've been a vegetarian for 9 years now and a vegan for 5. I'm perfectly healthy. I get regular checkups and bloodwork that always agree that I get plenty of everything I need to be a healthy individual. Four years ago I married the woman of my dreams and two years I gave birth to our little boy, Silas. Now, the FIL was never overjoyed that his little girl was marrying a woman but he got over it and he's been friendly to me even though he skipped our wedding. All water under the bridge. The issue now is Silas.

FIL wants to spend more time with our little guy. Silas has been vegan from day one. I breastfed him and when we weaned him off, we never considered putting him on animal products because the very idea is atrocious to us. Silas is a healthy, happy little boy. We keep in close contact with his pediatrician who has given us a 100% green light to keep on with his vegan diet. My wife and I  are both vegan and we've done a lot of research on how to keep up with the dietary needs of a growing child while remaining plant based. 

Back to the FIL. He wants to have Silas for overnights every so often. I wouldn't have a problem with this (it would be nice to have a night off soemtimes!) but his attitude is very much ""my house, my rules"" which I know would mean we'd find out that Silas had a cheeseburger for dinner and eggs and bacon for breakfast if we left him there. This is absolutely unacceptable to me. If Silas chooses to eat animal products when he's grown, that's his choice, but at 2 years old his parents should be making those decisions for him as he does not have the agency to understand the inherent issues.

I understand the ""my house, my rules"" mentality but in this case I feel like ""my kid, my rules"" trumps that, regardless of where we are. My wife wants her dad to develop a strong relationship with our son but she's not as firm in her beliefs and I don't think she'll stand up for the rules that we have in place regarding our son. FIL KNOWS that Silas is vegan but the issue is trivial to him so he refuses to take it seriously. How can I establish firm rules when I won't be there to enforce them? Should I just continue coming up with excuses that my son can't do an overnight at his grandpa's? Thanks for any input and sorry for the wall of text!

To say I was excited about watching this movie would be an understatement. I got geared up in my Captain Marvel t-shirt to go by myself tonight because I just moved to a new city and don't know anybody.

I got to the theater early and picked out a prime seat. As people started filing in, a guy a couple rows ahead kept trying to make eye contact with me. I wasn't engaging because I just wanted to focus on the movie but when the screen wasn't showing video properly during the previews I decided to go tell a manager that there was an issue.

I grew up with a very strong friendship with a group of 5 girls in HS and I was a member of a sorority in college and value many of those friendships to this day.  However, now, living in a new city as an adult I have SUCH a hard time making and keeping girlfriends!! We have lived here about 3 years.

Now, I want to get this out of the way, I am pretty and successful and I have an equally good looking and successful live in boyfriend.  I definitely have my own problems but in the age of social media, my life looks pretty damn perfect.  However I have NO friends.  I think it is wearing on our relationship that I don't have any friends.

I became close friends with some old coworkers and things went fine for a while.  I was in a relationship, but several of them were single so I would go out with them to the bars.  Like I said before,  I am pretty introverted and the last thing I would ever call myself is a flirt.  However, it became somewhat of a problem that guys would come over and chat up my friends for 30 minutes, only to ask to be introduced to me by the end.  So i gradually stopped being invited.   I would see their pictures on instagram, but i understood so I just let it go and we would instead do things during the day, go hiking, to the movies, etc.  It got worse when on two separate occasions, a girl's boyfriend asked if she could pull me in for a threesome.  That almost immediately ended two friendships.  The rest of the girls would make comments to me like, ""i bet if you go talk to that guy, he'd buy our tickets for us"" or ""things aren't as easy or us as they are for you.""  It was jokes but, this quickly got pretty toxic for me. I stopped putting in as much effort to see them, I noticed that they made no effort to pull me back in.

Since then,  I have gone out of my way to make friends from trying to hang out with my boyfriends female friends,book clubs, softball teams, etc.  It was pretty clear to me from the very beginning that one of his friends had a crush on him and that I was a huge hindrance to her plans.  The rest of them are like undyingly loyal to her and have never been nice to me.  Three years later, I think she is over it, but I have still never been accepted.  Outside of them,  I have made a few friends, girls and guys.  Typically any friendship with a guy ends either the first time his SO meets or sees a picture of me.  Girls usually last a little longer before they start making comment my old friends did.  If I ever complain about anything I get things like ""it must be so hard to be you"" after I've patiently listened to their problems with work or boyfriends. 

I have had this problem for so long, but I feel like it is taboo to talk about it.  No one feels bad for you because you are pretty. But honestly I'm awfully lonely.",TwoXChromosomes

I'm posting from my throwaway account so this post won't be tracked down to real-life me. 

I live in a rather large, progressive city in Canada that has a small, tight knit feminist community. I recently found out that my abusive ex boyfriend is hosting events themed around consent in bars that identify as safe-spaces. It's very frustrating. 

1) I feel a lot of anger towards the people who know what happened in our relationship and continue to support him as an artist/spokesperson in the community. (By going to his events.)
2) I feel very unsafe in these places designated as safe-spaces.
3) Most importantly, I am actively concerned for the emotional, physical and sexual well-being of the women who are going to these events. 

The last time he contacted me, I outlined clearly how what he had done was rape, and how our relationship was abusive. Although he had been looking for reconciliation, he never responded. I've been through a lot of therapy over this relationship, and I feel like I am able to move on from it. I also feel a duty to warn my community about him, particularly because I've been contacted by other women he has hurt. 

The irony of this situation is frustrating. I don't know what to do. I don't want a lynch mob, I do want women to be safe.

1426952782.0,"Hey girls, could you offer some help please?","Hi, I am in my final year at the University of Dundee studying Product Design. I have decided to base my final project around the female stereotyping that occurs when it comes to females fixing their car. My primary aim is to give women a greater sense of confidence when it comes maintaining their car or vehicle. In addition to this a further objective of mine is try to influence women‚Äôs interests and knowledge when it comes to car maintenance. 

Primary research that I undertook, tends to show that ""Cars"" are ranked 2nd highest in the product categories when it comes to the dissatisfaction of a product. This is true when looking at women‚Äôs feedback. 

Therefore, after an awful lot of research, (including techniques such as focus groups) and thought, I have ultimately made the choice to redesign a tool kit for the car that will include the most basic tools to change a car tire, whilst at the same time directly marketing this particular product/toolkit towards women. 

Furthermore, the tool kit will include a booklet that will give the consumer relevant and easy information on how to change a car tire, whilst also including tips and further instructions for basic maintenance needed for a ""healthy car"". 
This booklet will also include the steps that a woman will need to follow if they get into an accident, regardless of whether it is their fault or not. In order for women to stay relatively clean, and injury free throughout any maintenance undertaken on the car, my toolkit will include gloves, wet wipes and plasters. I am aiming to make this tool kit look very elegant, and professional whilst at the same time, ensuring it is something females would consider purchasing. 
However, any ideas from you girls would be extremely constructive and incredibly useful for my idea. Questions such as ‚ÄúWhat do you think about my concept‚Äù, and ‚Äúwhat other items or factors do you think I should consider‚Äù, would certainly help me whilst designing this tool kit. Therefore, any ideas or suggestions would be extremely welcome, and may well lead to a better product in the meantime.

1424884402.0,Why don't Kurdish Females who fight ISIS get more feminist attention?,"I found this absolutely shocking the level of disregard feminists and ""women interest communities"" have for Kurdish female resistance to isis.  There is an active war going on with one side being the most misogynistic and backwards people ever and the other actual women soldiers dying and fighting on the front lines.

Yet, for the most part none of the ""female media"" cover it at all and feminists really don't talk about it. Women actively fighting a group trying to enslave or massacre them and remove all of their basic human rights get virtually no attention or coverage.  

I'm just wondering if anyone else has noticed this and what the cause might be? Is it just how out of touch with reality western feminism has become or is there something about the conflict that make them want to ignore it?

1400482152.0,"People were complaining about ""consent workshops"" at my uni, so I wrote an article about it.","I'd love to hear what /r/TwoXchromosomes think. Basically the situation is the Women's Campaign have pressured the student union into hosting consent workshops. Feminist stories have been met with criticism in the comments section of the student newspaper, The Tab. So I decided to write this.

**The FemiNazis are getting us to do consent workshops now.**


**Hostility to feminism is unfortunately popular in Cambridge.** But the cries of ‚ÄúFeminazi‚Äù are sadly ironic, because this is not a women‚Äôs issue. Stanley Milgram used his famous social experiment to suggest that Nazi officers were not warped people: they were normal people who committed evil because of the urge in every human being to follow social convention. With this in mind, a perspective needs to be shared. Lad culture threatens to blur the line between social convention and assault. It is men, not feminists, who must confront this head on.


**But why are these workshops needed in the first place?** Do people really believe all men are lecherous perverts who need a good talking to in order to keep their man parts tucked in? Well, no. And hopefully the Women‚Äôs Campaign doesn‚Äôt either. The aims of this are to tackle lad culture, and stop victim blaming. Legitimate goals with legitimate reasons for pursuing. Firstly, victim blaming is rife. Remarks such as, ‚ÄúPeople drink themselves into these situations,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt sounds like she was definitely kissing back,‚Äù are not uncommon, especially on the Tab. Even if these viewpoints are valid in some situations, they‚Äôre not going to help us deal with sexual violence. That much should be obvious. Remarks such as ‚ÄúWhy did he do that?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do so many men think this is acceptable behaviour?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do men keep abusing women?‚Äù These are the questions that will get us somewhere. And it needs to be men asking other men. We need unabusive men to challenge their friends when they say something misogynistic. Instead of laughing along, shouldn‚Äôt we oppose it? Shouldn‚Äôt we say, ‚ÄúHey that could be my sister you‚Äôre talking about. I don‚Äôt appreciate it?‚Äù Only when men lose social status amongst their friends for being misogynistic will we start to see meaningful progress. Only then will the harm of lad culture have ended.


**And let‚Äôs be clear: lad culture is pernicious because it has arisen out of a desire for social status.** It plays on men‚Äôs insecurities and doubts about relationships and popularity. It is not the twisted reality of a parallel universe where Robin Thicke is Equality minister and Katie Hopkins is Women of the Year. It is the logical conclusion of an ever pervasive (and quite wrong) belief that girls are not interested in meek, accommodating, ‚Äúnice‚Äù men. That lacking sexual experience is tantamount to being a social outcast. That in order to be sexually successful you have to be a ‚Äúdick.‚Äù The past articles on the Tab on lad culture and assault have illustrated these situations are rarely clear-cut. Questions such as ‚ÄúIf she‚Äôs coming home with me, does she want me to make a move?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow drunk is too drunk?‚Äù have no one-word answer for all women. To some people (for reasons beyond my comprehension), drunk one-night stands are something to choose, want, and enjoy. They might be a small minority, but they exist. But for others who do not give their consent, it can be unacceptable and traumatic to even try. This highlights that a judgement call is needed. In that grey area, lad culture encourages men to make their decisions based on the likelihood of sexual and social gain instead of the wishes of the people involved. When men get these decisions wrong, that‚Äôs when assault happens. To address this, men must learn to be conscious of consent as much as their social status.


**But you might still be wondering why these workshops are to be compulsory.** I believe the answer is simple. This is not an issue about being sensitive to the ‚Äúplight of women,‚Äù stuck between the oppression of a male dominated society and the patronising goodwill of some sympathetic male protectors. This is a leadership issue. When a public figure is found guilty of sexual assault, they don‚Äôt need to be more sympathetic to women. They need leadership training. They have failed in their leadership. Although by this point it‚Äôs already too late; they also probably need to go to jail.


In Cambridge of all places, the leaders of tomorrow should understand that consent is the foundation of our non-Nazi society, and that challenging social convention is vital to this. I do not know whether these consent classes will be any good, but I do think I understand something about why they‚Äôre needed. It‚Äôs our responsibility as men to support them.

I separated from my friends and jumped in a taxi outside the club and told him to take me to my friends house. I told him I only had ¬£16 and he said that was fine (it usually costs ¬£30-¬£35)

I was trying to contact my friend but he doesn't get good signal, so drunk me was panicking thinking I was going to be abandoned at his house while he wasn't there. The taxi driver drove me around his village until I got through to him. The taxi driver then pulled up and said he ""was going to get me on the back seat and treat me nicely"" I told him no, I was going to my friends house. He then grabbed me and pulled me in for a kiss, kissed me and grabbed my boobs. He tried taking my pants down but I got out, and luckily my friends neighbour was there to help. It was 1am, she was in her 60s but she has no idea how much I appreciate her being there.

I was so exhausted on my commute home that I cried silently the whole way. I got home, told my husband that I'd cried from exhaustion and didn't have any energy left to hang out, but somehow we ended up in a deep philosophical discussion anyway, and when we didn't agree on the issue I felt the exhaustion shift to anger. I removed myself before saying anything too bad, but needed to get out of the house before I blew.

**Actual story:** So I walked my emotional eater self to the store to get a bag of chips, fuming all the way. Halfway there, a guy calls out to me from a parked car. ""Hey, good looking. How you doing?"" I stopped and turned, still fuming. How dare this guy objectify me when I'm so much more than this body. Hell, I'm a ball of rage! But apparently the world doesn't even recognize that. I'm still just a thing, there for his amusement.

""Who, me?""

""Yeah.""

""Fuck you!"" I threw my middle fingers up in the air with force. 

""Fuck you too!"" He laughed. ""Fuck the world!""

He kept on laughing as I stormed away, and other people on the street turned to look at me.

After this encounter I felt even more angry, and a little surprised that he wasn't taken aback by my response; he just rolled with the punches so easily. Where's the anger I wanted?!

Of course, on my way home, I walked a different route, fearing the whole time that I'd bump into him, and he'd want revenge in the form of rape.

**Post story:** Now I've calmed down, gone back to plain old exhaustion, and feel mixed about this. On the one hand, ""hell yeah!"" After controlling myself all week through one stress after another, I finally said what I wanted to without hesitation. It's a relief to not give a damn what someone else thinks. On the other hand, I did not act in the kind, empathetic, community-building way that I aspire to. I work so hard to crate a better world, and yet I poured anger and insults onto a stranger. So I guess I'm proud, understanding, and disappointed in myself all at the same time. 

**TL;DR: A guy catcalled me on the street and I yelled ""fuck you!""**

However, like most kids, she is not allowed to be good friends with guys, go to movies with friends, wear certain kinds or clothes or go to far away places on her own. I am older than her but I face similar restrictions. Today, my mom really got angry and shouted at us for at least an hour because my sister asked if she can go out with friends. We can't go outside and do anything because she is so paranoid. And this is not unfounded. Where I live, newspapers are flooded about women rapes, harassment and murder. Girls as young as 3 years old to women older than 70 have been a victim at the hands of drivers, workers, teachers, relatives and even immediate family members; fathers, brothers etc. Everyday feels like a burden. I can't do so many things that most people take for granted. But most of all I can't walk in public places without the fear that I will be groped. Every place, every class, every mall, every guy is a potential threat to my dignity and safety. All because we constantly live in the fear that one of the horrifying things we learn of, might happen to us. 
And this situation is aggravated by the insensitivity and ignorant mindset of people. ""It is the girl's fault."" ""How dare a women was seen outside at 7 p.m with a boy"". I could go on. And most of these comments are from politicians, party leaders, policemen etc. People who swore to protect us. One of them said that boys have urges and they were having fun. While others proclaim that it is the fault of the women and she should be married by 16 and under the control of her husband. The list goes on to be more absurd and upsetting. 
I am sure what I have written above has been written a thousand times. Where an angry, desperate woman demands answers for such cruelty. This is nothing new and there is a constant battle. But it is so maddening. To always live in fear. To not being able to trust anybody. You know how sick it feels when some shirtless worker stares you suggestively every time you go out of the house. Every. Fucking.Time. Where you are constantly judged by women and men alike for wearing shorts or hanging out with a guy? Of just being preached and preached and preached... about traditions, and values and family honor? Of staying at home being worried to death because your daughter/sister was five minutes late? Just because I am a women? WHY? Why can't for once people stick their heads out of their asses and let other live peacefully? I just hope that one day I could live the way I want. Trust people.

But is it really a personal choice? 

Increasing your breast size is suggesting that there is something wrong with a smaller chest.

Fixing your nose, suggests that what you have already isn't preferable. 

So who sets these preferences? It can't be you alone. A preference is a choice between options. So someone has pointed out that A is preferable to B. 

So to me, maybe you disagree and I encourage a discussion, it seems that plastic surgery isn't a personal choice. 
It is a very visible protest of what you think should be the norm or acceptable. Does that make sense? The more people opt for surgery to enhance and change the way they look, the more post opt bodies and faces become acceptable and in a way preferable to all the different non homogenous faces and bodies in nature.

At the moment I know 6 people in my circle of friends, family and acquaintances who have opted for surgery. Of the procedures: implants, rhinoplasty, tummy tuck, injections, lipo. They also have a laundry list of additional procedures they look forward to. One of these individuals makes her career as a fitness model and spokesperson for all things ""healthy"" and loving your body no matter what...

A little background: I am a tomboy, and I was raised a tomboy. I happen to like a lot of things that most males like, and as a result, have gained the acceptance of many men as someone they can associate with who isn't ""just another chick.""

Now, with that being said, I am incredibly grateful for the feminist movement over a century ago. I am grateful for the relative equality I have under the law concerning my rights to the privileges men enjoy. We are able to vote, employers are not allowed to discriminate based on gender, and we may come and go as we please without the approval of men. Why is there any reason to complain?

Insecurities. Feminism has now shifted to what bothers women. Things such as the objectification of women or how women make less money than men, on average, have become hot topics. While those are topics I can agree with on a certain extent, it still pisses me the fuck off. Feminism has now given women the power to bitch and moan on a large scale. Currently, being a feminist is to indirectly admit that you feel threatened by society, that you are somehow incompetent and inferior.

Here's why: most feminists I know are out to prove to the the male world that they are every bit as strong, intelligent and productive as they are. While I find women who are intelligent and thoughtful to be admirable, the problem lies within the fact that the feminist movement is driven by emotions. Unfortunately, the intention to become educated and strong is no longer for the woman herself, but to avoid any patronizing remarks from men. 

Not only do I believe it is largely unproductive, but it is backwards. Ironically, feminists have let men control the way women are perceived in society by allowing petty emotions get in the way of societal reform for women.

I know that a lot of TwoXers are afraid to fall in love or are tired of the way some men act around them. I just wanted to let you know girls that there are a lot of men that will hurt you, but once in a while, you will find an exceptional man and yes, THEY EXIST! Here's why:

-He is not the most romantic man, but from our first kiss up until now, he has been 100% commited to me and our relationship.
 
-I am not bad looking, but some women can look much sexier than me, and for the life of me, he doesn't look at other women. I have NEVER seen him look at another women the way he looks at me everyday. He says I'm beautiful minimum twice a day, and mean it.

-Sometimes I can feel depressed and self-counscious and he can always tell. I can see that he gets uncomfortable and sad when I am in that kind of mood. At this point, He will try ANYTHING to cheer me up. (he will ask me if I want to talk about it, He will tickle me, he will do a puppet show with our dog, anything.) He is my rock.

-I absolutly knew I wanted to grow old with this man when I noticed the way he treats me, other women, kids, elderlies and especially his parents/siblings. I swear I have never met a more respectful person. And not the fake kind of respect, the genuine kind of respect.

-In almost 6 years of relationships, I have only seen him get mad a few times and everytime, it was because someone was attacking either me, my family or his family.

-It's pretty much impossible to have full-blown fights with him because he is so reasonable. I never realized how mature and sexy it can be when a man can say ""I'm sorry"". It's pretty hard to continue a fight when he already said ""I'm sorry, hurting you is the last thing I want to do, I'll be more careful next time. Now come here and give me a kiss sexypants!""   

-Let's just say that he's not a selfish lover. ;)

-He supports me both financially and emotionally while I am at school full-time and work part-time. We pretty much have an opposite schedule but he never held-it against me. He appreciates and takes advantage of the little time we have at home. 
 
-He is also my personnal life coach. When we met, I used to be this huge ball of stress that over-thinked everything. I was more negative and not self-confident. He basically taught me how to chill, appreciate the moment and the little things. His company calms me.

I'll start this off by saying my boyfriend isn't a sexist jerk. He does however, believes that feminism is evil, and people who actually fight for equality aren't feminists, but some other group. He wants equality for everyone, but doesn't understand that that's what feminism is. He told me that true feminism is believing in the patriarchy, when I've always known it as furthering equality for both women and men (unless I'm wrong here?). 

What I need is help for sources that show evidence that feminism is not women oppressing and ruining men's lives. I've done some searching, but I can't seem to pinpoint good articles or sources, as I'm not quite sure what to search for. I see a lot of posts here in the sub that would be good, but since there's not a lot of ""sourcing"" that he cares so much about, I worry it wont be enough. 

What can I tell or show him that would change his mind, or at least get him to think about it?


EDIT: I should have clarified, I don't care about his views. He cares about mine, and that's this issue I'm facing. He wants me to either agree with him or prove that my side isn't horrible. ",TwoXChromosomes

It's understandable why someone would pick on me. I look defenseless and it's true. I'm not good with confrontation and I don't come across as someone who is hard to mess with. 

Now this woman has been complained about from several students in the class. She will talk to people about her trashy baby daddy problems, without them asking about it since gee I don't know they don't give a shit? She also walks into class talking loudly on her phone about how so and so didn't show up to court or whatever....yeah jerry springer would adore the shit out of this unfortunate mess.

Anyway she seems to think it was me who complained and now every time she walks by me she whispers dork and bitch and will talk shit about me to whoever listens...seriously I literally did NOTHING. I talked to the teachers assistant and basically said to do nothing since there's no point.

I feel like if I accommodate her petulant behavior by moving to the other side of the class I'll look like a push over but if I confront her I'll either look just as bad or plain stupid since it's hard to take me seriously in that sense. Part of me is saying that you can't reason with someone with the immaturity of a 15 year old and to not let it bother me. But the other part of me hates being pushed around and I don't want to drop and retake the class, since I need the credit to transfer. Especially if its over something that is out of my control.

These types of people might do any combination of trying to take up too much of your time and attention, they act like you're existing just for them, ask really intrusive questions, make creepy comments, talk way too much about themselves, keep insisting their opinions until you oblige and agree, and just giving off this really slimy persistence of cornering you into an interaction even though you've clearly given several indications that the conversation has ended a long time ago, if you even wanted to start it at all.

1654054096.0,Lets clear up some myths about domestic abuse,"The recent domestic abuse trial has been on everyones feed lately, along with a tsunami of misinformation from incels, redpillers, and the manosphere, as well as those retweeting, upvoting, and sharing their content unaware of the harmful myths they spread.

**Fact: Studies repeatedly show that men are more likely to** [disbelieve women](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01544182)**, to** [endorse rape myths](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260505276072)**, to blame victims, and to exaggerate claims that women lie.**

1. **Myth: It was mutual abuse.** ""Abuse is about one person exploiting a power dynamic in an attempt to control and manipulate someone else... The idea of ""mutual abuse"" conveniently ignores the power imbalance that's inherent in an abusive dynamic. And in doing so, it often removes the distinction between the cruelty abusers wield to belittle, tear down and isolate their victims, and the cruelty those victims respond with when they feel backed up against a wall."" [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-testimony-pushes-mutual-abuse-nonsense-rcna26709)
2. **Myth: A significant number of women make false accusations.** This is a classic lie perpetuated by misogynists everywhere in hopes of casting doubt on women who come forward as victims of violence. FACT: Sexual assault remains dramatically underreported. [Source](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/sexual-assault-remains-dramatically-underreported).  [Another Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45565684).
3. **Myth: Society is too quick to believe accusations made by women.** Even female survivors are herded and separated and pitted against each other by misogynists. For instance, this [article](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a40116993/why-are-so-many-survivors-supporting-johnny-depp/) describes the 'just world fallacy', in which conservative women who survived assault blame other women for being less conservative. For not ""following the rules"". Whats worse is that MRA/Incel/Manosphere groups weaponize these women to legitimize sexist movements ([example1](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/us/campus-sex-assault-mothers.html), [example2](https://titleixforall.com/contact-staff/), [example3](https://www.saveservices.org/about/board/), [example4](https://www.facecampusequality.org/about-us)). ""That power is one of the tangible benefits of being a sexist woman, which conservative women accept as a trade-off for never being equal.""
4. **Myth: The #metoo movement has created too much support for women relative to the support given to men.** Women need more support, as they are more likely to experience domestic and [workplace](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/04/04/sexual-harassment-at-work-in-the-era-of-metoo/) harassment, and are [less physically capable](https://www.livestrong.com/article/509536-muscular-strength-in-women-compared-to-men/) of fighting back to protect themselves (the average woman possess only 2/3rds of the applied force of a man).Gaslighting is a core feature of intimate abuse, and prevents women from accessing resources ([source](http://www.nationalcenterdvtraumamh.org/%20wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NCDVTMH_NDVH_%20MHSUCoercionSurveyReport_2014-2.pdf)). Abusers use gaslighting via gendered stereotypes, structural vulnerabilities related to race, nationality, and sexuality; and institutional inequalities against victims to erode their realities. ([source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122419874843)).Even women hesitate to believe each other. ""Other women look for reasons to believe they are different form the survivor as a way to calm their fears and convince themselves that they are safe as long as they make ""better choices"". As part of this process, they focus their attention on [empathizing with the perpetrator](https://www.proquest.com/openview/cb85487fa25cb34271132523ebda9e06/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), which is less psychologically distressing than reckoning with violence."" ([source](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a40116993/why-are-so-many-survivors-supporting-johnny-depp/)).
5. **Myth: Abuse is rare.** 10-50 percent of women ***report*** having been hit or physically assaulted by an intimate partner at some time in their lives ([source](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Domestic+and+sexual+violence+and+abuse&author=C+Itzin&author=A+Taket&author=S.+Barter-Godfrey&publication_year=2010&)).

6. **Myth: There already is a large volume of support for female victims.** False for a number of reasons. [The witch-hunt of AH](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-verdict-we-ve-all-lost-n1295801) has shown that the manosphere is ready to devote extreme resources to making an example out of a domestic abuse victim - their actions are a threat to all women. [Abused women are extremely limited in what they can do to protect themselves](https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/how-far-can-abused-women-go-to-protect-themselves), and this article sheds light on how women fighting back against rapists and abusers continue to be charged with murder.
7. **Myth: Everyone said he was a warm, loving, caring man - therefore he could not have been an abuser.** The reason so many abusers do not get caught is because they have mastered outward [charisma and charm](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/why-bad-looks-good/201804/behind-the-fa-ade-the-socially-charming-domestic-abuser), fooling anyone from the [immediate family](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/why-bad-looks-good/201804/behind-the-fa-ade-the-socially-charming-domestic-abuser), [the congregation](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/27/1101734793/southern-baptist-sexual-abuse-list-released), to a network of [public supporters](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deuxmoi/comments/v1bljh/list_of_ahjd_abuse_myths_debunked_part_2/).
8. **Myth: She didn't leave because she wasn't being abused.** The reason it is extremely difficult for women to leave abusive relationships (and stand up for themselves thereafter) is because the abuser [oscillates between abuse and love bombing, psychologically conditioning the victim into being trapped](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768593/). Another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768593/) explains that ""the perpetrator alternates between violent, abusive and apologetic behaviour with apparently heartfelt promises to change and that the abuser could be very pleasant most of the time"".
9. **Myth: The abuse stops after she leaves.** Many perpetrators continue to harass, stalk, and harm the victim long after she has left him, sometimes even resulting in someone's death. [In one US study](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=Am+Psychol&title=Psychology+and+domestic+violence+around+the+world&author=LE+Walker&volume=54&publication_year=1999&pages=21-9&), 70 percent of reported injuries from domestic violence occurred after the separation of the couple.
10. **Myth: Women abuse men just as much as men abuse women.** Although both men and women initiate violence, the violence enforced by women is less frequent and has less severe consequences compared to male offenders ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18471583)). The National Family Violence Survey found that the injury rate for women was 600% higher than for men ([source](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Domestic+violence&author=E+Buzawa&author=CG+Buzawa&publication_year=2003&)).

But the thing that stood out to me the most in this terrible movie was the huge lack of women.  There were about 15 speaking roles for apes, and literally 1 woman in the movie who had a name.  And I don't even remember it, that's how little she mattered.  She was basically the plus one to the main male human, and spent the whole time validating him.  Her lines all consisted of all things like, ""You were SO BRAVE."" and ""Take me with you!""  and ""I'm worried about you.""

They also had a female ape, played by the amazingly talented Judy Greer, who did nothing more than give birth and get sick to motivate the main ape character.

In an ideal world, no one would hit anyone. But they do, unfortunately. I do think that if a woman attacks a man, she shouldn‚Äôt expect to not get hit back in self-defense. But that‚Äôs just it. Self-defense. A lot of these videos you see have the man going completely overboard. There‚Äôs a line you just don‚Äôt cross if you‚Äôre trying to defend yourself.

Some people said it‚Äôs sexist because I‚Äôm ‚Äúputting all responsibility on the man‚Äù, but honestly, it works both ways; the responsibility is on the *defender*.

Because some people got offended that a scientist wore a pin-ups shirt on TV, suddenly feminism is a joke or no longer relevant, and all modern-day feminists are just ""butt-hurt"" and looking to get offended by any little thing.

Um, no. I am a feminist because I am appalled that in 2015, in still many countries around the world, women are afraid for their lives--afraid to leave their houses unless they are covered head-to-toe and accompanied by a man, afraid to get an education or to work, afraid of being beaten and raped because the laws and culture say this is ok. I am appalled that in many countries, including the US, we have or are moving towards laws that could imprison women for having a miscarriage. I am appalled when young girls have their clitoris removed due to ""tradition"", when sex-selective abortion and infanticide is encouraged, when women are much more likely to be stoned to death for cheating on her husband (or god-forbid, being raped). While there are certainly other issues tied up in here above and beyond gender, there is no denying the fact that these issues happen because someone is female, and females are still considered as less-than by many. 

True, what I am offended about doesn't get as much national media attention as the latest Tumblr argument over the most recent Jezebel opinion piece.

Feminism is the movement that gave women the right to vote and have their voices heard, the right to be free from violence and ownership, the right to be treated as *people*. How can we just turn our backs on the very real and ongoing history that is the oppression of women by male-dominated societies? This is not vilifying men, it is simply acknowledging a truth--a truth like that of slavery and racial oppression; a truth that can be rectified, if we choose for it to be. 

Now, I completely understand and agree when people say they are annoyed when feminism takes precedence over other important issues, or that Western feminism is too white-washed and middle-class, too narrow-focused and exclusive. I agree with these statements. But does the answer truly need to be denouncing feminism entirely, instead of revising it? Are we truly at that point in our history as a society, or world-wide, where feminism is no longer needed anywhere, or where it's become more harmful than good?

Much like her I grew out of that and changed my looks completely. Now I sort of look like Fiona from shameless but ""better"" looking (so you guys get an idea of what I look like) . Anyway the guy I'm dating is that guy that's popular and god looking and all his friends are as well. Recently I've been getting hit on a lot especially by his really good looking friends. Now the issue here is that since I was so ugly at some point in my life I can't see my self as that good looking girl these guys are looking at. (don't get me wrong I'n not saying I'm a godess). I see myself as that pudgy looking brace face girl... I can't look at myself and say damn I'm hot. I don't know if this is how I really look (pudgy ugly and nerdy) or how these guys see me as an attractive, cool and funny girl. I see myself as average (on a good day) and maybe even completely below it regularly. I feel like a lot of the time these guys just hit on me because they see me that day in a fairly good light but regularly they'd see the real ugly version of me. I don't know if maybe I still haven't grown out the bad image I have of myself or if I'm that person I see.

TL;DR Was fat ugly and nerdy. Did a 180 (i get hit on a lot) but I still see myself as ugly and feel they do it maybe out of pity.

Question here is: what do I do to see myself as everyone see's me and how do I not let this new found beauty get to my head.",TwoXChromosomes

1686503410.0,The gender wars: Are we just as prejudiced as them in this thread?,"Correction: Subreddit, not thread.

Edit: since I've always been in the sub but haven't really browsed it until recently, I've just been seeing posts by men in the comments who are just straight up creepy/have an agenda. And there seems to be more of this than comments/posts that degrade or insult mens gender. The negativity directed at their general population in this subreddit makes more sense to me now. To those labeling me as a pick me girl whatever, it's not as far from men calling other men simps for empathizing with women. Just say you're not capable of constructive conversations and move on. To other comments, thank you for sharing your perspective. I've been out of the loop for a long time, and also due to how my experiences in my country isn't as severe as some have shared here. Now I think so many men in the US are more than deserving of the intolerance lmao. The minority of good men should get it and understand where this is all coming from. 

Long post ahead because I really kinda... care about this. Though I'm skeptical of posting this because most might (?) not wanna hear it (???) Or I would end up being called a man? Lol idk

Sooo- hi! I'm just here to address my fellow women to keep conversations open for everyone, despite the topics being about womanhood... I believe society in this day and age is in a *dire* situation with gender wars, arguments about men and women always popping left and right online...and that the few amount of wholesome conversations about genders could perhaps be more acknowledged (rarely happens with me but when it does omg you could only imagine my relief). Because if not, a lot will just come to a conclusion that negative behavior from men are normal. When it's just a matter of sensationalism (I for one have many positive experiences with males, may it be strangers, my bf, friends, but they're not post-worthy, not as ""juicy"" or ""interesting"" as the negative ones, y'know what I mean?) It's inevitable to share those negative aspects of men, so I guess it'd be nice for a change if other men who willingly look into women's experiences are given a chance. Because there's this immense gap when it comes to being aware about each other between XX and XY.

Just wondering if the ladies here are trying not to hate on men in general, because some comments are... Well kind of hostile towards men when they're obviously curious about the differences between men and women, while some men here I've seen are just plain rude (which is odd bc why even check a post from this sub if so) but they're really few, as I bet some men here aren't even known as men due to how open they are in understanding women's problems with men üò≠ 

I personally have issues with some men in my life (father and older brother) I was a misandrist for several years while I was maturing, but I've had a wonderful long term bf that proved me wrong with the fact that a number of good men out there are just damn lowkey, for me they're rare. Which is why I care about empathy when it comes to the other gender so much (though my misandry at the time was never outspoken, and always only internalized). It's also because I think this tug-o-war just pushes young boys to be misogynistic, and young girls to be misandrist. While this hate is shown in different ways with the two genders, it's still... Hate. Condescendingly passive agressive or straightup offensive insults. While I see this prejudice exhibited by men, more, well I can't do anything about that. What I can talk about is how we can not be just like that. With that said, some may speculate this is misdirected, men are the ones that need to hear this, well. I don't think empathy is something that should be tallied. Besides, if women don't propagate  the gender wars when men start it or not, I think ppl will start realizing how pointless it is. So many young boys and girls have taken in this mentality (like me 5 years ago, 22 now). It's toxic.

Disclaimer before anyone jumps into conclusions, I'm not invalidating the negative experiences of women with men, I have those, too. I'm merely referring to the comments that generalize men bc I for one am not happy when men generlize women about anything. While men being aholes on this thread grants me the permission to reciprocate it in a cute platter, I don't pin it on their population.

Hope it's not such a naive thing to wish for the world, hope it's not just for a lost cause... Sighhh I'm just so legitimately sick of gender wars! From both women and men. I can't have constructive conversations with men most times even when we're agreeing on a lot of things because of this gender barrier, and I see a lot of fellow ladies who get hostile towards men fueled by personal reasons online that those men have no clue about -and the other way around, especially in Instagram and TikTok com sec. Lol. (Basically every socmed platforms, not as much in Reddit though which I'm thankful for.)


Well yeah that's it. Would like to know if anyone out there feels as worn out as I am from this stuff. Or any other insights. This isn't totally well written so I'm sorry if the structure has no flow. Just letting it out üòÆ‚Äçüí®

TLDR: Let's not direct the negative experiences we had with men to all men. I would even say, let's not be like the negative men we've interacted with online üòÇ that may hold more weight for more of us here, I guess. While I also generalize men, I don't do it reject their opinions, I do it to share my negative experiences with men.

And as a childless woman, I'm sick of it.

Most of us childless people know these things, and these comments are not helpful and only serve to minimize and invalidate the realities that childless people face.

We know people with kids *may* still end up alone in old age, but the fact is that if you have children you are significantly less likely to end up with no one to assist with your care and for those of us with no children and who will never have children for whatever reason, this is a reality that we must face and actively try to avoid through careful planning.

By the way, I know I'm going to downvoted to hell for this but most people exist because someone got horny so lets stop acting like having a planned pregnancy is a bad thing even if fear of being alone in old age was a motivating factor. Most people who have planned pregnancies have multiple reasons for wanting children, and if you want to get down to it, there are very few motives to reproduction that can't be argued to be selfish so lets stop dog piling on people who might take in to consideration old age in the matter.",TwoXChromosomes

I started transitioning like 18 months ago so it‚Äôs not an especially new thing.
My dad was fairly supportive etc even though he was his usual stubborn self.

As time went on he became less supportive and caring, and more inflammatory and distant. He will make comments about the way I dress, my relationship, my career, whatever he can poke a hole in.
When I talk to my girlfriends about the way he acts it doesn‚Äôt seem that uncommon, and I mostly chill with cis ladies. (I try not to let being trans be a large part of my identity, I‚Äôm a woman that happens to be trans)
Most of my friends have a generally low opinion of men, which is sad to me.

My dad has had a very outdated view of women historically, and relegated them to a housewife role. More recently he seems to understand we are equal, which is good.
Though he is still extremely right-wing/conservative which just does not align well with my beliefs, or my wife‚Äôs.

Beside the political stuff, which I always attempted to avoid, his attitude and behaviour led me to cease contact entirely.
I haven‚Äôt spoken to him for months and I am starting to exit the intense grief I have had for him since I made the decision.
My heart wept for him, but I knew this was what was best - at least for now.
He has made no attempt at apology or contact, so I assume he is simply not interested in being a part of my life.

My partner made me aware beforehand that there will be a nonbinary person so I won't misgender. I was looking forward to treat them like anybody else, respectfully and normal. I think it's really cool to unapologetically be who you are. I was kinda excited to meet such a cool person but I didn't want to show it. I think that's the bare minimum of being respectful.  
The whole group had a not-so-serious introduction round, kinda cringe but funny, some said childish stuff like their favourite color. I said my pronouns were she/her, to show solidarity. Was that wrong?  
A few times over the evening, the nonbinary person gave me some dirty looks. It seemed like they were disgusted with my look. I felt femme yesterday so I was kinda dolled up and in a dress.  
At one point, they asked me what I study and their response on me studying computer science was ""So you think you're really smart?"" I was dumbfounded. Most of the people yesterday were fellow cs students, and they are all very kind and non-judgemental people. They don't care how people dress or present, they are the least superficial people I know. Therefore I was really confused as I felt safe to come as I am and then felt massively judged by one person.

1644897265.0,Regarding an askmen post about ones favourite part of a woman.,"The very premise is the problem. Not OP or any of the comments, not one of them were intentionally doing anything wrong, I think pretty much everybody was celebrating an individual woman in their lives and qualifying it as all women by nature of the question.

But the question demands you answer ""what IS a woman, and of those qualifiers, which are your favourites?

We all know that social constructs don't break down into easy little bits. Biologically, psychologically, behaviorally, there's just so much variety to humans.

I see people saying defensively ""so I don't say body parts like tits and ass are my favourite, and you're still offended?""

I'm not offended really, I'm a bit bugged. Mostly I'm just not flattered by seeing the same societal norms being repeated. The ones forced upon many of us that are sometimes detrimental to our health, happiness, even our rights. Norms that harm men by othering them from certain roles.

If anybody else is feeling uncomfortable wit the quantity and reinforcement of comments that picture women's roles as carers, homemakers, social secretaries, teachers/therapists to their partners...remember the question is the problem, and you have every right to reject or accept those roles at any capacity and not feel bad for it.

I could never answer ""what's my favourite thing about men"" because I may as well follow up with ""which one?""

It makes my blood absolutely boil when they are not only transphobes but also misogynists. They act like women need saving, or they pretend they really care that (in their mind) women are being taken advantage of.

They don't care! Because when women tell them that trans athletes in women's sports are a small issue compared to lack of equal funding for women's sports, they don't listen. And when we point out all the truly important ways we are *actually* taken advantage of (women's unpaid care labor, the wage gap, etc.) they could NOT care less. They don't want to hear it. 

How dare they use women's own suffering and issues to hide behind while they spew hatred into the world. They don't care about women. They only pretend to care so they can say ""I'm only protecting women/girls!"" when they're called out for their hate.
